                           particular church or religious sect, ideology, or political party under

                           shall in all cases be  submitted first to an Investigation Committee of

                       Section 1. Coverage. This set of guidelines covers all CvSU faculty
                       members,  whether  permanent,  temporary,  or  contractual  teachers
                       reporting on full time.

                           a.  At the beginning of each school year, before the start of regular

                               their faculty to decide whether to be on full-time teaching, research
                               or extension, provided that the needs of instruction are satisfied
                               first and does not lead to extra hiring of personnel.

                               It should be noted, however, that although faculty members are

                               classified as full-time teachers, they are still required to conduct
                               either  research  or  extension  activities  on  top  of  their  teaching
                               loads. The list of those on full-time teaching shall be submitted
                               immediately to the office of the Vice President for Academic Affairs
                               (OVPAA) while those on full-time research or extension shall be
                               endorsed  by  OVPAA  to  the  Office  of  the  Vice  President  for

                               Research  and  Development.    For  efficient  allocation  of  funds,
                               tentative computation of faculty workload for instruction shall be
                               submitted to OVPAA one week, at the latest, before the start of
                               classes in each semester.


                           b.  Faculty  members  with  academic  ranks  who  opt  for  full–time

                       The maximum regular teaching load of an academic full – time teaching
                       staff  without  administrative  and  supervisory  assignment  in  any  given
                       semester  shall  be  18  teaching  hours  (TCH)  per  week.  (TCH)  and

                                  administrative assignments and other services duly supported

                               by  designations  issued  by  the  Office  of  the  President  of  the
                               University  (OUP)  as  recommended  by  the  vice  president
                               concerned.

                           b.  Faculty  members  who  opt  to  be  on  full-time  teaching  but  who
                               conduct important projects under the priority commodity thrusts of

                               the University shall earn credit units for those projects based on
                               the guidelines for research and extension workload. This credit
                               unit      shall be added to instruction workload provided that these
                               credit units are not credited on full-time research.


                           c.  The  final  report  on  faculty  workload,  including  the  summary
                               thereof, shall be submitted to the office of the Vice President for
                               Academic  Affairs  for  consolidation  within  the  final  examination
                               period of every semester.

                           d.  An academic staff who is unable to reach the maximum teaching
                               load per week shall be required to teach other courses in other

                               units  of  the  University  and/or  render  other  services  deemed
                               necessary as recommended by the Vice President for Academic

                               government personnel.  In no case, however, shall the conduct of

                               other services lead to hiring of additional part-time or full-             time
                               faculty member. Hiring will only be done when all faculty members

                           e.  In case faculty members carrying the full load of 18 TCH are given

                               extra  teaching  assignment  scheduled  outside  the  official  time,
                               such assignment shall be covered by a job order in order for the
                               faculty member to receive equitable remuneration.

                           f.  The  detailed  guidelines  for  faculty  workload  system  shall  be
                               prepared,  reviewed  and  revised  periodically  by  the  Academic

                               Council taking into account the policies listed above.

                       Article  13.  Assignment  of  Affiliate  Faculty  Members.  An  affiliate
                       faculty  member  is  one  who  has  his/her  mother  college  but  is  also
                       teaching  in  other  college(s)/campus  because  of  his/her  diversity  of
                       specialization or full knowledge of the subject(s) (BOR Res. No. 64, s,
                       2003, December 3, 2003).


                       A faculty member can get teaching load in another college(s)/ campus
                       as  long  as  he/she  is  competent  to  teach  the  proposed  subject(s)
                       because these are either in line with his/her minor field(s) or he/she has
                       undergone retooling through intensive training.

                       The  guidelines  on  assigning  of  affiliate  faculty  members  to  other

                       college(s)/ campus of the University shall be as follows:

                           a.  Arrangements  on  the  possible  teaching  load  shall  be  made

                               college/project  and  college/campus  where  a  faculty  member
                               intends  to  teach.  This  is  on  the  assumption  that  the  faculty
                               member has pre – determined the subjects he/she can possibly

                               teach in other college(s). Once the arrangement has been made,
                               an appointment of the faculty member as an affiliate of another
                               college(s) or its equivalent shall be prepared for confirmation of
                               the  faculty  member  and  for  approval  of  the  Deans/Directors
                               concerned.

                           b.  The  Department  Chair(s),  where  the  affiliate  faculty  member  is

                               assigned, shall be informed of the room assignment(s) to insure

                               is  given  teaching  load.  He/She  shall  only  report  to  the
                               college/campus during his/her scheduled classes.

                               subject(s)  being  taught  by  the  affiliate  faculty  member  shall  be

                               secured from the college/campus where the subject (s) is being
                               offered.

                           e.  An affiliate faculty member of a branch campus shall be provided
                               traveling allowance and per diem in the amount of P200.00 by the
                               campus where he is given teaching load, provided that the faculty

                               member concerned leaves his office before 12 noon.

                           f.  An affiliate faculty member shall log in and out in the department(s)
                               where she/he is assigned to teach. This will serve as a basis in the
                               giving of travel allowance if assigned in the branch campus.


                           g.  The approved class schedule shall be attached to the work load

                               where subjects are being offered.

                       the recruitment, selection, promotion, ranks, awards and resolution of
                       grievances for the members of the faculty consistent with the guidelines

                               to vacation and sick leave. However, if an employee works part-
