               research  and  shared  how  important  research  is.  Dr.  Miriam  D.  Balatazar  then  shared  a


               presentation showing and discussing the importance of journals and publishing. She shared her

               research about coffee and rice research she conducted. She also cited the differences between

               a scientific paper and scientific article. In addition, she discussed the publication process and peer

               review process, the difference between scientific journal and predator journal, the importance of

               academic  publishing,  and  the  monetary  incentive  the  researchers  get  when  publishing  their

               research.  Towards  the  end  of  her  presentation,  she  shared  her  publication  experiences,  the

               negative comments she got from editors, and the lessons she learned with these experiences.


                       The event then proceeded with the plenary session having Dr. Louziela P. Masana as the

               first speaker. Dr. Masana shared the challenges arising from the pandemic and discussed the

               research  process.  Moreover,  she  shared  the  motivations  the  faculty  members  can  have  for

               conducting a research. She kept the discussion interactive by asking the participants to answer

               her questions throughout her presentation with the use of Slido web application. Prof. Glenn Bryan
