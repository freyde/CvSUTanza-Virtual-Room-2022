                                                    Narrative Report

                             The Radicals is an Academic Organization founded for Education major
               in Mathematics students to help maintain continuous growth of the program. As their
                                                                            th
               former President, I,Marielle Sheyanne A. Penes, a BSE 4  year major in
               Mathematics, together with the former officers and the whole organization, we are
               happy to say we accomplished some of our activities and sad for not accomplishing
               some of our projects because of COVID-19 pandemic.


                             We accomplished Calculator for rent and raised fund form it. We also
               had free math tutorial for the members and other students together with the help of
               our adviser, Ms. Mildred A. Sebastian. We had our Intramurals 2019, headed by
               ACWA, Education Day, headed by CoPE, and celebrated Teacher’s Day with the
               help of the other organizations. We also had a seminar that enhanced the student’s
               knowledge in using the calculator and spreadsheet which they may use in their
               courses. And last is we participated in gift-giving, headed by CSG-Tanza, as we give
               back to our community. And because of COVID-19 pandemic, we failed to
               accomplish our plans on our Calendar of Activities such as continuation of free Math
               tutorial for the months of January to May, Math LOVE, Thanks Giving Party and
               Leadership Seminar that we planned for the months of February to May, these
               activities may be a big help for the students to enhance their knowledge and also to
               promote camaraderie of the students.

                             After all, it was still a fruitful term for us and we are all proud and happy
               to be part of this milestone. We would like to thank our former adviser and the whole
               TED Department for guiding us and the Cavite State University-Tanza Campus for
               trusting and giving us the chance to serve to serve our fellow students and the whole
               University as well.

                             I, Marielle Sheyanne A. Penes, forwarding the narrative report as an
               evidence of our accomplishments and legally leaving my position to the whole new
               set of officers. Thank you and May God bless you.
