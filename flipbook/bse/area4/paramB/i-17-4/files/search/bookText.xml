               Campus Administrator
               This Campus

               Dear Prof. Ramos,

               Greeting with Peace Sir! We would like to ask for your permission to allow us to have our Second Project
               Proposal entitled “: “SHOP YA’ LIKE” Virtual Shop Project 2021”. This project aims to build partnership
               and develop entrepreneur skills in this time. This pandemic brought so much struggles to everyone and
               one way to send help to our students is to help them in different ways. The students who needs our
               help this time are the students who are starting their small business at home and they are not quite
               familiar in marketing their products. To help them, we offer our help by creating a Virtual Shop Project
               for them. The benefits that the CSG will get in this project is that every product that we will resell, we
               can get 5.00-10.00 pesos for our fund in our future activities for our students.
               Attached here are the posters and waiver for the students who will register to this partnership project.
               We are hoping for your response regarding this matter.


               Thank you and God bless!

               Respectfully yours,

                                                ACTIVITY PROPOSAL




               I.  Title of Activity: “SHOP YA’ LIKE” Virtual Shop Project 2021

               II. Proponents: This fundraising activity involves the school community including student

               online sellers, potential customers (students of CvSU Tanza and instructors); committees
               are from the organization officers of the school.


               II.  Rationale:
                       Income- generating activities provide additional benefits that reduce poverty; improve
                   the well-being of communities; and promote empowerment, self-reliance and community

                   development (Mehra, 1997). It should be noted that income-generating activities can take
                   many forms. This is the second IGP of the CSG, this activity is conceived to be an annual
                   project or continuous if possible, this is a virtual shop and is entitled "Shop Y'a Like".  The

                   main purpose of "Shop Y'a like", is to lend a hand to the student who wants to market
                   their handmade products at home. To help the students in this time, proposing to have a
                   virtual shop to help them will be a good opportunity. It is about building partnership and

                   giving hope in different ways in this time.


               III.  Objective/s of Project:
                       This project aims to build different partnership with the students who are sellers in
                   CvSU Tanza community and the CSG Officers will help them to market their handmade

                   products to have more customers. They are the students who are not quite familiar in
                   Facebook business sites and the CSG Officers want to help them by creating a virtual

                   shop  using  Facebook  page  to  market  their  products  more.  The  Central  Student
                   Government Officers will be the one to assist the customers for explaining the details about
                   the products, and the delivery charges for it. The CSG will benefit from this project by

                   getting a 5-10 pesos in every product that the officers will be selling. This will proceed to
                   the IGP fund of the CSG to use for their future activities for the students.]]></page><page Index="12"><![CDATA[IV. Mechanics and Implementations
