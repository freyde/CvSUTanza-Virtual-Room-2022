Article 5. Student’s Participation in Co-curricular Activities.  Freedom                        of  expression  which  subsumes  free  speech,  press,  and  assembly  is  an                        inalienable and cherished right that is enshrined and guaranteed by the                        Philippine Constitution and existing laws as well as national policies and                        democratic traditions.

Freedom of expression is the mother of all human rights and for                        as  long  as  this  freedom  subsists;  violation or  vitiation of  rights  can  be                        protested  and  denounced  and thus  rights  are  protected  and  preserved.                        Freedom of expression like other human rights, however, is not absolute                        or  unbounded;  the  right  imposes  the  correlative  duty  to  exercise  it                        responsibly with due regard for the rights of others in the larger interest                        of harmony and welfare of society, and to preclude mob rule.
