For OJT, EDP, and Thesis           51   requirements, only  a  narrative  report will  be  submitted  by  the  students  as  compliance  with  the           52   requirement.           53           54      Mr. Comiso asked Prof. Sedigo if the submission of grades and portfolio is online.","55           56      Prof. Sedigo responded with Yes.           57           58      Prof. Estrada made a follow-up question to Prof. Sedigo if OJT, EDP, and Thesis narrative reports           59   will also be submitted online.           60           61      Prof. Sedigo also responded with a Yes.           62           63      Prof. Sedigo consulted, and the body agreed to have no mid-year classes for the T3 campuses this           64   2020. He said that First Semester AY 2020 would start in August, and thus faculty members without           65   designation will be reporting only in August 2020. Further, he confirmed that there is still a graduation           66   plan, and it will right after when the COVID is over.           67           68      All faculty members are required to submit the teaching portfolio containing the following to their           69   respective department chairs to avoid delay of salary: grading sheet, class record, attendance sheet,           70   teaching materials, supplemental materials, etc. The deadline for submission is on June 11, 2020.           71           72   No further matter was discussed.           73           74   The meeting adjourned at 2:30 p.m.           75           76   Prepared by:                                       Noted by:           77           78           79   JESSIE ANNE T.

Sedigo,  the  campus  coordinator,  reminded  the  campus  secretary  and  campus           40   coordinators to review the campus' Office Performance Commitment and Review (OPCR) and the T3           41   Operational Plan to be submitted to the main campus while waiting for the new format.           42           43   ACCREDITATION/APPLICATION FOR CERTIFICATE OF PROGRAM COMPLIANCE (CoPC)           44       Prof.  Sedigo  instructed  all  the  campus  coordinators  and  the  curriculum  and  instruction           45   coordinator to prepare and subject all the degree/program offerings of T3 campuses to COPC by June           46   2020. Further, he said to realign and prepare a budget of P26,000 per program for the application           47   fee. The following degree programs per campus are to be applied for COPC:  Trece: IT, HM and BM;           48   Tanza: BM, HM, IT and Educ; and Gen. Trias: Tourism, Psychology, and OFAD. He also requested Ms.           49   Feranil to prepare the Task Force Committee to prepare the documents and reminded all to be honest           50   in preparing the documents to be presented to the accreditors.           51","52       Ms. Arlene Estrada reminded all that the schedule for AACCUP accreditation would be in August           53   2020, and she likewise presented the Committee Task Force for each area.           54           55   CALENDAR OF ACTIVITIES, SECOND SEMESTER, AY 2019-2020           56       Prof. Sedigo presented the Calendar of Activities, Second Semester 2020, and reminded all to be           57   always prepared for the upcoming activities and deadlines of compliances.           58           59       Prof. Sedigo requested Prof. Feranil (Trece Campus), Prof. Sebastian (Tanza Campus) and Dr.           60   Manarpiis (Gentri Campus) to prepare the IMDU Committee Campus immediately to be submitted to           61   the Office of the University President for approval. And, they all agreed with Prof. Sedigo.           62           63       As  to  midterm  examination,  Prof.  Sedigo  reminded  all  faculty  to  prepare  and  submit  their           64   midterm examinations with TOS to their respective Department Chairs at least two weeks before the           65   scheduled exam for review and approval before reproduction.           66           67       The University Games and as well as Foundation Day are yet to be rescheduled per campus.           68   However,  for T3 campuses,  it  was agreed  to  have a  temporary  schedule  for the  foundation  day           69   celebrations and solidarity programs as follows: Trece: May 6, 2020; Tanza: May 7, 2020, and Gentri:           70   May 8, 2020.           71           72       Prof. Noel A. Sedigo calls the attention of Ms. Mary Ann L. Anonas, T3 registrar, and the rest of           73   the registrar aid to do the counterchecking of the Master List to ensure correct billing as to the           74   number of the enrolled students. Ms. Anonas said she had already done the counterchecking of the           75   master  list.  She  even  visited  the  Gen.  Trias  City  campus  to  ensure  the  records'  accuracy  to  be           76   submitted at the main campus. Likewise, all OSAS Head and CSG advisers are requested to process           77   the students' insurance as soon as possible.           78           79       Prof. Sedigo also reminded the permanent, temporary, and casual faculty and staff to submit PDS           80   and SALN to the HR Coordinator to be submitted on or before March 16, 2020, at the main campus.           81           82       As per Prof. Sedigo, Flexi-time is still up, and the use of biometrics is always encouraged. He           83   requested Dr. Demetillo to prepare a letter to ask the qualified T3 personnel to allow Flexi-time           84   because of the other designations they have. Prof. Sedigo also informed Ms. Hosmillo to request a           85   new biometric for Trece Campus since it is no longer working.           86           87       Mr. Laynes reiterated  that Gentri Campus  could hardly impose  the solid waste management           88   program since they are occupying three locations. The guards could barely monitor the students'           89   activities in disposing of their garbage.           90       Prof. Sedigo reminds Ms. Manlapig to remind the canteen owners about garbage disposal and           91   Ms. Lontoc, Mr. Cajigas, and Mr. Laynes to monitor solid waste management for each campus.           92           93       Mr. Cajigas requested for a truck and driver to pick up the chairs in Las Pinas donated by the           94   concerned foundation. Prof. Sedigo asked John to coordinated the said request to the main campus.           95           96   No further matter was discussed.           97           98   The meeting adjourned at 2:15 p.m.           99         100    Prepared by:                                       Noted by:         101         102         103    JESSIE ANNE T.
