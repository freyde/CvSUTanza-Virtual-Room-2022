               pandemic?]]></page><page Index="5"><![CDATA[6. Comments/suggestions to improve the delivery of student affairs and services during the
           pandemic

                1.  I hope all the events/activities of all organizations in CvSU - Tanza will be approve. To let the
                   students show what they've got and let the students have a little fun and take a break from a
                   stressful school works.
                2.   More webinars that focuses on the queries and needs of the students in the institution.
                3.   All students could successfully transition to online learning and access virtual services was a
                   top priority.
                4.   I would suggest that they should do a survey about what’s the important thing and something
                   they look forward to as a student so they could identify what are the things to address.

                5.  Need na magkaroon ng time to teach them skill and potential every student especially sa
                   course na pinili to help improve more skill in online class.
                6.  I overall like the delivery of student affairs and services during the pandemic, but I would like to
                   suggest prioritizing students who are less fortunate when it comes to services. Thank you po
                7.  More activity about mental health and communication with other student.
                8.  Create programs that is accessible online. Create a page where student can post
                   anonymously.
                9.  My suggestion is to have a webinars to gather the students and to motivate them.
                10. I have no suggestion because they deliver to the students very well.
                11.  Overall I dont have any suggestions because I know that they are doing there part well.
                12. For me all services are good and very helpful to all students. My suggestion is to continue and
                   create more services programs but not just for the students of Cvsu tanza but also to our great
                   professors and faculties who always there to guide us.
