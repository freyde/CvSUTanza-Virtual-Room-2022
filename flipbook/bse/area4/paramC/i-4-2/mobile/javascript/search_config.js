Since the Philippines is              most  at  risk  to  typhoons  and  other  climate  crises,  the  Circle  of  Potential  Educators  gave               information  to  the  students  of  CvSU  Tanza  regarding  how  the  students  will  maintain  the              environment  safe  and  clean.  With  the  use  of  posters  posted  on  the  official  Facebook  Page  of              Circle of Potential Educators, the students became more aware on what they should do to prevent               and to reduce the impacts of natural disasters.                     Aside  from  that,  the  poster  included  the  Republic  Act  No.  9512  or  the  “National              Environmental  Awareness  and  Education  Act  of  2008”  wherein  the  Section  5  of  RA  No.  9512               explains  that  the  month  of  November,  every  year,  shall  be  known  as  the  “Environmental              Awareness  Month”  throughout  the  Philippines.  The  poster  also  gave  insights  regarding  the              Proclamation No. 1109, s. 1997 that declares the month of November as “Clean Air Month through               National Vehicle Inspection and Maintenance Consciousness” this is to create awareness among              motorists on the importance and benefits of vehicle maintenance.","Republic of the Philippines                                            CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY                                                       Tanza Campus                                            Phase 2 Pabahay 2000 Bagtas Tanza, Cavite                                                        (046)414-3979                                                      www.cvsu.edu.ph                         18-DAY CAMPAIGN TO END VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN AND CHILDREN                                         (NOVEMBER 25 - DECEMBER 12, 2021)                                                       On November 25, 2021, the Circle of Potential Educators joined the Philippine Commission              on  Women  in  observing  the  18-Day  Campaign  to  End  Violence  against  Women  and  Children              (VAWC)  started  on  November  25,  2021  until  December  12,  2021.
