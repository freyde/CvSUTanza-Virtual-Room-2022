There are two major classifications of fund sources: the internal and                                   external  funds.  The  internal  funds  come  from  the  general  appropriation                                   allocation  (GAA)  of  the  Philippine  government.  The  Center  also  generates                                    fund from various income generating projects of the University and a portion                                   of which is allocated for the conduct of the University’s extension activities.","16                                    On the other hand, the  external  funds can come from  government  agencies                                   such as  Department  of  Agriculture  (DA), Department  of  Interior  and  Local                                    Government  (DILG),  Department  of  Agriculture  -  Agricultural  Training                                   Institute (DA-ATI),  Department  of  Agrarian  Reform  (DAR),  Department  of                                    Social Welfare and Development (DSWD), Local Government Unit (LGUs)                                   and  others  as  well  as  private  individuals  and  institutions  both  in  the                                    Philippines and abroad.                                b.  Handling of Extension Funds.  All funds of Extension Services are handled                                    by  the  Finance  Management  Office  in  coordination  with  the  Office  of  the                                   Extension  Director.  Books  of  Accounts  are  kept  by  the  Accounting                                    Department  which  is  under  the  supervision  of  the  Vice  President  for                                   Administrative and Support Services (VPASS). Personnel is assigned at the                                   Accounting  Department  to  handle  documents  of  all  extension  projects  and                                    activities of the University to expedite processing.                                           External  grants  are  treated  as  trust  funds.  Funds  are  released  to  the                                    Accounting  Department  by  project  allotment  whereby  project/study  leaders                                   handle the processing of papers to release the fund meant for their extension                                    projects/studies in coordination with the Extension Services Director. Funds                                   allocated  from  the  income  generating  projects  are  also  handled  by  the                                    Accounting Department and managed by the Extension Services Director.                                c.  Management of Extension Services Funds.  Extension Services funds shall                                    be reported in terms of obligation or liquidation. The Accounting Department                                   monitors the expenditures in accordance with the items in the budget and sub-","17                                    allotment.  Payrolls,  vouchers,  request  for  supplies  and  materials  and  other                                   obligation of the projects  shall  be paid through the Accounting Department                                    with  approval  from  the  Vice  President  for  Administrative  and  Support                                   Services following the accounting and auditing rules and regulations.                                            As  with  any  government  agency,  expenditures  incurred  in  the                                   implementation of research and extension programs in State Universities and                                    Colleges (SUCs) shall be subjected to auditing procedures prescribed by the                                   COA.  The  internal  audit  which  is  under  the  supervision  of  the  Office  of                                    University  President  and  a  representative  from  COA  shall  conduct  the                                   auditing.

Extension Grant Opportunities                                    Section 1.1. CvSU  Extension Grant.   Cavite  State  University  (CvSU) has                                   trilogy  of  functions  –  instruction,  research,  and  extension.  All  the  three                                   functions of the University stand in a tripod in order to attain its mission of                                    educating future leaders, expanding knowledge, and developing technological                                   innovations and provide services to the community.                                            Extension is very significant in the promotion of research outputs for                                   national  development.  Without  extension,  information  and  technologies                                    developed  and  produced  by  the  University  would  not  be  able  to  reach  its                                   target beneficiaries.","18                                            Recently,  the  Commission  on  Higher  Education  (CHED)  is                                   strengthening  the  extension  function  of  the  Higher  Education  Institutions                                    (HEIs).  In  fact,  the  Commission  has  Grant-In-Aids  (GIA)  for  extension                                   programs  and  projects.  Aside  from  CHED,  other  institutions  such  as                                    Department  of  Science  and  Technology  (DOST)  and  Department  of                                   Agriculture (DA) provide grants for extension.                                            To  better  reinforce  the  extension  function  of  the  University,  the                                   creation of the CvSU Extension Grant is proposed. The grant aims to produce                                    high quality and relevant extension projects for the promotion of community                                   development.                                            The  CvSU  Extension  Grant  shall  give  priority  to  extension  projects                                   which are: aligned with the University Research and Extension Agenda; based                                   on  the  needs  of  the  community;  utilize  University  research  outputs;                                    multidisciplinary; and apply appropriate extension approaches, strategies and                                   methods.                                        Section 1.1.1. Objectives of the CvSU Extension Grant                                       1.  To  promote  and  encourage  faculty  and  staff  to  conduct  relevant                                            extension  activities  and/or  public  service  work  in  line  with                                           institutional, regional, national, and global thrusts;                                        2.  To  provide  financial  support  for  extension  projects  that  receive                                           minimal funds; and                                        3.  To strengthen the extension function of the University.","19                                        Section  1.1.2.  Amount  of  Grant.    A  maximum  of  P200,000.00  grant                                       money per proponent shall be awarded for a one-year extension project.                                        Once  all  legal  and  documentary  requirements  have  been  accomplished,                                       70% of the total amount of grant shall be released to the proponent.

It means that                                        the  project  had  undergone  and  passed  on-site  monitoring,  semi-annual                                       review, and financial monitoring.                                               In the case of multi-year projects (with duration of more than one                                       year), release of grant money shall be on an annual basis and shall depend                                        on its yearly budgetary requirement. Funds for the succeeding year/s shall                                       only be released after the Monitoring and Evaluation Division had issued                                       Certificate of Acceptability.

As mandated, the University shall “provide                advanced instruction and professional training in agriculture, science and technology,                education  and  other  related  fields,  undertake  research  and  extension  services,  and                provide progressive leadership in these areas.” (Republic Act No. 8468, converting the                Don  Severino  Agricultural  College  into  University  Status,  to  be  called  Cavite  State                University).                         Republic act 8435, or the Agriculture and Fisheries  Modernization Act of                1997 (AFMA) under section 86 stated that: “It is hereby declared the policy of the state                to promote science and technology, as essential for national development and progress.                The State shall give priority to the utilization of research results through formal and non-                formal education, extension and training services.”                         Historical  Background  –  For  decades,  the  University  has  been  involved  in                community  outreach  and  extension  activities.  When  .this  was  converted  into  Don                Severino Agricultural College (DSAC) in 1964, extension became one of the functions of                this institution, in addition to instruction and research. DSAC started with two major                units,  the  Secondary  Department  and  the  College  Department.  The  latter  conducted                extension services in the form of seminars on improved farm practices and certified seeds                and  veterinary  services  to  the  animals  of  the  service  area.  In  addition,  the  College                maintained a one-and-a-half hectare nursery for the propagation of and multiplication of                important plants for on-campus and for farmers’ use. The Swine Project which was used                for  instruction  purposes  also  served  as  source  of  foundation  stock  for  farmers.  Boar                services were made available to small hog raisers for the improvement of their stock                (DSAC Annual Report, SY 1968-69).                         Since  then,  the  milestones  of  extension  services  were  recorded  in  the  Annual                Reports of this educational institution.","Article 1.

UGNAYAN: A Unified Community-Based Project                         Section 1.    Ugnayan  is  a  Tagalog  word  which  connotes  linkages  and                                      coordination among the stakeholders. The University selected an                                      UGNAYAN barangay or village where the extension services of the                                      different colleges are focused.                                              UGNAYAN is a unified extension and research program for                                      the academic units of Cavite State University. Ugnayan is a Tagalog                                      word  which  connotes  coordination  and  cooperation.  While  this                                      program was approved by the Board of Regents (BOR No. 55) on 6                                      December 2001, the practice dates back in the late 70’s as Project                                      UGNAYAN.                                              Originally, its philosophy stated that “it is an approach  to                                      rural development where the spirit of coordination among those                                      concerned in the upliftment of a community is given importance.                                      From a singly focused agricultural extension project, the project, the                                      project evolved into a unified extension and research program.                                              This  approach  allows  each  major  academic  unit  of  the                                      University  to  pursue  community  service  projects  and  applied                                      research in a beneficiary barangay that is adopted as pilot area by                                       the University. The problem to be solved should be within the area                                      expertise of the College concerned. Each College establishes its own                                      Project  Implementation  Unit  (PIU)  with  a  Central  Project                                      Implementation Unit (CPIU) at the office of the Vice President for                                      Academic Affairs and coordinated by OVP RECETS.                                             At present, the adopted barangay is Banaba Lejos, Indang,                                       Cavite.

Headed by the Vice President, The                                          RDE  spearheads  the  formulation  of  the  RDEAP  through  a                                          workshop. Participants in this planning workshop are the Deans                                          of  the  different  Colleges  and  branch  campuses  together  with                                          their  respective  Research,  Development  and  Extension  (RDE)                                          Coordinators.                                       b.  During  the  University  planning  workshop,  the  thrusts  of  the                                          University  are  reviewed  and  revised.  In  this  process,                                          identification and selection of research and extension thrusts                                          are  guided  by  the  stated  vision  and  mission  of  the                                          university/college/campus.      Likewise,     the    Millennium                                          Development Goals (MDGs), national and provincial, municipal                                           and local development goals are considered.                                       c.  The  research,  development  and  extension  (RDE)  thrusts                                          resulting  from  the  latest  (2004)  RDEAP  planning  workshops                                          include: poverty alleviation, food security, primary health care","and  public  health,  alternative  medicine,  cultural  heritage                                          preservation, ecosystem management, energy conservation and                                          utilization,  institutional  capability  building,  information  and                                          communication technology, infrastructure planning and design,                                          bio-technology,  industrial  technology,  pedagogy/andragogy,                                          gender  and  development,  coffee,  pineapple,  banana,  kaong,                                          makapuno,herbs  and  spices,  ornamentals,  and  urban                                          agriculture.                          Section 3.     Presentation of RDEAP by College                                       a.  Prior to the actual conduct of RDEAP planning workshop, the                                          RDE Coordinators present their draft plans with their respective                                          Deans  for  further  comments  and  suggestions.  During  the                                          workshop, the RDE Coordinators polish their prepared Agenda.                                          As  part  of  the  workshop,  the  RDEAP  of  the  different                                          Colleges/Campuses  are  presented  to  the  RECETS  Council  for                                          comments and suggestions.                                              Also,  during  the  presentation  of  various  agenda  and                                          programs  by  College/Campus,  duplication  of  plans  and                                          programs  are  eliminated.  In  cases  where  similar  areas  of                                          concerns  are  presented  by  two  or  more  Colleges,  either  one                                          party will drop its proposed knowledge area or integrate such                                          with the others of similar nature. Also, group members openly                                          discuss and decide as to who would lead the implementation of                                           such programs.                                       b.

Section 4.    Presentation of RDEAP by College                                       ▪  Call for capsule proposals. Office of the Director for Extension                                          calls for the submission of an extension proposal. Although the                                          extension  has  its  own  format,  format  shall  be  based  on  the                                          requirement of the funding agency and in case that the fund shall                                          come  from  the  university,  the  proposal  should  follow  the                                          extension format.                                       ▪  College/Campuses  prepare  capsule  proposals.  Faculty                                          members  of  the  different  colleges  with  varied  fields  of                                           specialization  prepare  capsule  proposal  on  their  areas  of                                          expertise and interest. The proposal maybe singly prepared or                                          in  cooperation  (interdisciplinary  approach)  with  other                                          extensionists.  The  proposals  are  in  line  with  the  approved                                          RDEAP. Capsule proposals are reviewed at the department level                                          to the college levels by the respective research and extension                                          committee in coordination with RDE Coordinator.                                       ▪  Deans endorse capsule proposals to URDE Council through                                          the  Extension  Director.  The  reviewed  proposals  are  then                                          endorsed to the URDEC through the Director for approval.                                       ▪  URDEC reviews and approves the capsule proposals. All the                                          extension  proposals  must  be  reviewed  and  approved  by  the                                          URDEC prior to their implementation.                                       ▪  URDEC endorses the approved proposals for University or                                           external  funding.  Proposals  requiring  bigger  funding  are                                          usually  submitted  to  external  funding  institution  while  the                                          remaining projects are recommended for local funding.                                       ▪  Extension Director prepares work and financial plans for                                           approved  projects.  Extension  Director  considers  the  newly","approved proposals in the preparation of their annual work and                                          financial plan.                          Section 5.    Implementation of Approved Projects                                       a.)  Proponents implement their approved projects following                                          their    scheduled     activities.   Program/project     leaders                                          implement  their  approved  projects  at  their  respective                                          colleges/campuses  in  coordination  with  RECETS.  While  the                                          University  has  RECETS  that  is  in-charge  of  the  research  and                                          extension  functions,  the  planning  and  implementation  of                                          research and extension projects is decentralized but unified up                                          to  the  department  level.  This  approach  has  been                                          institutionalized and exemplified in CvSU through the concept                                          called UGNAYAN.                  Article 11. Monitoring and Evaluation                         Monitoring  continuously  tracks  performance  against  what  was  planned  by                collecting and analyzing data on the indicators established for monitoring and evaluation                purposes. It provides continuous information on whether progress is being made toward                achieving  results  (outputs,  outcomes  and  goals)  through  record  keeping  and  regular                reporting  systems.  Monitoring  looks  at  both  programmed  processes  and  changes  in                conditions of target groups and institutions brought about by programmed activities. It                also identifies strengths and weaknesses in a programmed. The performance information                generated from monitoring enhances learning from experience and improves decision-                making. Management and programmed implementers typically conduct monitoring.                         Evaluation is a periodic, in-depth analysis of programmed performance. In relies                on data generated through monitoring activities as well as information obtained from                other  sources  (e.g.,  studies,  research,  in-depth  interviews,  focus  group  discussions,                surveys etc.). Evaluations are often (but not always) conducted with the assistance of                external evaluators (UNFPA, 2004).                            Section 1.    Monitoring Strategies                         a.  Mechanisms and Processes                           1.  Creation of the University Research, Development and Extension                               Council (URDEC)                                      The Council is composed of the Research and Extension Directors                               and selected faculty members who are considered experts in their                               respective fields. The Vice President for Research Development and","Extension chair this council. The University President designates the                               members of the URDEC.                                      The Council primarily reviews research and extension policies,                               guidelines, programs and projects. In relation to monitoring and                               evaluation, the group acts as Panel of Reviewers during the Extension                               Agency In-House Review. They review and evaluate various on-going and                               completed extension programs/projects and activities of the different                               colleges and branch campuses.                            2.

The Director of Extension services coordinates and monitors the                               extension activities of the different colleges primarily through meetings                               with the different Research, Development and Extension (RD E)                               Coordinators.                            5.  Field Visits – All faculty members and staff engaged in extension activities                               are conducting regular field’s visits to their respective service areas. In the                               UGNAYAN  service  area  of  the  CvSU  main  campus,  the  RD  and  E                               Coordinators either go in group or individually.                            6.  Accomplishment Reports – The Extension Services regularly submits                               monthly, weekly and daily accomplishment reports to the concerned                               offices. At the end of the year, a Performance Accomplishment Report                               (PAR) is submitted to the Office of the President through the RECETS                               office. This PAR compares the year accomplishments vis-à-vis targeted                               activities.                            7.  Telephone calls – The presence of modern technologies like the cell                               phones make it easy to contact and collect information and updates from                               RD and E Coordinators, faculty extentionists and clients.","8.  Memorandum and Other Written Communication – The Conventional                               methods of monitoring projects are through memoranda and other                               written communication, e.g. letters.                                a.  Monitoring Reports and Other Forms                                      To effectively monitor planned and on-going extension projects and                                  resources of Extension Services, the following forms shall be used:                                          ▪  Daily Performance Report                                          ▪  Activities/Projects Progress Report (Weekly/Monthly)                                          ▪  Monthly Expenditure and Income of Projects/Services                                          ▪  Student Loan Fund                                          ▪  Loan and Payment Status (Semestral)                                          ▪  Form  to  Monitor  Number  of  Visitors  Served  and                                             Accommodated                         Section 2.    Evaluation Strategies                         a.) Mechanisms and Processes                               The  University  has  established  mechanisms  and  processes  by  which                           regular  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  extension  services  and  resources  are                           ensured. As mentioned earlier, these include designation of RDE Council and                           RDE Coordinators; and the conduct of yearly in-house review.                                The Extension Services has just introduced the logical framework approach                           (LFA) or concept in the evaluation of extension programs and projects. It has                           adopted the use of Logical Framework Model (Appendix 2) in the presentation                           of papers during the In-House Review. This model is able to represent the                           different types of evaluation.                         b.) Types of Evaluation                                   There are different kinds of approaches to evaluation, based on when it                           occurs (process vs. outcome), the intentions of the evaluator (formative vs.                           summative), and who does the evaluation (internal vs. external).                                   Evaluations  maybe  conducted  at  any  of  several  phases  of  program                           development and implementation. Process and outcome evaluations relate to                           the phase of the program studied. Process evaluations examine what goes on                           inside the program while it is in progress, focusing on such things as activities                           offered, staff practices, and client actions. Evaluating program processes may                           be very helpful in understanding why program objectives are or are not met.                           Outcome evaluations put emphasis on the program objectives or outcomes:                           what happens to clients as a result of their participation in the program. The                           processes and outcome evaluations may either be formative or summative,                           depending on the intentions of the evaluator (or those who hire the evaluator).","Program sponsors and taxpayers typically are interested in program                           accountability, which calls for summative evaluation. Summative evaluation                           helps to answer the question, “Is the program earning its keep?” and provides                           information  which  can  be  used  to  help  program  sponsors  make  informed                           decisions about program funding. In comparison, a person who implement                           programs  are  often  more  interested  in  learning  how  to  improve  their                           programs.  Program  improvement  is  the  purpose  of  formative  evaluation.                           When an organization has an evaluator or evaluation team on staff to evaluate                           their  own  programs,  this  is  considered  internal  evaluation.  External                           evaluations are conducted by outside by outside evaluation organizations or                           independent evaluators (PREL).                                   With the use of Logical Framework Approach in the In-House Review,                           CvSU  Extension  Services  performs  process  and  outcome  evaluations,                           formative and summative evaluations (ongoing and completed projects) and                           considered internal and external evaluator as stated in the approved proposal                         c.) Reports and Other Forms                                Extension  evaluation  takes  place  in  all  stages:  the  planning,                           implementation and after implementation phase of a program/project.                                   ▪  Interview schedules and questionnaires  – are frequently used on                                      these activities in the conduct of Benchmark Survey and Training                                      Needs  Assessments  (TNA)  and  in  the  evaluation  of  ongoing                                      extension activities.                                  ▪  CEAAIREV Format for Writing Extension Report – for on-going and                                      completed extension activities.                                  ▪  CEAAIREV Abstract (For Paper and Poster Presentation)                                  ▪  CEAIREV  Format  for  PowerPoint  Presentation  –  for  reporting                                      extension activities.                                  ▪  Poster  Presentation  –  for  on-going  and  completed  extension                                      activities.                                  ▪  CEAIREV  Criteria  for  Paper  Presentation  –  for  on-going  and                                      completed extension activities.                                  ▪  CEAIREV  Criteria  for  Poster  Presentation  –  for  on-going  and                                      completed extension activities.                                  ▪  Logical  Framework  Model  –  for  planning,  monitoring  and                                      evaluation of extension programs, projects and activities.                                  ▪  Annual Performance Target and Accomplishment                                  ▪  Annual Report","Article 12.

Section 3. Finance                         a.  Sources of Funds. Financial resources are generated through grants, donations,                            bilateral  agreements  and  collaborations  with  government  and  nongovernment","agencies private institutions, foreign funding institutions and other agencies and                            councils.                                   There are two major classifications of fund sources: the internal and external                            funds. The internal funds come from the general appropriation allocation (GAA) of                           the Philippine government. The Center also generates fund from various income                            generating projects of the University and a portion of which is allocated for the                            conduct of the University’s extension activities.

Funds                            allocated from the income generating projects are also handled by the Accounting                           Department and managed by the Extension Services Director.                          c.  Management of Extension Services Funds.  Extension Services funds shall be                           reported in terms of obligation or liquidation.

Extension Grant Opportunities                                 Section  1.1.  CvSU  Extension  Grant.  Cavite  State  University  (CvSU)  has                        trilogy of functions – instruction, research, and extension. All the three functions of the                         University stand in a tripod in order to attain its mission of educating future leaders,                        expanding knowledge, and developing technological innovations and provide services                         to the community.                                 Extension is very significant in the promotion of research outputs for national                        development.  Without  extension,  information  and  technologies  developed  and                         produced by the University would not be able to reach its target beneficiaries.                                 Recently, the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) is strengthening the                        extension function of the Higher Education Institutions (HEIs). In fact, the Commission                         has Grant-In-Aids (GIA) for extension programs and projects. Aside from CHED, other                        institutions such as Department of Science and Technology (DOST) and Department                         of Agriculture (DA) provide grants for extension.
