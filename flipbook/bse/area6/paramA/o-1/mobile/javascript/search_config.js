Rationale                               The population explosion in Brgy. Bagtas has led to an initiative to alleviate                         poverty in the barangay. Brgy. Bagtas, having the most population in Tanza (20,370                         out of 188,755), has been the site for relocation and reclamation. However, people,                         who were displaced out of their previous addresses, were relocated in the said barangay                         without having a regular source of living. Some of them could not find a decent job                         because they lack the educational and other requirements for the job that they were                         applying  for.  Others  could  not  start  any  business  because  they  lack  the  skills  in","preparing innovative products that could help them earn additional income for their                         families.                                Thus, different extension activities are being proposed to increase the quality of                         life of the citizens in the said barangay. Non-formal education will help out-of-school                         children to be able to read, write and count. Also, livelihood programs are deemed to                         strengthen housewives’ skills and at the same time, augment the meager income of                         their families. In addition, awareness drives concerning health and other GAD-related                         issues are being proposed to inculcate the importance of appropriate living conditions                         for every member of the community.                      III.   Strategies of Implementation                           A.  Formation of Committee                                       A committee was formed to study and gather benchmark information                               on the status, needs, and conditions of selected communities in Tanza, Cavite                               during the second semester, AY 2014 – 2015. The committee was headed by                               the  Extension  Coordinator.  Two  faculty  members  from  the  different                               departments of the campus were selected as members of the committee to                               ensure that the programs will conform to the mandate of the university. The                               committee  used  the  following  benchmark  information,  provided  by  Tanza                               Municipal Planning and Development Office (TMPDO), in order to assess                               which group of individuals will be the target beneficiaries of the proposal.

Data utilized in                               the  study  mainly  came  from  the  responses  on  the  self-administered  survey                               questions that were distributed to the residents of Brgy. Bagtas. Residents were                               selected using simple random sampling.                                Results revealed that:                                       •  87.14% of the residents perceived that they lack regular sources of                                          living  in  the  barangay  because  most  (48.15%)  of  them  lack  the                                          educational  requirements  and  some  (38.99%)  lack  the  technical","skills to either start a small business or to apply for a regular job;                                      •  47.06% of the residents believed that these problems and issues may                                          be  addressed  through  conduct  of  free  seminars/trainings  on                                          livelihood programs;                                        •  47.06% of the residents believed that these problems and issues may                                          be  addressed  through  conduct  of  free  seminars/trainings  on                                          livelihood programs;                                       •  47.06% of the residents believed that these problems and issues may                                          be  addressed  through  conduct  of  free  seminars/trainings  on                                          livelihood programs;                            B.  Preparation of Committee                                      The  proposal  to  conduct  extension  programs  in  the  community  was                               based upon the respondent’s needs and interests that are consistent with the                               goals of the campus and that have been identified through surveys.                                      Some programs relative to the needs and interests of the residents were                               not  considered  due  to  insufficiencies  on  facilities  and  absence  of  qualified                               faculty members to handle such programs. This includes recycling of plastic                               products, water lily bags, and perfume-making which may require raw materials                               that are unavailable from the community.                                      While having consultative meetings with the local government of the                               concerned  barangay,  some  requests  to  the  university  were  raised.  First,  the                               campus  will  have  to  offer  a  computer  literacy  program  for  their  barangay                               officials and 4P’s members. This program aims to extend computer literacy to                               the Brgy. Officials and selected 4P’s members, who, based on observation, lack                               sufficient skills in computer manipulation and processes. The LGU believes that                               technical  skills  must  be  manifested  by  their  officials  to  better  serve  their                               constituents  and  for  those  4P’s  members  for  employment  and  business                               opportunities.                                       Also,  the  LGU  requested  that  the  proponents  offer  literacy  skills                               development among their children. According to them, a number of children                               were not enrolled in a formal school and parents of these children affirm that                               they could not send them to formal school due to lack of financial resources,                               that although education is free in public schools, they could not provide the                               requirements that their children must submit.                                        Another  request  from  the  LGU  is  that  the  proponent  should  give                               awareness campaigns on different health issues. According to them, the increase                               in the rate of patients with dengue and AIDS/HIV in the province had been                               alarming them and the residents.

Ms. Ma. Kathleena Rose J. Arca, the SK Chairperson of Barangay                 Bagtas asked the campus to become one of the ALS providers in Bagtas through its                program  Oplan  Karunungan.  She  believed  that  the  campus  is  really  suitable  for                 providing quality instruction to ALS students. The campus is very glad to provide help                 to  the  barangay  particularly  in  increasing  numeracy  and  literacy  in  the  adopted                community.  The  campus  immediately  coordinated  to  the  representative  of  Dep-Ed                 ALS  in  Bagtas  about  the  MOA  and  schedules  of  classes.  The  Campus  and                representative of Dep-Ed ALS agreed to each terms and conditions and set the date                 when to start the classes for the new ALS students.                          Before the start of the classes, the campus also posted announcements on its                Facebook page to increase the number of ALS enrollees. During the orientation, 29                 ALS enrollees attended the orientation. These 29 enrollees are composed of out-of-                 school youths and adults who wished to finish their secondary education. The ALS                orientation  was  attended  by  the  faculty  members  of  the  campus,  Dep-Ed  ALS                 representative and the barangay chairperson and his staff.                          During the first class of ALS students, Ms. Mildred A. Sebastian, chairperson of                 TED, served as the lecturer for Mathematics lesson and digital literacy at the same                time. Other faculty members served as the lecturers in the succeeding days of ALS                 classes. Ms. Charmaine T. Banag served as the lecturer for Digital Literacy. Dr. Noel","B.  Manarpiis  served  as  the  lecturer  for  English  and  Communication  subjects.  Mr.                 Melandro F. Soriano, pre-service teacher, served as the Science teacher.                          During the two weeks of ALS classes, it was observed that the ALS students                really enjoyed the classes based on the feedback evaluation given to them after every                 class. According to one of the students, he was amazed on how the teachers teach                 the lessons and their approaches to them. He had stopped because his high school                teachers  reprimanded  him  inside  the  class  that  led  him  to  traumatic  experience.                 Because of that, he refused to go to school and worked in a construction firm instead.                But now, his perspective in life had changed because of the treatment of the faculty                 members  they  received.  It  is  good  to  know  that  his  program  really  changes  the                perspective of these former out-of-school youths.                          The ALS students also experienced how to use computer through their digital                 literacy subject. They were also taught how to express themselves as some of them                 have very low self-esteem due to their level of education. Dr. Manarpiis taught them                some tips on how to become a confident English language speaker.                          The Extension Services Unit of the campus will ensure that they will provide the                 needs of the students in order for them to receive the quality of education they deserve.
