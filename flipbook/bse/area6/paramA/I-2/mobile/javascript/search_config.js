Rationale       :                           The population explosion in Brgy. Bagtas has led to an initiative to alleviate poverty in the                   barangay.  Brgy. Bagtas, having the most number of populations in Tanza (20,370 out of 188,755),                   has been the site for relocation and reclamation.  However, people, who were displaced out of their                   previous addresses, were relocated in the said barangay without having a regular source of living.                   Some of them could not find a decent job because they lack the educational and other requirements                   for the job that they were applying for. Others could not start any business because they lack the","skills  in  preparing  innovative  products  that  could  help  them  earn  additional  income  for  their                   families.                           Thus, different extension activities are being proposed to increase the quality of life of the                   citizens in the said barangay. Non-formal education will help out-of-school children to be able to                   read, write and count. Also, livelihood programs deemed to strengthen housewives skills and at                   the  same  time,  augment  the  meager  income  of  their  families.  In  addition,  awareness  drives                   concerning health and other GAD-related issues are being proposed to inculcate the importance of                   appropriate living condition for every member of the community.               III.  Strategies of Implementation                    A.  Formation of Committee                              A committee was formed to study and gather benchmark information on the status,                       needs, and conditions of selected communities in Tanza, Cavite during the second semester,                       AY  2014  –  2015.  The  committee  was  headed  by the  Extension  Coordinator.  Two  faculty                       members  from  the  different  departments  of  the  campus  were  selected  as  members  of  the                       committee to ensure that the programs will conform to the mandate of the university. The                       committee used the following benchmark information, provided by Tanza Municipal Planning                       and Development Office (TMPDO), in order to assess which group of individuals will be the                       target beneficiaries of the proposal.

Data utilized in the study mainly                       came from the responses on the self-administered survey questions that were distributed to the                       residents of Brgy. Bagtas.  Residents were selected using simple random sampling.                               Results revealed that:                                  •  87.14% of the residents perceived that they lack regular sources of living in the                                     barangay because most (48.15%) of them lack the educational requirements and                                     some (38.99%) lack the technical skills to either start a small business or to                                     apply for a regular job;","•  47.06%  of  the  residents  believed  that  these  problems  and  issues  may  be                                     addressed through conduct of free seminars/trainings on livelihood programs;                                  •  18.33% of the residents suggested to conduct free seminar on candle making;                                     17.33% suggested soap making; 15.33% suggested delicacy preparation such as                                     yema, ube, leche flan, puto, and others; 13.67% suggested dishwashing liquid                                     making; 13.00% suggested recycling of plastic products and water lily bags;                                     while the remaining 8.67% suggested perfume-making;                                  •  46.50% of the residents said that they have baking and cooking skills and they                                     are willing to undergo trainings for delicacy preparation; also 22.50% reiterated                                     that they have the skills in the arts and trades and that they are willing to undergo                                     trainings  on  preparation  of  innovative  products  such  as  candle,  soap,  and                                     dishwashing liquid;                     B.  Preparation of Proposal                              The proposal to conduct extension programs in the community was based upon the                       respondent’s needs and interests that are consistent with the goals of the campus and that have                       been identified through surveys.                               Some programs relative to the needs and interests of the residents were not considered                       due to insufficiencies on facilities and absence of qualified faculty members to handle such                       programs. This includes recycling of plastic products, water lily bags, and perfume-making                       which may require raw materials that are unavailable from the community.                               While  having  consultative  meetings  with  the  local  government  of  the  concerned                       barangay, some requests to the university were raised. First, the campus will have to offer                       computer literacy program for their barangay officials and 4P’s members. This program aims                       to extend computer literacy to the Brgy. Officials and selected 4P’s members, who, based on                       observation, lack with sufficient skills in computer manipulation and processes. The LGU                       believes  that  technical  skills  must  be  manifested  by  their  officials  to  better  serve  their                       constituents and for those 4P’s members for employment and business opportunities.                               Also, the LGU requested that the proponents offer literacy skills development among                       their children. According to them, a number of children were not enrolled in a formal school                       and parents of these children affirm that they could not send them in formal school due to lack                       of financial resources, that although education is free in public schools, they could not provide                       the requirements that their children must submit.                               Another request from the LGU is that the proponent should give awareness campaigns                       on different health issues. According to them, the increase in the rate of patients with dengue                       and AIDS/HIV in the province had been alarming them and the residents. And because the                       proponent  is  a  GAD  advocate,  GAD-related  issues  and  concerns  were  included  in  this                       awareness campaign, such as Anti-Violence against Women and their Children (anti-VAWC),                       sexual harassment among others.","C.  Meeting of the Committee                              A meeting of the campus Committee on Curriculum and Instruction was conducted on                       April 10, 2015 to deliberate on the proposed extension programs in the campus.                               The following is the decision of the members of the committee:                                         Total Number of Committee Members              :      15                                          Total Number of Committee Members who                                                were present                            :      15                                          Total Number of Committee Members who                                                were absent                             :      0                                          Number of Members in favor of the                                                proposal                                :      15                                          Number of Members not in favor of the                                                proposal                                :      0                                With this result, the following resolutions were passed by the Committee:                               Resolution No. 3, s. 2015                                      “Approving the extension project proposal to alleviate poverty in Barangay                              Bagtas with the following components: (1) Oplan Karunungan; (2) Computer Literacy                              for Brgy.
