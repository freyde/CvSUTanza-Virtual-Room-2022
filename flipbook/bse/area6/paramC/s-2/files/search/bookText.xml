                                     IN BARANGAY BAGTAS, TANZA, CAVITE


                       The population explosion in Brgy. Bagtas has led to an initiative to alleviate

               poverty  in  the  barangay.  Brgy.  Bagtas,  having  the  most  number  of  populations  in

               Tanza  (20,370  out  of  188,755),  has  been  the  site  for  relocation  and  reclamation.
               However, people, who were displaced out of their previous addresses, were relocated

               in the said barangay without having a regular source of living. Some of them could not
               find a decent job because they lack the educational and other requirements for the job

               that they were applying for. Others could not start any business because they lack the
               skills in preparing innovative products that could help them earn additional income for

               their families.

                       Thus,  Cavite  State  University  –  Tanza  Campus  shall  launch  a  full-blown
               extension program through the Research and Extension Office. The campus extension

               program shall be called as “BAGTAS with CvSU – Tanza (Bagtas ay Aasenso at
               Giginhawa kung Tayo Ay Sama-sama with CvSU – Tanza)”. The main goal of the

               program is to increase the quality of life of the citizens in the said barangay.

                       For  this  reason,  it  is  essential  to  conduct  a  Community  Needs  Assessment
               (CNA) aiming to identify the needs in order to provide appropriate services to those

               needs.  CNA  will  provide  database  information  on  the  current  status  of  each
               community.  The  study  will  also  be  able  to  provide  a  framework  for  identifying

               appropriate  community,  profiling  of  their  needs,  and  provide  sustainable  extension

               program to meet specific needs.
                       Cavite State University – Tanza Campus is located in Tanza, Cavite so, the

               extension  unit  has  chosen  one  of  the  barangays  in  Tanza  to  be  adopted  for  its
               extension activities. It adopted barangay Bagtas since this is the barangay that has

               the most number of populations in the Municipality of Tanza.]]></page><page Index="3"><![CDATA[Results and Quantitative Summary of Community Needs Assessment

                       A committee was formed to study and gather benchmark information on the
               status, needs, and conditions of selected communities in Tanza, Cavite during the

               second  semester,  AY  2014  –  2015.  The  committee  was  headed  by  the  Extension
               Coordinator. Two faculty members from the different departments of the campus were

               selected as members of the committee to ensure that the programs will conform to the

               mandate of the university. The committee used the following benchmark information,
               provided by Tanza Municipal Planning and Development Office (TMPDO), in order to

               assess which group of individuals will be the target beneficiaries of the proposal.

                       The committee used the descriptive design of a study. Data utilized in the study
               mainly came from the responses on the self-administered survey questions that were

               distributed to the residents of Brgy. Bagtas. Residents were selected using simple
               random sampling.

                              in the barangay because most (48.15%) of them lack the educational
                              requirements and some (38.99%) lack the technical skills to either start
                              a small business or to apply for a regular job;


                          •  47.06% of the residents believed that these problems and issues may
                              be addressed through conduct of free seminars/trainings on livelihood

                         NARRATIVE REPORT ON COMMUNITY NEEDS ASSESSMENT


                       Cavite  State  University  –  Tanza  Campus  conducted  a  community  needs

               assessment in Barangay Bagtas, Tanza, Cavite on January 30-31 and February 7,


               2015. The activity was headed by the campus extension coordinator, Ms. Mildred A.

               Sebastian. The officers and members of different student organization such as CSG,


               FAME, COPE and CSS, assisted in conducting interviews among the residents of the

               community. The event was also participated by the other faculty members and key


               officials of the campus.

                       The  needs  assessment  was  done  to  address  the  needs,  problems  or  gaps

               between current conditions and desired conditions of the community. This also helps


               to identify the strengths and resources available in the community to meet the needs

               of the children, youth and families. This assessment pays particular attention to the


               capabilities of the community, including its citizens, agencies, and local organizations.


                       Prior  to  the  needs  assessment,  the  extension  coordinator  talked  to  the


               barangay captain over the phone, to offer an extension project that can cater the needs

               of the community. The barangay captain was overwhelmed to hear that the campus


               will help them to alleviate poverty in the barangay through this extension project. He

               also  said  that  he  is  really  willing  to  provide  any  assistance  for  the  success  of  the

               project.]]></page><page Index="8"><![CDATA[As the interview and needs assessment started, one of the barangay staff also

               accompanied  the  group  in  going  to  the  houses  of  the  residents.  Prepared


               questionnaires were used during the interview. The assessment went well because

               the interviewees were very cooperative. It was indeed a productive day for the group.



                       Certificate of appearance which was duly signed by the barangay captain was

               issued to the interviewers.
