                        Title        :      BAGTAS with CvSU-Tanza

                        Location     :      Brgy. Bagtas, Tanza, Cavite

                        Proponent  :        Cavite State University – Tanza Campus

                        Beneficiaries:      Out-of-school  Children  and  Youth,  Brgy.  Officials,  and  non-
                                            working members of the community

                        Project Components:

                               Program 1: Oplan Karunungan
                               Program 2: Computer Literacy Program

                               Program 4: Health and Wellness


                       Partner Agencies:  Local Government Unit of the Municipality of Tanza, Cavite;
                                            Provincial Cooperative, Livelihood, and Entrepreneurial
                                            Development Office (PCLEDO); Farmers Training Center
                                            (FITS); Companies in Export Processing Zone Authority
                                            (EPZA)


                       Estimated Budget:   Php 610,000

                       Duration      :      5 years


                   II.    Rationale
                              The population explosion in Brgy. Bagtas has led to an initiative to alleviate
                        poverty in the barangay. Brgy. Bagtas, having the most population in Tanza (20,370
                        out of 188,755), has been the site for relocation and reclamation. However, people,
                        who were displaced out of their previous addresses, were relocated in the said barangay]]></page><page Index="8"><![CDATA[without having a regular source of living. Some of them could not find a decent job
                        because they lack the educational and other requirements for the job that they were
                        applying  for.  Others  could  not  start  any  business  because  they  lack  the  skills  in
                        preparing innovative products that could help them earn additional income for their
                        families.

                              Thus, different extension activities are being proposed to increase the quality of
                        life of the citizens in the said barangay. Non-formal education will help out-of-school
                        children to be able to read, write and count. Also, livelihood programs are deemed to
                        strengthen housewives’ skills and at the same time, augment the meager income of
                        their families. In addition, awareness drives concerning health and other GAD-related
                        issues are being proposed to inculcate the importance of appropriate living conditions
                        for every member of the community.

                   III.   Strategies of Implementation

                          A.  Formation of Committee
                                     A committee was formed to study and gather benchmark information
                              on the status, needs, and conditions of selected communities in Tanza, Cavite
                              during the second semester, AY 2014 – 2015. The committee was headed by
                              the  Extension  Coordinator.  Two  faculty  members  from  the  different
                              departments of the campus were selected as members of the committee to
                              ensure that the programs will conform to the mandate of the university. The
                              committee  used  the  following  benchmark  information,  provided  by  Tanza
                              Municipal Planning and Development Office (TMPDO), in order to assess
                              which group of individuals will be the target beneficiaries of the proposal.

                          B.  Preparation of Committee

                                     The  proposal  to  conduct  extension  programs  in  the  community  was
                              based upon the respondent’s needs and interests that are consistent with the
                              goals of the campus and that have been identified through surveys.

                                     Some programs relative to the needs and interests of the residents were
                              not  considered  due  to  insufficiencies  on  facilities  and  absence  of  qualified
                              faculty members to handle such programs. This includes recycling of plastic
                              products, water lily bags, and perfume-making which may require raw materials
                              that are unavailable from the community.
                                     While having consultative meetings with the local government of the
                              concerned  barangay,  some  requests  to  the  university  were  raised.  First,  the
                              campus  will  have  to  offer  a  computer  literacy  program  for  their  barangay
                              officials and 4P’s members. This program aims to extend computer literacy to
                              the Brgy. Officials and selected 4P’s members, who, based on observation, lack
                              sufficient skills in computer manipulation and processes. The LGU believes that
                              technical  skills  must  be  manifested  by  their  officials  to  better  serve  their
                              constituents  and  for  those  4P’s  members  for  employment  and  business
                              opportunities.

                                     Also,  the  LGU  requested  that  the  proponents  offer  literacy  skills
                              development among their children. According to them, a number of children
                              were not enrolled in a formal school and parents of these children affirm that
                              they could not send them to formal school due to lack of financial resources,
                              that although education is free in public schools, they could not  provide the
                              requirements that their children must submit.

                                     Another  request  from  the  LGU  is  that  the  proponent  should  give
                              awareness campaigns on different health issues. According to them, the increase
                              in the rate of patients with dengue and AIDS/HIV in the province had been
                              alarming them and the residents. And because the proponent is a GAD advocate,
                              GAD-related issues and concerns were included in this awareness campaign,]]></page><page Index="10"><![CDATA[such as Anti-Violence against Women and their Children (anti-VAWC), sexual

                                            Number of Members not in favor
