Abstract                            The Extension Services Unit of Cavite State University – Tanza Campus has its approved                     program, BAGTAS with CvSU-Tanza: Bagtas ay Aasenso at Giginhawa kung Tayo ay Sama-sama                     with CvSU-Tanza. The conceptualization of the extension program was based on the community                      needs assessment of the people in its adopted barangay, Bagtas in Tanza, Cavite. The different                     extension activities were aligned with the diverse course offerings in Tanza Campus, such as BS                     Business  Management,  BS  Information  Technology,  Bachelor  in  Secondary  Education,  and                     Bachelor  in  Elementary  Education.  It  consists  of  four  (major)  components:  Oplan  Sulat-                     Basa/Oplan Karunungan, Computer Literacy, Livelihood Training, and Health and Wellness. The                      extension project was a five-year project with a one-year extension due to the pandemic. The                     project was able to train some individuals on different components who have benefitted well from                     the program. They are the four students and one out-of-school youth for Oplan Sulat-Basa, eight                     barangay officials and three 4Ps members for Computer Literacy, and nine community members                     for  Livelihood  Training.  The  project  also  gave  way  to  conceptualizing  Gourmet  de  Tanza,  a                     business featured in the morning show Umagang Kay Ganda in 2020.                  II.   Rationale                            Cavite  State  University:  Tanza  Campus  aims  to  deliver  quality  instructions,  conduct                     relevant research, and contribute to significant activities that will uplift the lives of our community                     beneficiaries. Hence, the campus would like to impart program activities for the extension that will                     empower people and improve their economic status and well-being.","The extension unit on this campus has chosen one of the barangays in Tanza, Cavite. It                     adopted  Barangay  Bagtas  for  the  campus  extension  activities.  The  population  explosion  in                     Barangay Bagtas has led to an initiative to alleviate poverty in the barangay. Barangay Bagtas,                     having the most significant number of populations in Tanza (20,370 out of 188,755), has been the                     site for relocation and reclamation. However, the people who relocated to the barangay have no                     regular living source. Some of them could not find a decent job because they lacked the education                      and requirements to apply for a job. Others could not start any business because they lack the                     skills to prepare innovative products that could help them earn additional income for their families.                            Thus, different extension activities are being proposed to increase the quality of life of the                     citizens in the said barangay. Non-formal education will help out-of-school children to be able to                     read, write, and count. Also, livelihood programs are deemed to strengthen housewives’ skills and                      at the same time, augment the meager income of their families.                            The extension activities conducted were anchored to the approved extension programs of                     Tanza Campus (BAGTAS with CvSU-Tanza: Bagtas ay Aasenso at  Giginhawa kung Tayo ay                     Sama-sama  with  CvSU-Tanza).  Moreover,  these  extension  program  activities  were  identified                     based on the result of the needs analysis conducted on each of the adopted barangays and sectors                     prior to the conceptualization of the extension programs.                  III.   Objectives                            The approved extension project contains different extension programs to align with the                     diverse course offerings in Cavite State University - Tanza Campus, such as Bachelor of Science                     in Business Management, Bachelor of Science in Information Technology, Bachelor in Secondary                     Education,  and  Bachelor  in  Elementary  Education,  as  well  as  diverse  specializations  in  the                     available pool of experts. While we give emphasis on need-based extension, it is also important                      that our extension program activities are relevant to available resources on the campus so that                     efficient and effective services can be offered to our clientele.                            The project generally aimed to empower and improve our adopted community's economic                     status and well-being. Based on the Community Needs Assessment done, there were four (4)","major program components addressed and conducted during the five years with the following                     specific objectives.                     :A.

Data utilized in the study mainly                      came from the responses to the self-administered survey questions that were distributed to the                     residents of Brgy. Bagtas. Residents were selected using simple random sampling.                            Results revealed that:                            ●  87.14%  of  the  residents  perceived  that  they  lack  regular  sources  of  living  in  the                                barangay because most (48.15%) of them lack the educational requirements and some                                (38.99%) lack the technical skills to either start a small business or to apply for a regular                                job;                             ●  47.06% of the residents believed that these problems and issues may be addressed                                through conduct of free seminars/trainings on livelihood programs;                            ●  18.33% of the residents suggested to conduct free seminar on candle making; 17.33%                                suggested soap making; 15.33% suggested delicacy preparation such as yema, ube,                                leche flan, puto, and others; 13.67% suggested dishwashing liquid making; 13.00%                                 suggested recycling of plastic products and water lily bags; while the remaining 8.67%                                suggested perfume-making;                            ●  46.50% of the residents said that they have baking and cooking skills and they are                                willing to undergo trainings for delicacy preparation; also 22.50% reiterated that they                                have the skills in the arts and trades and that they are willing to undergo trainings on                                preparation of innovative products such as candle, soap, and dishwashing liquid.","B. Preparation of Proposal                            The  proposal  to  conduct  extension  programs  in  the  community  was  based  on  the                     respondent’s needs and interests that are consistent with the goals of the campus and that have                     been identified through surveys.                            Some programs relative to the needs and interests of the residents were not considered                     due to insufficiencies in facilities and the absence of qualified faculty members to handle such                      programs. This includes recycling plastic products, water lily bags, and perfume-making which                     may require raw materials that are unavailable from the community.                            While having consultative meetings with the local government of the concerned barangay,                     some requests to the university were raised. First, the campus will have to offer a computer literacy                     program for their barangay officials and 4Ps members. This program aims to extend computer                      literacy  to  the  Brgy.  Officials  and  selected  4P’s  members,  who,  based  on  observation,  lack                     sufficient skills in computer manipulation and processes. The LGU believes that technical skills                     must be manifested by their officials to better serve their constituents and those 4Ps members for                     employment and business opportunities.                            Also, the LGU requested that the proponents offer literacy skills development among their                     children. According to them, several children have not enrolled in a formal school and the parents                     of these children affirm that they could not send them to formal school due to a lack of financial                      resources.  And  that  although  education  is  free  in  public  schools,  they  could  not  provide  the                     requirements that their children must submit.                     C. Meeting of the Committee                            A meeting of the campus Committee on Curriculum and Instruction was conducted on April                     10, 2015 to deliberate on the proposed extension programs in the campus.                            The following is the decision of the members of the committee:                                   Total Number of Committee Members                        :   15                                 Total number of Committee Members who were present       :   15                                 Total Number of Committee Members who were absent        :    0                                  Number of Members in favor of the proposal               :   15                                 Number of Members not in favor of the proposal           :    0","With this result, the following resolutions were passed by the Committee:                    Resolution No. 3, s. 2015                            “Approving the extension project proposal to alleviate poverty in Barangay Bagtas with the                     following  components:  (1)  Oplan  Karunungan;  (2)  Computer  Literacy  for  Brgy.

Implications and Recommendations                            Many activities were conducted during the implementation of the project, but still, it was                      not totally completed. The requested one-year extension of the project due to the pandemic was                     not enough. Many participants were not able to attend webinars due to a lack of gadgets like                     mobile phones, tablets, laptops, and others. Some had a poor internet connection and others had                     no internet connectivity at all.                            Another problem is that, although there are enough participants, many find it hard to pursue                     their  goals  after  the  training.  There  are  participants  who  had  a  problem  starting  their  own                      businesses due to a lack of funds.                            With the above-stated problems, the following actions are recommended:                     1.  Continue the goals of the campus by proposing a new extension project title but a continuation                        of this uncompleted extension project.                     2.  Assist  the  participants  in  achieving  their  goals,  the  campus  must  provide  a  reward  for                        motivation. School supplies, mobile phones, tablets, pocket wi-fi with free loads, and start-up                         capital for their desired businesses should be given to selected participants of the different                        components of the project.                     3.  Establish more partnerships with government and non-government agencies that will provide                        other needed resources.                     4.  Provide more training facilities and business demonstration areas in the community.","X.

Rationale       :                           The population explosion in Brgy. Bagtas has led to an initiative to alleviate poverty in the                   barangay.  Brgy. Bagtas, having the most number of populations in Tanza (20,370 out of 188,755),                   has been the site for relocation and reclamation.  However, people, who were displaced out of their                   previous addresses, were relocated in the said barangay without having a regular source of living.                   Some of them could not find a decent job because they lack the educational and other requirements                   for the job that they were applying for. Others could not start any business because they lack the","skills  in  preparing  innovative  products  that  could  help  them  earn  additional  income  for  their                   families.                           Thus, different extension activities are being proposed to increase the quality of life of the                   citizens in the said barangay. Non-formal education will help out-of-school children to be able to                   read, write and count. Also, livelihood programs deemed to strengthen housewives skills and at                   the  same  time,  augment  the  meager  income  of  their  families.  In  addition,  awareness  drives                   concerning health and other GAD-related issues are being proposed to inculcate the importance of                   appropriate living condition for every member of the community.               III.  Strategies of Implementation                    A.  Formation of Committee                              A committee was formed to study and gather benchmark information on the status,                       needs, and conditions of selected communities in Tanza, Cavite during the second semester,                       AY  2014  –  2015.  The  committee  was  headed  by the  Extension  Coordinator.  Two  faculty                       members  from  the  different  departments  of  the  campus  were  selected  as  members  of  the                       committee to ensure that the programs will conform to the mandate of the university. The                       committee used the following benchmark information, provided by Tanza Municipal Planning                       and Development Office (TMPDO), in order to assess which group of individuals will be the                       target beneficiaries of the proposal.

Data utilized in the study mainly                       came from the responses on the self-administered survey questions that were distributed to the                       residents of Brgy. Bagtas.  Residents were selected using simple random sampling.                               Results revealed that:                                  •  87.14% of the residents perceived that they lack regular sources of living in the                                     barangay because most (48.15%) of them lack the educational requirements and                                     some (38.99%) lack the technical skills to either start a small business or to                                     apply for a regular job;","•  47.06%  of  the  residents  believed  that  these  problems  and  issues  may  be                                     addressed through conduct of free seminars/trainings on livelihood programs;                                  •  18.33% of the residents suggested to conduct free seminar on candle making;                                     17.33% suggested soap making; 15.33% suggested delicacy preparation such as                                     yema, ube, leche flan, puto, and others; 13.67% suggested dishwashing liquid                                     making; 13.00% suggested recycling of plastic products and water lily bags;                                     while the remaining 8.67% suggested perfume-making;                                  •  46.50% of the residents said that they have baking and cooking skills and they                                     are willing to undergo trainings for delicacy preparation; also 22.50% reiterated                                     that they have the skills in the arts and trades and that they are willing to undergo                                     trainings  on  preparation  of  innovative  products  such  as  candle,  soap,  and                                     dishwashing liquid;                     B.  Preparation of Proposal                              The proposal to conduct extension programs in the community was based upon the                       respondent’s needs and interests that are consistent with the goals of the campus and that have                       been identified through surveys.                               Some programs relative to the needs and interests of the residents were not considered                       due to insufficiencies on facilities and absence of qualified faculty members to handle such                       programs. This includes recycling of plastic products, water lily bags, and perfume-making                       which may require raw materials that are unavailable from the community.                               While  having  consultative  meetings  with  the  local  government  of  the  concerned                       barangay, some requests to the university were raised. First, the campus will have to offer                       computer literacy program for their barangay officials and 4P’s members. This program aims                       to extend computer literacy to the Brgy. Officials and selected 4P’s members, who, based on                       observation, lack with sufficient skills in computer manipulation and processes. The LGU                       believes  that  technical  skills  must  be  manifested  by  their  officials  to  better  serve  their                       constituents and for those 4P’s members for employment and business opportunities.                               Also, the LGU requested that the proponents offer literacy skills development among                       their children. According to them, a number of children were not enrolled in a formal school                       and parents of these children affirm that they could not send them in formal school due to lack                       of financial resources, that although education is free in public schools, they could not provide                       the requirements that their children must submit.                               Another request from the LGU is that the proponent should give awareness campaigns                       on different health issues. According to them, the increase in the rate of patients with dengue                       and AIDS/HIV in the province had been alarming them and the residents. And because the                       proponent  is  a  GAD  advocate,  GAD-related  issues  and  concerns  were  included  in  this                       awareness campaign, such as Anti-Violence against Women and their Children (anti-VAWC),                       sexual harassment among others.","C.  Meeting of the Committee                              A meeting of the campus Committee on Curriculum and Instruction was conducted on                       April 10, 2015 to deliberate on the proposed extension programs in the campus.                               The following is the decision of the members of the committee:                                         Total Number of Committee Members              :      15                                          Total Number of Committee Members who                                                were present                            :      15                                          Total Number of Committee Members who                                                were absent                             :      0                                          Number of Members in favor of the                                                proposal                                :      15                                          Number of Members not in favor of the                                                proposal                                :      0                                With this result, the following resolutions were passed by the Committee:                               Resolution No. 3, s. 2015                                      “Approving the extension project proposal to alleviate poverty in Barangay                              Bagtas with the following components: (1) Oplan Karunungan; (2) Computer Literacy                              for Brgy.
