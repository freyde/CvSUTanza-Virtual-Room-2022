BAGTAS GENERAL ASSEMBLY AND CONSULTATIVE MEETING                  Cavite State University – Tanza Campus held its second general assembly and consultative meeting on          October 5, 2019. The assembly and consultative meeting was held from 8:00 a.m. until 4:00 pm at the covered           court of Lumina Subdivision where hundreds of Bagtas residents participated.                 The event started out with the words of welcome given by the  Barangay Bagtas Chairperson, Engr.          Manuel T. Mintu, Jr. Then, he also acknowledged the Sangguniang Barangay Members and Staff as well as the          faculty members of the campus.                 After that, Mr. Cris Albert P. Cajigas delivered his message to the residents of Barangay Bagtas about          the extension programs of the campus. He talked about the various extension programs of the campus. Thus,          he explained that different extension activities are conducted to increase the quality of life of the citizens in the           barangay.  Non-formal  education  will  help  out-of-school  children  to  be  able  to  read,  write  and  count.  Also,          livelihood programs deemed to strengthen housewives skills and at the same time, augment the meager income          of  their  families.  In  addition,  awareness  drives  concerning  health  and  other  GAD-related  issues  are  also          conducted to inculcate the importance of appropriate living condition for every member of the community.                 Furthermore, Mr. Ritch M. Banate, the extension coordinator of the campus introduced the upcoming           activities of the campus per extension programs. It was observed that the residents of the barangay were really          excited to participate in the various activities. This only means that the residents or stakeholders of the barangay          were really interested to help the barangay alleviate poverty.                 After the extension coordinator introduced and explained the extension programs of the campus, the          residents were given the opportunity to raise their concerns regarding the different problems they face within          their community. One of those is about the growing population in Bagtas as the result of lack of knowledge about          reproductive health and family planning. As a response, the campus promised to conduct an extension activity           about reproductive health and family planning in response to their concern. Several questions were raised that          were really relevant to the formation of various extension activities of the campus.","The closing remarks of Prof. Mildred A. Sebastian concluded the general assembly and consultative           meeting. Her message focused on the importance of people’s participation in this kind of event as it is a venue          for a healthy dialogue where issues and concerns were raised and addressed by the campus.
