CvSU -                  Received:                Tanza Campus (CvSU - TC),  a non-stock, non-profit government HEI, is exerting                  09 January 2019          effort to produce globally competitive graduates  so that these graduates can land                                           a job  six months  after graduation.  To  examine the determinants of employment                  Accepted:                status  among  the  CvSU  -  TC  graduates,  this  study  used  logistic  regression                  01  Month Year                                           analysis.  The  data  used  in  this  study  came  from  the  personal  profile  of the                                           graduates  and  their  responses  in  the  exit  interview  conducted  when  they                 Keywords                                           accomplished  their  graduation  clearance.  A  total  of 120  graduates  under  the                  employability            Bachelor of  Science in Business Management, Bachelor of  Science in Information                  logistic regression      Technology,  and Bachelor of Secondary Education programs from years 2016 to                  graduates                2018 were the subjects of  the study.  The dependent variable is employability of                  tracer                   the graduates which is described as dichotomous (employed, unemployed).  Nine                                           (9) independent variables were considered in this study.  These were the age, civil                                           status, verbal  ability test results,  mathematical ability test results,  monthly family                                           income,  cumulative grade point average,  personal  quality  skills,  critical  thinking                                           skills and technical skills.  The logistic regression model  shows that only the age,                                           civil  status,  verbal  ability  test results,  critical  thinking skills  and technical  skills                                           were determinants of  employability of  a CvSU - TC graduate.  The campus may                                           strengthen the OIT component of  its curricular offerings in order to offset the lack                                           of  experience; while prioritizing the communication skills,  human relations skills,                                           entrepreneurial  skills, and critical thinking skills across all its programs in order to                                           land jobs that are congruent to their academic preparation.                   Introduction                   Students pursue higher or tertiary education in the hope of  getting employed after graduation.  However,  college                 graduates  are  confronted  with  the  serious problem  of unemployment.  Graduates  are faced,  not  only with the                 problem of  not obtaining employment but also with that of  landing a job that is in congruence with their academic                 preparation.                  Employment  refers to the  condition where people,  who  are being  capable of working,  were being  employed -                 either by himself  or through other people.  It refers to an opportunity in the advancement in one's financial status.                 It is also  a significant achievement for the university  because the higher the employment rate of the university,                 the better the students it produced and the higher the quality of  education it offered.                  Employment  seems to be elusive to most of the college graduates.  Along  with the  soaring population and  an                 increasing number of  graduates available for employment, every year goes the slimmer chance of  being employed.                 Students who foresee this situation tend to take more popular courses that they assume to give them better chances                 of  employment.  In fact, a number of  studies revealed that an employment prospect is the biggest factor affecting                 course  preference.  Good  employment  opportunities  were  the  most  important  reasons  for  secondary  school                 graduates pursuing higher education.                  On the  other hand,  employability  refers to the capacity to gain  initial  employment,  maintain employment  and                 obtain employment ifrequired (Hillage \& Pollard,  1998 as cited by Tran,  2016).  The employability of  graduates                 from an institution is very important concern ofHEI'  s (Antiojo, 2018). Evidences indicate a growing apprehension                 to evaluate the performance of  graduates,  the relevance of  the curriculum offered,  and the satisfaction of  alumni                 with their academic preparations through tracer studies of  graduates.","2    Sebastian, Banate \& Jgmasine                    Considering  the  factors  which  affect  the  employability  of an  individual,  evaluation  of employment  status  is                 indispensable in determining whether a graduate of CvSU - Tanza Campus (CvSU-TC) will be employed by a                 certain employer after graduation.                  The study was conducted to have a follow-up on the CvSU-TC graduates regarding their employment status and                 know what jobs and positions they have landed after graduation.  Benchmark information about the status of its                graduates is to be provided for the campus.  This will serve as a reliable foundation for the future development of                programs and services pertinent to the Campus goals.                  The facts that the  study will  come up  with  are beneficial  to the students,  faculty  and  administration to  further                 promote a deeper understanding of  the curricula - their strengths and weaknesses.  Findings and results are very                 substantial  into  the  betterment  of the  programs  offerings  and  development  activities  in  consonance  with  the                 requirements of the industry.  Lastly,  this  study  can motivate newly graduates to improve themselves for better                 chances of  being employed relative to the factors that affect the employment status.                 This  study focused  on the evaluation  of employment status of CvSU - Tanza Campus graduates from  2016 to                 2018  and  the  factors  affecting  their  employability.  Specifically,  it  aimed  to  find  answers  to  the  following                 questions:              ·                    1.  What is the employment and unemployment rate of CvSU - TC graduates?                    2.  What necessary employment competencies learned in college do graduates had developed as perceived                        by their employers?                    3.  What factors affect graduates' employability?                 Review of Related Literature                  Workers are considered employed if  they  have either full or part time jobs or self-employed even if  they are not                working at  specified  period  of time.  However,  there  are other  considerations  to  deal  with when  one  refers  to                 employment.                 Employment has been the subject of  discussions and studies by a number of  economists,  in the Philippines,  Tan                 as cited by Arellano (2012) concluded that there is an unusually high level  ofunemployment among the educated                 of  the labor force aptly called the \"educated unemployed.\"  Although education is not a guarantee of  employment,                 an ordinary layman would expect unemployment notes to decrease as the level of  education rises.                  One  of the  indicators  of an  effective  program  like  the  educational  program  in  technical  education  is  the                 employability  of its  graduates.  Following  the  acquisition  of knowledge  and  skills,  there  must  be  an  actual                 application or utilization  of such  \"here  and  now\".  This educational  philosophy  can be actually  fulfilled  if the                 output  of technical  education  can  find  employment  after  graduation.  Employability  therefore  is  one  of the                 indicators in evaluating a technology program.                  One of  the immediate concerns of  policymakers in Higher Education Institutions (HEl's) is the employability of                 their graduates  in the  cutting-edge  economies.  Problems  regarding  the  employability  of graduates  were  given                 renewed  focus  in the  current  climate  of the  labor market.  Educators  continue to  emphasize the  importance  of                 employability competencies' in order for graduates to be fully prepared  in meeting the tasks of an  increasingly                 flexible labor market.  A number of studies  regarding the  employability  of education  graduates  in the  country                 proved  the  importance  of this  particular  concern  among  educators  and  policymakers.  A  study  regarding  the                 employability of  teacher education graduates of  an Asian public university was undertaken by Boholano in 2012.                 The study exposed  that among the education graduates with English,  Math and  Science specialization,  Science                 majors are highly employable while Mathematics majors were also teaching Computer Education and Economics                 subjects.  Moreover,  many  Mathematics  major  graduates  pursue  postgraduate  studies  for  professional  and                 academic growth,  concentrating either in research or advanced courses in Mathematics.  Furthermore,  the study                 revealed that challenging/interesting work,  high salary,  and professional growth are the three top priorities in the                 workplace for graduates were looking for.  Aquino, Punongbayan, Macalaguim, Bauyon,  Rodriguez,  and Quizon                 (2015)  conducted the Teacher Education  Graduate Tracer Study  from 2010 to  2014 in one  State University  in                 Batangas.  The results divulged that majority of  the graduates are passers ofLicensure Examination for Teachers                 (LET), and are employed in public schools relevant to their degree.  Their present employment was also their first                job,  it took them  only  a  moderate period  of time  to  land  a job  and  most  of them  stay  in  their  profession  for                 economic reasons.  The graduates asserted that  communication  skills and  human relation  skills acquired  during                 their pre-service education were very relevant to their jobs.","International Journal of  Education in Mathematics,  Science and Technology (IJEMST)   3                    Valenzuela et al (2012) asserted that graduate employability is a function ofa range of  individual characteristics.                 Employability attributes include significant manageable skills such as adaptability,  intellectual  skills,  teamwork                 and  basic  interpersonal  skills  and  their usefulness  to  the  graduates  in  their jobs.  The  employed  respondents                 emphasized the importance of  educational qualifications and job-specific skills to be successful in their jobs. Both                 unemployed and employed graduates have expressed their desire to get jobs that are related to their chosen fields.                 Job-seeking strategies such as the use of  the internet, walk-in interviews and attendance at job fairs demonstrate                 the respondents' use ofboth formal and informal search methods.  It was also noted that the unemployed graduates                 gave a greater weight to starting salary when choosing a job.  This supports a suggestion that wage flexibility may                 be  important  to  an  individuals'  employability.  The  findings  of Galila-Infante,  Junco,  and  Marquez  (2014)                 regarding the Employment Status of  the Graduates ofGuimaras State College, Philippines revealed that majority                 of the  graduates were  employed  on  a  contractual  basis  with  a monthly  salary  of  PS,  000.00  to  less than PIO,                 000.00. Those who were not employed prioritized their family responsibility.  It was noted in the study that the                 Filipino  families  value  education  as  means to  finding  better  employment  opportunities.  The  study  of Labaria                 (2016) explored the Job Satisfaction and Employability ofEducation Graduates of  Western Philippines University                 Quezon Campus.  It was revealed that the respondents are  satisfied with their job, they found it challenging and                 motivates them to do their best and the chance to grow professionally in their present job was described as very                 high.  Correspondingly,  they  found  contentment  in  teaching  coupled  with  a  feeling  of belongingness  in  their                 present  work.  Hence,  education  graduates  have  unlimited  chances  in  the  professional  world  both  in  the                 government and private educational institutions.                   Methodology                         Locale of the Study                               The  study was  conducted at  CvSU - Tanza Campus.  Employment  data were  collected from                        individual graduates, employed or unemployed, during the data gathering.                         Sampling Procedure                               Since there is a meager number of  graduates from 2016 -  2018, complete enumeration was used.                        Every graduate of CvSU - Tanza Campus participated  in the study.

The  questionnaire  consisted  of various                        information  of the graduates  such as general  information,  educational  background,  trainings attended,                        and employment data.  The respondents were asked to give the information needed in the form.                                Also, snowball sampling was used to collect data from other respondents.                         Data Analysis                               Descriptive  statistics  was  used  to  determine the  employment  rate  and  classify  the  graduates                        according  to the  socio-demographic  information  that  they  provided  in  the  forms.  Frequency  counts,                        percentages,  standard deviations and averages were used to report these information.                                Inferential  statistics  was  used  to  determine  the  association  between  CvSU-TC  graduate's                        employability and the factors,  such as civil  status, sex, and honors received in college, that affect his/her                        employability.  Since categorical variables are involved,  chi-square test of  association was used.                                Also,  the  degree  of relation  between  a  graduates'  competencies  and  his  employability  was                        determined using the Pearson moment correlation coefficient.","4    Sebastian, Banate \& Jgmasine                  Observations/Findings                        Employment/Unemployment Rate of CvSU - TC Graduates;                               Table 2  presents the employment and unemployment  rate of CvSU - TC Graduates.  It  can be                       seen that  most  (82.5%) of the graduates were employed.  In  addition,  the highest employment  rate of                       90.91% was recorded at the BSE program, which was followed by the BSBM program with 83.33%; the                       lowest unemployment rate of  73.91 % was recorded at the BSIT program.

Conclusions and Recommendations                            CvSU - Tanza Campus graduates registered an employment rate of 82.50% that is relatively higher                    among  other  higher  education  institutions.  Employers'  feedback  among  the  CvSU  - Tanza  Campus'                    graduates  are  relatively  high.   Among  these  skills,   communication,  JCT  skills,   human                    relations/entrepreneurial, problem solving, and critical thinking skills were the top five skills which the CvSU                    -  TC  graduates  possessed.   The  employability  of  graduates  is  determined  by  his/her  civil  status,                    communication, human relations,  entrepreneurial, and critical thinking skills.                             Among  other things,  it was  strongly recommended that Cavite  State University - Tanza  Campus                    should  seriously  consider  institutionalizing  a  Job  Placement  Unit  under  the  Guidance  Office  or  Student                    Affairs and Services Office.  This unit shall assist its graduates in seeking for a job.  It shall also help enhance                    a graduate's employability.                            The campus may also strengthen the OJT component of  its curricular offerings in order to offset the                    lack of  experience; while prioritizing the communication skills, human relations skills,  entrepreneurial skills,                    and critical thinking skills across all its programs.                            Shifting  drastically  from  the  traditional  modes  of teaching  to  the  more  modem  and  progressive                    modalities may also help in the development of  students' higher order thinking skills.

For  the  rehired  faculty  members  and  staffs,  it                       serves  as  a  reorientation and reminder t always  set an example  not only to                       students but also to the newly-hired employees.
