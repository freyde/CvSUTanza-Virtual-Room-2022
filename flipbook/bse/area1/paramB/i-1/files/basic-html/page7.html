                Considering  the  factors  which  affect  the  employability  of an  individual,  evaluation  of employment  status  is
                indispensable in determining whether a graduate of CvSU - Tanza Campus (CvSU-TC) will be employed by a
                certain employer after graduation.

                The study was conducted to have a follow-up on the CvSU-TC graduates regarding their employment status and
                know what jobs and positions they have landed after graduation.  Benchmark information about the status of its
               graduates is to be provided for the campus.  This will serve as a reliable foundation for the future development of
               programs and services pertinent to the Campus goals.

                The facts that the  study will  come up  with  are beneficial  to the students,  faculty  and  administration to  further
                promote a deeper understanding of  the curricula - their strengths and weaknesses.  Findings and results are very
                substantial  into  the  betterment  of the  programs  offerings  and  development  activities  in  consonance  with  the
                requirements of the industry.  Lastly,  this  study  can motivate newly graduates to improve themselves for better
                chances of  being employed relative to the factors that affect the employment status.
                This  study focused  on the evaluation  of employment status of CvSU - Tanza Campus graduates from  2016 to
                2018  and  the  factors  affecting  their  employability.  Specifically,  it  aimed  to  find  answers  to  the  following
                questions:              ·
                   1.  What is the employment and unemployment rate of CvSU - TC graduates?
                   2.  What necessary employment competencies learned in college do graduates had developed as perceived
                       by their employers?
                   3.  What factors affect graduates' employability?

               Review of Related Literature

                Workers are considered employed if  they  have either full or part time jobs or self-employed even if  they are not
               working at  specified  period  of time.  However,  there  are other  considerations  to  deal  with when  one  refers  to
                employment.

               Employment has been the subject of  discussions and studies by a number of  economists,  in the Philippines,  Tan
                as cited by Arellano (2012) concluded that there is an unusually high level  ofunemployment among the educated
                of  the labor force aptly called the "educated unemployed."  Although education is not a guarantee of  employment,
                an ordinary layman would expect unemployment notes to decrease as the level of  education rises.

                One  of the  indicators  of an  effective  program  like  the  educational  program  in  technical  education  is  the
                employability  of its  graduates.  Following  the  acquisition  of knowledge  and  skills,  there  must  be  an  actual
                application or utilization  of such  "here  and  now".  This educational  philosophy  can be actually  fulfilled  if the
                output  of technical  education  can  find  employment  after  graduation.  Employability  therefore  is  one  of the
                indicators in evaluating a technology program.

                One of  the immediate concerns of  policymakers in Higher Education Institutions (HEl's) is the employability of
                their graduates  in the  cutting-edge  economies.  Problems  regarding  the  employability  of graduates  were  given
                renewed  focus  in the  current  climate  of the  labor market.  Educators  continue to  emphasize the  importance  of
                employability competencies' in order for graduates to be fully prepared  in meeting the tasks of an  increasingly
                flexible labor market.  A number of studies  regarding the  employability  of education  graduates  in the  country
                proved  the  importance  of this  particular  concern  among  educators  and  policymakers.  A  study  regarding  the
                employability of  teacher education graduates of  an Asian public university was undertaken by Boholano in 2012.
                The study exposed  that among the education graduates with English,  Math and  Science specialization,  Science
                majors are highly employable while Mathematics majors were also teaching Computer Education and Economics
                subjects.  Moreover,  many  Mathematics  major  graduates  pursue  postgraduate  studies  for  professional  and
                academic growth,  concentrating either in research or advanced courses in Mathematics.  Furthermore,  the study
                revealed that challenging/interesting work,  high salary,  and professional growth are the three top priorities in the
                workplace for graduates were looking for.  Aquino, Punongbayan, Macalaguim, Bauyon,  Rodriguez,  and Quizon
                (2015)  conducted the Teacher Education  Graduate Tracer Study  from 2010 to  2014 in one  State University  in
                Batangas.  The results divulged that majority of  the graduates are passers ofLicensure Examination for Teachers
                (LET), and are employed in public schools relevant to their degree.  Their present employment was also their first
               job,  it took them  only  a  moderate period  of time  to  land  a job  and  most  of them  stay  in  their  profession  for
                economic reasons.  The graduates asserted that  communication  skills and  human relation  skills acquired  during
                their pre-service education were very relevant to their jobs.</code></pre>
