RATIONALE                        Education has a predominant role in fulfilling our aspirations in life may it be through inclusive                 and special needs education and whether it is in a public or private institution. Its main agenda is to                 make us knowledgeable and less ignorant. The growth of social awareness on the plight of the less                 fortunate persons with disabilities has led the government to facilitate opportunities for them to develop                 their full potential in school especially in inclusive education so that they can live independently while                 enjoying  their  rights  and  privileges  as  human  beings.  As  we  give  value  to  diversity  along  with                 considering the uniqueness of everyone, this will forge strong bonds to aid in the exploration of one's                 passion, talent, and capabilities.                        As we grow and blend in the information age, it is also right to consider adapting technology-                 based  teaching  and learning  to  special and inclusive education.  Digital  technology  has  a  potential                 impact for a wider access to learning and may open doors to new teaching strategies. The goal of this                 webinar is to promote the utilization of technology-based teaching strategy to promote quality, relevant,                                               st                 and effective instruction for the 21  century learners. Furthermore, this webinar aims to recognize the                 highlight of the current inclusive practices and role of digital technologies in special education. As we                 reach for our goals in life, this webinar will serve as a reminder that we are all capable if we have the                 eagerness to discover our potential with appreciation towards others regardless of all our differences.
