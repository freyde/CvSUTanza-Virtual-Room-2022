The church is called to display unity and peace. All of this is meant to be so                regardless of ethnicity, socioeconomic status, gender, etc. However, there are many problems                and issues that arouse the public's attention in the community when it comes between Gender                and the Churches. Some of these are church governance and leadership; churches engaging                with  gender  equity;  churches  responding  to  gender  in  the  home  and  society;  horny  ethical                issues related to sexuality and reproductive choices; and the issue of same-sex marriage. All of                these  topics  are  debatable;  however, this case analysis  will focus on the issue of Same-Sex                Marriage, which is the process of unification of two people of the same sex that was unaccepted                by the majority, especially by the people in the church. The increasing number of people who                are open and interested in this issue is one of the reasons why it has become internationally                controversial. As a result, many countries, particularly in Western Europe and the United States,                legalized  same-sex  marriage. However, most  countries  don't  recognize  the  reformation  of                marriage in their Constitution, including the Philippines, because many Filipinos are Christians                who believe that marriage is a sacred union of man and woman only.                   Background                         The Philippines is a country whose belief in marriage is mostly in lined with morals and                cultural aspects where a majority of its principles were taught through Christianity. Marriage, as                stated in Art. 1 of the Family Code is a special contract of permanent union between a man and                a  woman  entered  into  in  accordance  with  the  law.  It’s  clearly  stipulated  in  the  mentioned                provision that only a man and a woman can enter into a valid marriage ceremony. This definition                has been the roots of all arguments, debates and controversies because of the acceptance of                the Filipinos to the rise of LGBTQ+ community or the “third-sex” society and the raising of the                issue on equal protection clause and their equal right to marry, and conjugal rights.                         Same sex marriage is the practice of marriage between two people of the same gender.                In  the  late twentieth century, debates about the legalization of same-sex marriage around the                world  have  been  publicly  noticeable  in  view  of  the  strong  opposition  of  Christianity  as  they                consider it as morally wrong. On one hand, some scholars have argued that same-sex unions                were  recognized  by  the  Roman  Catholic  Church  in  medieval  Europe,  although  others  have                disputed this claim. Scholars and the general public became increasingly interested in the issue                during the late 20th century, a period when attitudes toward homosexuality and laws regulating                homosexual behavior were liberalized, particularly in Western Europe and the United States. In                the  year  2000,  as  research  shows,  Netherlands  granted  religious rites of marriage and legal                recognition to LGBTQ+ Community. In light of its decision, 20 other countries legalized marriage                for same sex couples. Though few more countries are in the process of assessing legitimizing","same sex marriage, still, majority of these countries doesn’t recognized reformation of marriage                in their Constitution, and this include the Philippines.                         The  Philippines  is  a  predominantly  Christian  country,  from  which  morality  and                Christianity  has  always been an influence in the society. This has been the core reason why                being a conservative individual matters for Filipino, especially one that involves marriage. As a                matter of discussion, there are house bills regarding same sex marriage has been introduced in                the Philippine laws such as: House Bill No. 6595, House Bill No. 3179. In 2011, there was a bill                filed  to  amend  Article  26  of  the  Philippine  Family  Code,  to  prohibit  “forbidden  marriages.”                Specifically, this sought to bar the Philippines from recognizing same-sex marriages contracted                overseas. However, these bills did not advance.                   Evaluation of the Case                         The Philippines is principally a Christian country, particularly a Roman Catholic nation.                Although  there  is  a  separation  of  the  church  and  the  state,  lawmakers  of  the  Philippines                consider deriving morals from the Bible in legislating law. The main focus of this case analysis is                the  issue  of  the  legalization  of  same-sex  marriage  in  our  country.  The  religious  principles,                culture and social acceptance, and marriage provisions of the Family Code of the Philippines                were  the main hindrances that dismissed the petition of the LGBTQ+ community. This is the                reason  why  as  of  now,  the  Philippines  does  not  recognize same-sex marriages between its                citizens and still has a solid and ongoing debate regarding the legality of marriage for same-sex                couples.                                 If  the  government  legalizes  same-sex  marriage,  it  will violate the majority's religious                freedom and long-held morals. According to the Holy Bible, homosexuality is considered a sin                as stated in the book of Leviticus 18:22 \"Do not have sexual relations with a man as one does                with  a  woman;  that  is  detestable.” This means that same-sex marriage is unrighteous in the                eyes  of  the  Lord.  It  goes  against  His  intended  design  for us, for a man and a woman to be                united  in  holy  matrimony.  According  to  Mark  10:6-9, saying, \"But at the beginning of creation                God' made them male and female. For this reason, a man will leave his father and mother and                be united with his wife, and the two will become one flesh. So they are no longer two, but one                flesh. Therefore what God has joined together, let no one separate.\"                            Sadly, there are countries legally recognizing same-sex marriage like the Netherlands,                the USA, Iceland, etc. Same-sex marriage devalues traditional marriage and family. Why should                the law, our morals, tradition and nature be altered to fit something not normal? Conforming to                what  is  trending  does  not  mean  conforming to what is wrong. Purely, equality is the primary                concern raised by the LGBTQ+ community of wanting to legalize same-sex marriage. Aren't we                practicing equality already? They are human too,  meaning they are included in the practice of                human  rights,  especially  the  right  to  be  married,  provided  that  it  is  with  the  opposite  sex.                Enabling law redefining and changing the parties who may contract marriage is only beneficial                to  the  citizens  of  a  same-sex  relationship.  Father  Marcos Gonzales once said, \"The Church","says that homosexuals should be treated with love and respect but redefining the natural and                divine institution of marriage is simply something we are not able to do.\" If man were to change                the  true  essence  of  marriage  and  family,  which  is  the  basic  unit  of  the society, what would                happen to the Philippines?                 Proposed Solution/Changes                         The  stances  of  faith  on  same-sex  marriage  issues  of  different  religions  such  as                Buddhism,  Islam,  Reform  Judaism,  and  Hinduism  in  general,    there  is  no  rule  or  formal                ordination process for the LGBTQ+ community but usually requires years of study. As of now,                the Philippines does not recognize same-sex relationships or same-sex marriages between its                citizens. The solution we come up with to these debated topics for the sake of rights and benefit                in the eyes of the law is to adopt the civil union in the Philippines. A civil union is legal protection                to  the  couple  only at the state level. It is a marriage-like legal status, currently only issued to                new  couples  in  a  few  states  like  Colorado,  Hawaii,  Illinois,  and  New  Jersey.  Originally                established  to  provide  many  of  the  same  protections  that  marriage  offers  to  same-sex  and                heterosexual couples.                         Civil unions often share the same protections as marriages in states where they are still                issued or recognized. When the spouse dies, the Estate Planning can inherit all of its assets                without  incurring  taxes.  The  employment  -  can  be  covered  by  the  spouse's  employment                benefits,  such  as  health  insurance,  and  have  the  right  to  bereavement  leave  if  the  spouse                passes away. The healthcare - may have the right to make medical decisions on behalf of the                spouse  and  have  unlimited  visitation privileges if they are sick. The parental rights, both may                share  joint  parental  rights  over  your  children.  The  property  -  may  co-own  property  as  joint                owners  and  have  the  right  of  survivorship if one spouse passes away. The separation  - can                seek alimony if your civil union is dissolved. The spousal privilege - cannot be forced to testify                against the spouse in court. The taxes  - can file state taxes jointly. (Though federal taxes still                have to be filed separately.) While these rights are the same in marriage, the primary difference                is that civil union partners are only guaranteed these protections within the state. A civil union                does not entitle a couple to the federal benefits that only marriage can provide                  Conclusion and Recommendations                         The  researchers  found  that  same-sex  marriage  is  only  beneficial  to  the  citizens of a                same-sex relationship. Although many Filipino citizens willingly accept the relationship of same-                sex couples, the probability that same-sex marriage will be allowed here in the Philippines is, for                now,  highly  impossible.  One  main  reason  is  that  the  Philippines  is  a  Catholic  country,  and                legalizing  same-sex  marriage  weakens  and  contradicts  the  teachings  and  doctrines  of  the                Church, which defines marriage as a union between a man and a woman. Another reason is                that it would ruin the concept of a family. In a typical setup, a family is composed of a father, a                mother, and a child or children. On the bright side, the Philippines is not closing its doors to the","changes that may happen shortly. Especially since the Filipino citizens always go with what we                call \"uso\" or trending.                         Therefore,  the  researchers  recommend  that  the  citizen  of the Philippines read this to                consider  the  disadvantages  and  advantages  of  the  adoption  of  same-sex  marriage.  The                legislators should also make the definition of marriage and equal rights in our constitution clear                to avoid confusion and conflict involving the rights and privileges of the people.   It should also                be followed by the proper interpretation of the judiciary. In addition to this we recommend that                the  government  and  legislators  should  consider  passing  civil  unions  instead  of  same-sex                marriage. Civil unions and marriages have similar definitions. A civil union is a legal relationship                between two people that provides legal protection to the couple at the state level. If a couple is                in  a  civil union they get inheritance rights, employment benefits, property, parental rights, and                more.  Also,  the  Philippines  should  indeed  be  a  gender-fair  society  except  for  same-sex                marriage. We and the researchers are in favor of same-sex union but not same-sex marriage.

It has given different opinion from people.                               As we remember, last year by the month of November there is a teacher who                complained by the parent of one of her student because it said that she let her student                out of the classroom because the student left the report card at home. The parents                complained because they were afraid that the child might be traumatized and would                not go to school. The grandmother wanted to sue the teacher but the students mother                felt sorry for her so she just wanted the teacher to have her license revoked. After                 the complained, on the same month and year some of the teacher protested and shout                that it is not Raffy Tulfo will judge the fate of teacher Melita Limjuco.                            In my personal opinion, I can say that both camps are both wrong. Why? Let’s                start with the teacher who is said that she let her student out and embarrased. Being                 teacher is one of the most hardiest responsibility but because we took this profession                we  have  to  stand  by  it  and  we  must  have  a  long  patience.  Parents  entrust  their                children to us so we need to stand up for being second parents to their children. We                all known that there are times that some of students and naughty and reprehensible,                but the best way to do is tell to their parents right away to disciplined them. And if                teachers try to discipline students, do it in a good and right way. And now, let’s talk                about the student’s parents who complained. I can say that they should have talk to                 the teacher first about what is really happend, the should have known first what was                the reason and where the teacher’s anger came from before going to any complains.                As a parents, we must know our responsibilities to our children when studyimg just                like reminders about what to pass or what to bring.","But all in all, the lesson here is ‘think before take an action’ not only for the family                of the student but also for the teacher.

It                 encouraged  everyone  to  step  forward  and  excel  in  creating  positive  effects  where                 recognition and achievement can be acquired. Filipino graduates with previously 10 years of                  basic education, have been criticized in terms of their level of competency. Thus, Philippines                 have  adopted  the  K  to  12  curriculum  to  address  the  problem.  The  adoption  of  the  new                 curriculum is said to enhance the quality of basic education in the country. Furthermore, it                 will help students to be prepared when facing the demands of the 21st century. This is in fact                 in  line  with  Article  XIV,  Section  2(1)  of  the  1987  Philippine  Constitution  which  states  that                 “The  State  shall  establish,  maintain,  and  support  a  complete,  adequate,  and  integrated                 system of education relevant to the needs of the people and society.”                           When  people  heard  news  of  the  K-12  program  implementation  in  the  country,  it                 received mixed reactions. Suddenly, there was a combination of backlashes and praise in                  the  background  with  the  students  left  puzzled  on  whose  voice  to  listen  to.  There  are  still                 challenges and standards of quality to consider but the important thing is to establish that                 development is present as a result of the new program.                           K  stands  for  kindergarten  and  12  refers  to  the  succeeding  12  years  of  basic                 education, which is why it is called K to 12. The 12 years of basic education comprises of 6                 years  of  elementary  education,  4  years of  junior  high  school,  and  2  years  of  senior  high                 school. The K-12 program offers a 12-year program for the students which aim to give them                  sufficient  time  to  master  skills  and  acquire  basic  competencies  with  the  goal  of  being                 competitive on a global scale. Students of the new system will be equipped with the skills                 required to be ready for employment, entrepreneurship, middle-level skills development, and                 higher education even if they intend to do so after graduation.                         K to 12 programs has been implemented by the Department of Education throughout                 the whole country. Five years ago, the Philippines was the only country in Southeast Asia","that provided just 10 years of basic education to its population but ever since the K to 12                 implementations, the country has joined its neighbors in adopting an education system that                 will provide more opportunities to students on a global scale.                    Background of Study                           The K to 12 Program covers kindergarten and 12 years of basic education ( six years                 of  primary  education,  four  years  of  junior  high  school,  and  two  years  of  senior  high                 school(SHS) to provide sufficient time for mastery of concepts and skills, develop lifelong                 learners,  and  prepare  graduates  for  tertiary  education,  middle-level  skills  development,                 employment and entrepreneurship.                           According to President Benigno S. Aquino III, “We need to add two years to our basic                 education. Those who can afford pay up to fourteen years of schooling before university.                 Thus, their children are getting into the best universities and the best jobs after graduation. I                  want  at  least  12  years  for  our  public  school  children  to  give  them  an  even  chance  at                 succeeding.” Cognizant of this urgent and critical concern and in line with the priorities of the                 Aquino  Administration,  the  Department  of  Education  is  taking  bold  steps  to  enhance  the                 basic  education  curriculum.  Hand  in  hand  with  vigorous  efforts  to  address  the  input                 shortages, DepEd intends to raise the quality of basic education through the enhancement of                  the  curriculum  and  the  expansion  of  the  basic  education  cycle.  (DepEd,  2010).  The                 Commission  on  Higher  Education  (CHED)  believes  that  senior  high  will  be  college  ready                 regardless  of  the  track  while  the  Technical  Education  and  Skills  Development  Authority                 (TESDA) will provide Certificate of Completion (COC) or NCI after grade 10 and NC II after                 grade 12, which will improve employability in fields of agriculture, electronics and trade.                           The new curriculum allows students to choose between three tracks which are the                 Academic, Technical-Vocational-Livelihood, and the Sports and Arts strand","Starting with Kindergarten as the foundation for lifelong learning and development, the 12-                 year curriculum aims to give students the journey in education that they deserve. Foreign                 countries perceive that a ten-year curriculum in the education department is insufficient that                 is  why  many Filipinos abroad  are  not  recognized  professionals.  With  the  new  curriculum,                  graduates are fully equipped with the skills which can help them stand out on a global scale                 and compete accordingly according to international standards.                 The government implemented the K to 12 programs to enhance the educational system of                 the  country  in  order  to  accelerate  the  mutual  recognition  of  Filipino  graduates  and                 professionals across the world. Learners were able to master the skills and develop core                  competencies which are the essential things to meet the demand of the global market. This                 analysis used a systematic approach and review design to come up with a general idea that                 answers the main objectives of this research review. This research specifically looked into                 the different perspectives of the teachers, parents and students on the implementation of the                 K-12 program in the Philippines which added two more years before a student can proceed                 to college. It also described the various problems that arise as a result of the implementation                 of this new program and the action plans established by the government to address these                  issues. Moreover, to make possible recommendations that help improve the curriculum to                 make sure that quality education can be delineated to all the learners who will be part of this                 new program.                       Problem and Solution                           In Abueva, A. (2019), implementing the K-12 Program in the Philippine Curriculum of                 Basic  Education  was  the key  to  the growth  of  our  country.  Although  the  government  has                 faced  many  problems  as  it  implements  the  program  over  several  years,  it  has  been  a                 necessary improvement as it has been critical to the success of our nation to increase the                 quality of our education.","There were three main problem categories/themes including administrative related,                 teacher-related and student-related. The findings include:                    (a) Lack of trainings, seminars, unclear standard operating procedures,                 (b) Late arrival and lack of modules,                   (c) developing/weak teaching skills and strategies,                  (d) Teacher’s difficulty in teaching the subjects or contents,                 (e) Lack of time to tackle the content efficiently,                 (f) Unavailability or lack of instructional materials,                 (g) Non-mastery of the basic concepts and skills,                 (h) Poor problem solving and critical thinking skills                  (i) Indifferent student behavior.                          Also, the financial resource was a major problem for the schools with regard to the                 implementation of the K to 12 program.                           The  solutions  to  the  problem  include  sharing  of  modules  or  guides  and  more                 research work for the teacher. conducting cooperative learning class, giving extra time for                 research work, taking time in the preparation of the lesson, making use of the indigenous                 materials, reviewing basic concepts and giving examples, motivating and teaching students                 enthusiastically, since the teacher still found difficulty in handling classes or subject matters                  in relation to the implementation of the K to 12 curriculum in the Philippines,                  Recommendation                           We recommend that despite all the problems found as a result of the implementation                 of this new curriculum, many had believed that the long-term effects of the K to 12 program                  were very beneficial to all Filipino graduates. Therefore, support and encouragement for the                 betterment of the new educational system implemented by the government be shown by all","Filipinos.  By  investing  our  more  time  and  resources  to  education,  national  growth  and                 development can truly be achieved.
