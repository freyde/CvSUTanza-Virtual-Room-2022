                 ⊹     The word “assess” comes from the Latin verb

                       ‘assidere’ meaning ‘to sit with’. In assessment

                       one is supposed to sit with the learner. This
                       implies it is something we do with and for

                       students and not to student (Green, 1998)



                 ⊹     Assessment is the systematic basis for making

                       inferences about the learning and development
                       of students. It is the process of deﬁning,

                       selecting, designing, collecting, analyzing,
                       interpreting, and using information to increase

                       students' learning and development.

               The goal of formative assessment is to monitor student

               learning to provide ongoing feedback that can be used

               by instructors to improve their teaching and by students

               to improve their learning.




              Examples of formative assessments include;

              • Impromptu quizzes or anonymous voting (Kahoot
              and the like)

                         standard benchmark. Summative assessments are given to
                         students at the end of an instructional period. They are
                         evaluative rather than diagnostic and are used to measure
                         whether a course's learning objectives were met.

         assessment to evaluate a learner's level of language. It can be
         compared to informal assessment, which involves observing the

         learners' performance as they learn and evaluating them from the
         data gathered. Formal assessments are used when comparing

         students' knowledge to each other and when identifying students'
         strengths and weaknesses. Formal assessments conﬁrm the
         students' proﬁciency or mastery of the content, and might be used

         for comparisons against standards, standardized tests, criterion
         referenced tests.

         Examples of formal assessments include quiz, assignments, and live
         projects.
