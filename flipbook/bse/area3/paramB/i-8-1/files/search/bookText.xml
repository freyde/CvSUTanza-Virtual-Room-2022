               BSBM 1-1




                       The video presentation is about a man whose name is Pellegrino which means
               pilgrim. A pilgrim is a person who journeys to one place to another for various reasons.

               His name was given to him by his Italian parents. He also stated that as if his parents

               knew what he is going to do for the rest of his life. The reason why he travels across the
               world is to help people communicate better. He helps other people communicate with

               other nationalities. He said that in order to work with other nationalities and cross-cultural
               communication, you must take a look at yourself because it’s all about perception and

               understanding what people see. He has an Italian, British, and English accent inside him.
               He stated that during one of his travels, he encountered a problem about working with

               other nationalities. He said that people only want to see what they want to see, they don’t

               always see what you see. This means that they only accept what is familiar in their group.
               He told stories about different scenario in his life in which the problem about the culture

               is encountered. There will be a different meaning in a single phrase depending on the

               delivery of a  person. He  explained the cultures of different country. For example, the
               queuing in Norway is about equality. First come, first served is about equality. If we’re

               taken by surprise in that situation, we may jump into negative conclusions rather than the
               positive conclusions. People from different countries are doing the same things in different

               ways. The key to cross and navigate the borders between countries, nations, and cultures
               is curiosity. Curiosity is so important because it is the key to understanding each other.]]></page><page Index="33"><![CDATA[Khaila M. Diaz                                                                                     BSEE34

                                            Dead Stars by Paz Marquez Benitez


                       Dead Stars simply deals on human's weakness especially when one falls in love and that
               it will involve decision making. It is a game of love which nobody will win. The short story conveys

               the theme that pertains to a forbidden love which is focused on deciding between what your heart
               truly wants or to follow the mind of being loyal to your promise. “Dead Stars” was defined in the

               story as memories of the past which people sometimes look at for a while and realize that it has
               already been dead, already vanished. The story was told in the third person point of view. The

               author also used a lot of unfamiliar words and gave the whole story a “flowery tone”. However, it
               shows a sad tone to the whole story itself as the story symbolizes things that are present but are

               left unspoken. It is basically a compilation of the complicated circumstances that every man has
               to go through in life.


                       The story started in a slow easy pace with the introduction of the characters and their

               situations. This love triangle between the three and the reader’s anticipation for Alfredo’s to-be

               decision is the main excitement of the story or the climax of the story. The main character, Alfredo,
               is  faced  with  the  dilemma  of  man  versus  circumstance  which  he  needs  to  choose  between
               choosing Julia - a woman he knew for a short period of time - and choosing Esperanza - a woman

               he knew for years and whom he was engaged with. When Alfredo finally decided, the story’s

               excitement went back to its slow steady pace leading to the resolution. He finally chose to stay
               with his promise, remain loyal to his commitment and married Esperanza. The author also added

               a little twist in the ending of the story wherein Alfredo and Julia meet again after a long time and
               a bittersweet reunion scene between the two former lovers gave the story a sad impression.


                       The  decision  in  “what  ifs”  situations  in  the  story  is  clearly  explored.  The  story  also

               convincingly depicts the protagonist as a calm and collected man, a bachelor and dependent on
               what society will tell him. The story is very descriptive of its environment and of the character’s

               feelings, particularly Alfredo’s, yet also sensitive at the same time in a sense that the choice of

               words are appropriate which help in bringing out the literary elements that tie the story together.]]></page><page Index="34"><![CDATA[Name: Alvarez, Edilyn L.                                         Output No.2

                       The video talks about the works and the whole definition of literature. The
               speaker says that the literature or imaginative writing is the field of expression. Yet it’s

               true, for me imaginative writing comes from the inner part of emotion even imagination

               of one self. And it also express or deliver through writing. Literature is meaningful
               because even it takes so many years, the words written maybe preserve and last, our

               culture and history may be seen on it. On the other hand different language can be also
               use in literature. We as a reader can determine the feelings and thoughts of the writer

               by his/her works. He says also that “our world” our reality talks about nature, people,

               and their affair.

                       Through creative writing there is a freedom to speak, to tell, to chose and also to

               disapprove things. An extra ordinary way of expressing ourselves into words shapes the
               things that it expresses language. That’s why the language’s speaker tells us that this is

               always already a partial representation of reality.


                       Teaching literature help the teacher to educate children to become aware of

               linguistic, to appreciate not only history but also the culture, and motivate a child to read
               and write meaningful words beyond their limits. It is one of the useful accesses about

               the representation of reality and life.]]></page><page Index="35"><![CDATA[Ronnie Cuyos Daef

                       To be totally honest, I am not quite sure at first on how to write my reflection and




























               analysis paper regarding Dead Stars, as I go over the story, it’s kinda cliche to every love story






















               that we have heard, watched and seen on real life, however, I would say that still, at this time, or
               I should say in our generation, there are still lessons that can be picked from this love story.









                       I was disappointed at first with Alfredo knowing that he had a relationship with





               Esperanza for 4 years then he can still manage to cheat despite Esperanza being a perfect















               wife-material, I should say that, that is during their time.















                       In our generation now-a-days, cheating is not a new thing, and men will always be men.



               Finding the real one to be with us and grow old with us is hard to do, especially if that someone


















               is attracted not to you, but to others.


















                       I think this love story is kinda like a realization to this generation that we should not be

               distracted by the things that came like a wind and left like a wind. We should stand on our own


















               roots, we should settle on the strong foundation that was built over the years.








                       We might be facing difficulties in making decisions, especially in our romantic side, but

                       The video is all about “Cross-Cultural Communication”. This type of communication




















               deals with an understanding of how people from different cultures and places, talks, interact




               and communicate with each other. The speaker in the video given is Mr. Pellegrino Riccardi.

















               Mr. Pellegrino is a cross-cultural expert in which he shares his personal experience in


















               cross-cultural communication. He ​comes from both English and Italian backgrounds and lives










               in Norway at the moment. He also loves to travel so he technically has a lot of experience in








               terms of cross-cultural communication.












                       Mr. Pellegrino Riccardi talks a lot about perception. He says that it is all about















               perception and understanding what people see. His definition of culture is “a system of
                                                                                              ​














               behavior that helps us act in an accepted or familiar way". We are doing things that are



















               accepted and familiar in our place or culture but not all places have the same idea as yours.









               His example is about his experiences being an Italian in Norway. He says and explains that










               there are certain cultures and beliefs that Italians don’t accept and they are not familiar like





















               how Norwegians talk to other nationalities. We've got different ideas of acceptance and


               familiarity based on our nationality.




                       All countries are different. We are doing some same things but of course, in slightly



















               different ways. That’s why curiosity is important. He said that he is always a curious person.

















               Curiosity brings you through a whole lot of stuff. If you encounter other nationalities, you




















               can ask them, research about the country, so you can know anything. It is not bad to ask













               especially to those who love to travel around the world or planning to work outside the









               country. Watch your own words especially on talking to other nationalities because first of






               all, you don’t share the same culture so he /she has different beliefs.

                       Even you have different nationalities to others, it’s important that you know how to

                   CHARACTERS                He is Sir Charles’ playboy nephew, who is in-debt because of
                                               gambling. When he knew about his uncle’s secret plan, he also

                                             He  is  the  clumsy  police  inspector,  who  has  been  trying  to
                                               capture the mastermind of “The Phantom”.
                       GENRE                                   Comedy-mystery Film
                                        How it started?
                                            The story begins with young Princess Dala, receiving a gift from
                                        his  father  who  is  the  Maharajah  of  Lugash.  The  gift  is  the  largest
                                        diamond in the world with an unusual flaw that resembles a panther.
                                        In the present day, when the Maharaja died and the new government
                                        has  taken  over  the  power,  the  Pink  Panther  was  claimed  to  be  the
                                        people and the nation’s property. However, Princess Dala refuses to
                                        surrender it. The diamond has a huge value, so when the Princess went
                                        to  Cortina  d’Ampezzo,  the  mastermind  of  the  mysterious  thieving
                        PLOT            “The  Phantom”  planned  to  steal  the  diamond.  He  disguised  as
                                        trustworthy man and became friends with Princess Dala.
                                        The challenges or struggles encountered by the characters
                                            A  clumsy  police  inspector  named  Jacques  Clouseau  has  been
                                        following  the  case  of  “The  Phantom”,  however,  he  is  constantly
                                        outsmarted by him because of his wife, Simone. She is having an affair
                                        with its mastermind. Everything was planned but George, Sir Charles’
                                        playboy  nephew,  arrived  unexpectedly.  He  is  secretly  an  in-debt
                                        gambler  that  tries  to  seduce  the  Princess  and  even  Simone.  And
                                        became one of the reason, why the plan became chaotic.  When he]]></page><page Index="39"><![CDATA[knew about his uncle’s secret, he also attempted to steal the diamond
                                        and end up in prison with him.
                                        How it ended?
                                            Simone went to see Dala to help Sir Charles get out of the prison.
                        PLOT            The princess revealed that the diamond was stolen by her to avoid the
                        (cont.)         government for turning over the diamond. At the trial, the inspector
                                        was called as a witness of the defense. He was asked a lot of questions
                                        and suspects to him to be the Phantom. When he got nervous, he pulls
                                        his handkerchief showing the Pink Panther. The people thought that he
                                        was  the  Phantom,  so  they  are  thankful  of  him  from  stealing  the
                                        diamond to the Princess. Meanwhile, Sir Charles and George were free
                                        and planned to continue the legacy of the Phantom with Simone.
                                        Direction
                                            Edward Blake established himself as a vigorous talent that worked
                                        hard to  get every one of his films made. In fact, that on such film
                                        managed to land a place within the Library of Congress as part of the
                                        National Film Registry. That film was none other than the original
                                        Pink Panther. The Pink Panther is a British-American media franchise
                                        primarily focusing on a series of comedy-mystery films featuring an
                                        inept French police detective, Inspector Jacques Clouseau. This movie
                                        was a hit, but compared to the movies that we have right now, this is
                                        too  much  to  handle  especially  the  clumsiness  of  one  of  the  main
                                        character. But when it comes in portraying the events in the story, the
                                        ending was unpredictable that the one who chased first end up being
                    MECHANICS           in a prison.
                                            Compared  to  his  movie  Breakfast  at  Tiffany’s,  Edward  Blake
                                        alters the mood of the film, which romance hangs heavily in the air. In
                                        addition to a change of mood, the director also develops the events and
                                        also took an artistic license with the characters themselves, as well as
                                        their development. But both of the movies have a great impact in the
                                        film  industry  that  made  his  name  as  a  great  director.  His  movie
                                        Breakfast at Tiffany’s is more relatable where romance is in the air
                                        that’s why most of the viewers prefer it and that also applies to me.
                                        Cinematography
                                            The techniques that were used in the movie were very effective,
                                        especially in portraying the settings and the characters in the story. The
                                        ski resort where the background was ice that shows how the angle of
                                        the camera or the one who is taking the shot was good that the place
                                        captured beautifully.  And the other thing is the settings where every
                                        place has a significant meaning that gave a special effect in the story.]]></page><page Index="40"><![CDATA[And the other thing was in the house of the princess that symbolizes
                                        her wealth as the one who possess the Pink Panther.
                                        Writing
                                            In the movie Pink Panther, the script was acceptable that even
                                        though  it  is  a  comedy  movie  they  delivered  the  dialogue  well
                                        portraying  their  own  character.  Although  the  ending  was
                                        unpredictable, throughout the story was slow that keeps repeating the
                                        reigning  chaos  and  raging  lust  of  the  characters  in  the  story  that
                                        focusing more  on entertainment and laughs and less on story and plot.
                                        And one thing that made the story dull was the clumsy inspector that
                                        tripping  over  every  conceivable  object  antiquated  flat  joke  were
                                        getting old fast and not effective in this modern time.
                                        Editing
                                            The film was taken a long time ago so its editing is expected to be
                                        not as good or as high-tech on what we have right now in other movies.
                    MECHANICS           The film was edited by Ralph E. Winters. The Pink Panther idea was
                        (cont.)         chosen by Edwards from hundreds of sketches. Edward shot the film
                                        with multiple takes of improvised scenes. Peter Seller was originally a
                                        supporting actor and resulted in his continuation throughout the film.
                                        The scene in shooting the comedy part was not easy. He bumps into
                                        things. He tumbles blindly over door bills and edges of rugs. He walks
                                        clumsily into his own bedroom without sensing what's under his own
                                        bed. This scene needs to look normal to make it frenetically funny, and
                                        the shift from a scene to another makes it indeed humorous. The effects
                                        looks realistic.  This film has one of the industries greatest slow builds.
                                        The  comic  masterpiece  by  Blake  Edwards  well  introduced  the
                                        animated  Pink  Panther  character  in  the  film's  opening-and-closing
                                        credit sequences and actor Peter Sellers in his most renowned comic
                                        role as the inept Inspector Clouseau have the big help to build the story.
                                        This animated pink panther that occasionally appear in scenes is an
                                        iconic character that lasts up to this day. The influence of the great
                                        comics of the silent era on Edwards and Sellers is apparent throughout
                                        the film, which is recognized for its enduring popularity.
                                        Costume Design
                                            The  clothing  choices  fit  the  style  of  the  movie.  With  Claudia
                                        Cardinale playing Princess Dala whose father the Shah of Lugash, gifts
                                        her a pink Diamond as a child, the largest of its kind in the world, the
                                        glamour needed to be appropriate. She is shown in rather simple yet
                                        elegant dresses drawn in at the waist and including a figure hugging
                                        pencil skirt, classic pearls and fur hats, jeweled dresses, gold and silk]]></page><page Index="41"><![CDATA[drapery and styled  gowns. The wardrobe is also commendable like
                                        how Princess Dala’s clothes really fits for an Arabian princess. Also,
                                        other characters’ costumes like the Phantom, it gave a mysterious aura
                                        to the audience. Even the supporting casts really made an exceptional
                                        costumes appropriate to the scenes.
                                        Set Design
                                            The use of different places in this movie is very commendable as
                                        it adds up to the background story of the characters. The film was shot
                                        in Cortina d'Ampezzo, Rome and Rocca di Papa; Paris, France; and
                                        Los Angeles, U.S., using the flashback process. The weather in the set
                                        of Cortina d’Ampezzo matches the situation where Sir Charles had to
                                        help Princess Dala with her dog. The hotel that they stayed in was
                                        extraordinary because of the doorways that characters like Simone and
                                        Sir Charles can secretly go through each other’s room. The gathering
                                        where Dala usually go were fancy as it was. We can also observe how
                                        old the movie through its setting, just like the chase of police and the
                    MECHANICS           culprits of the diamond in the latter part of the story. Their effort in
                        (cont.)         using different sets is quite impressive as those places are very fancy
                                        and classy that really match the scenes.
                                        Score or Soundtrack
                                            We  can  observe  how  old  this  movie  is  through  the  use  of  its
                                        soundtrack. Despite the year produced, the introduction background
                                        music of opening theme in the movie is quite catchy. The repetition of
                                        the  beat  makes  it  easier  to  remember  and  to  hymn  with.  It  is  not
                                        surprising that the theme of this movie was nominated in the Oscar’s
                                        in  1965.  It  is  very  classic  of  the  movie  to  use  jazz-swing  music,
                                        especially in the scenes of the chase, mystery encounters, and thieving.
                                        Nowadays, some people might not appreciate these kinds of music as
                                        orchestra or classic taste are boring. But in this movie, despite its age,
                                        it still kicks into the audience to make it more exciting and interesting
                                        to watch.
                                        1. Does the film reflect on a current event or contemporary issues?
                                          It  could  be  the  director's  way  of  engaging  in  a  bigger
                                          conversation. Look for ways to relate the content of the film to
                                          the "real" world.
                      REVIEW                The  film  "The  Pink  Panther"  is  definitely  a  great  masterpiece
                                        showing  various  scenes  which  really  reflects  current  issues  in  the
                                        modern era. It totally showed different aspects that are very relevant
                                        in modern-day society. The film perfectly shows dimensions of being
                                        a human. As a matter of fact, after we have watched the movie, we list]]></page><page Index="42"><![CDATA[down the three core ideas of the film and these are; the lust for wealth,
                                        betrayal, and injustice.
                                            The first idea that film has is the lust for wealth which some people
                                        may  be  addressed  to  Princess  Dala.  She  has  the  possession  of  the
                                        diamond  which  was  given  by  her  father.  The  precious  and  very
                                        expensive diamond that claims to be the property of the people but
                                        Dala refuses to relinquish it to the government. In the modern day,
                                        Dala can be a resemblance of the former first lady Imelda Marcos who
                                        owned  a  lot  of  jewels  which  declared  as  ill-gotten  wealth  of  the
                                        Marcoses that should be turned over to the government because it’s for
                                        the people. Second idea shown by the film that we can all relate to is
                                        betrayal or the ability of humans to deceive others for his/her own sake.
                                        Simone  betrayed  her  own  husband  Jacques  Clouseau  for  having  a
                                        secret affair with Sir Charles Lytton. In addition, Simone offers Dala
                                        by  taking  possession  of  the  diamond  and  decides  to  help  out  Sir
                                        Charles and George. Simone and Princess Dala hatch a plan to frame
                                        Clouseau. Simone is an example of the sad reality nowadays, because
                                        like her there are people who have the guts to betray and fool their own
                                        partner. The last idea present in the film is the dark side of justice. We
                                        knew that because of the poor justice system especially in our country
                      REVIEW            there are innocent people convicted and put in jail. Many innocent
                        (cont.)         lives were wasted because justice can be manipulated. Moreover, the
                                        sad reality in this contemporary world that justice is only for the rich.
                                        2.  Does the film seem to have a message, or does it attempt to elicit
                                           a specific response or emotion from the audience? You could
                                           discuss whether or not it achieves its own goals.
                                            Actually, when the film starts, we thought it may be so boring
                                        until  the  end,  because  of  not  so  good  cinematography  in  terms  of
                                        transition, sound effects and graphics. On the other hand, when the
                                        film goes on, it gradually hooks our attention because of the characters,
                                        especially the clumsy inspector named Jacques Clouseau. The clumsy
                                        and  awkward  personality  of  the  inspector  catches  us  because
                                        throughout  the  film  he  made  comedic  ambiance  surpassing  dull
                                        moments. The film is definitely interesting and highly recommended
                                        to watch because of its superb power to entertain the viewers. Its strong
                                        tone and mode are absolutely appealing that can hit the emotion of the
                                        viewers and it will give a memorable experience to them. As a matter
                                        of fact, one of the favorite parts of our group in the film is in the living
                                        room wherein Simone does her best to help Charles and George hide
                                        just to keep their secret love affair from Jacques. This scene was totally]]></page><page Index="43"><![CDATA[intense and nerve-wracking that keeps us nailed in our seats without
                                        blinking  our  eyes.  In  addition,  indeed,  this  scene  was  the  most
                                        memorable part in the film.
                                            With  regards  to  the  message,  the  film  achieved  its  goals  to
                                        entertain the viewers while highlighting its valuable message. One of
                                        its messages is that we should be careful and think a million times in
                                        every  action  we  take,  because  we  don't  know  its  consequences.
                                        Moreover,  be  careful  of  trusting  anyone,  because  sometimes  the
                                        person who you truly trust the most may betray and deceive you. The
                                        saddest thing about betrayal is that it never comes from your enemies
                                        and sometimes the person you'd take a bullet for is standing behind the
                                        trigger.
                                        3. Does the film connect with you on a personal level? You could
                                          write a review stemming from your own feelings and weave in
                                          some personal stories to make it interesting for your readers.
                                            After we have watched the film, our group made a conversation
                                        just to know the personal viewpoints of each and everyone. Did the
                                        film relate to one of our groupmates' personal experiences? All of us
                      REVIEW            share our personal story that is similar or has relevance to the film.
                        (cont.)         After our group conversation, we decided to use as an example the
                                        personal story of one of our groupmates which has resemblance to the
                                        film.  His  story  was  all  about  betrayal  and  infidelity  just  like  what
                                        Simone did to Jacques Clouseau. His father has a secret love affair
                                        with a widowed woman who lived beside their house. He was totally
                                        angry at his father, because his mother didn't know the betrayal of his
                                        father. He witnessed how his father woke up in the middle of the night
                                        just to sneak in the neighboring house. He also saw the actual showing
                                        of affection of his father to the woman. But even though he already
                                        knew the dark secrets of his father, he didn't attempt to tell all of these
                                        to his mother because all he wants is a complete and happy family.
                                        One  time,  his  mother  and  father  made  a  confrontation  because  his
                                        mother caught his father once sneaking to the neighboring house. His
                                        father starts making alibis just to please and fool his mother. The story
                                        ends. This story of our group mate is one of the saddest realities that
                                        happens nowadays. Betrayal is the most devastating loss a person can
                                        experience  like  what  happened  to  Jacques  Clouseau.    The  most
                                        damaging aspect of abuse is the trauma to our hearts and souls from
                                        being betrayed by the people that we love and trust. As an individual,
                                        we should always keep the trust that was given to us, because trust
                                        takes years to build, seconds to break, and forever to repair.]]></page><page Index="44"><![CDATA[Name: ESTUR, CRESTEL CYLAH A.                                               Section: BSE-E 1-1

                                    Reflection Paper: The Miracle Worker by Helen Keller




                       “I need a teacher as much as Helen, I need help too.” That is one of Anne Sullivan said
               on the movie entitled The Miracle Worker by Helen Keller. The movie expresses matters of the

               heart, mind and soul with a vision towards hope.

                       On the first part of the story, there is a child named Helen, she is a blind and deaf daughter

               of Kate and Captain Arthur Keller. Helen became deaf and blind when she suffers a terrible fever
               when she was a couple of months old. She had given a last chance to learn before they will send
               her in an asylum (a kind of mental facility for persons with disability) that is why they hired a

               teacher who also from Perkins School for the Blind to teach Helen how to communicate. As Anne
               (the teacher, half blind) saw Helen on her first day when she arrived on their house, she tried to
               observe Helen just to make sure that she will cooperate. As her first lesson, she taught her how

               to spell “doll” and “cake” with the use of hands (sign language for deaf people). She also taught
               her how to use a spoon to eat and how to fold a napkin. As the day passed by, Anne made a deal
               for Mr. and Mrs. Keller to give her a couple of weeks to teach Helen and to make her understand

               the  idea  that  everything  has  a  name  and  everything  has  its  purpose.  She  gave  Helen  an
               opportunity  to  hold  a  hatching  chicken  egg.  “Helen,  the  chick  has  to  come  out  of  its  shell

               sometime.” Anne wanted to tell that we should learn how to be brave despite of our disabilities
               and/or weaknesses. In the story, Anne represents hope while the Keller family represents the
               failure. “Ms. Keller, I don’t think Helen’s worst handicap is deafness or blindness. I think it’s your

               love and pity. You’re so sorry for her you’ve kept her like a pet. Even a dog you housebreak.” –
               Anne Sullivan said towards Mr. and Mrs. Keller when they talked to Anne after the dinner scene.

               And soon, Anne taught Helen her first word “wa-wa” or simply “water” while they are on the water
               pump outside the house and placed Helen’s hand under the spout. And as she felt the water
               continuously flows on her hands, she learned how to spell “water” slowly.]]></page><page Index="45"><![CDATA[As I have done watching the movie, I learned that the teaching profession is not that easy.
               It takes time to know a lot of things and they give us idea how strong does a teacher should

               possess, how to fight whatever problem may we will encounter, learn how to grow, and face our
               fears. Just like what Steve Jobs said, “The only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe
               is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do.” If we don’t have any

               courage, we cannot reach our desired destination.]]></page></pages></Search>
