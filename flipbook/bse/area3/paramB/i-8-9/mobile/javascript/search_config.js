The focus of this documentary               is the relevance and roles that a SPED Teacher plays in the lives               of students with special needs. It is also about a SPED teacher               and her enthusiasm and perseverance in teaching students with               special needs. This documentary emphasizes the importance of               a SPED teacher in the growth and development of students with              special needs. It also emphasizes the improvements that                occurred for students with special needs as a result of the SPED              teacher’s help and guidance, as well as the accommodations               and adjustments that they implemented in teaching.","PREPRODUCTION                     Since we were assigned to the documentary, we immediately held a meeting              to discuss what we needed to do and who would be in charge of each task.               We planned who would be involved in each task, such as scriptwriters,              researchers, editors, videographers, and, of course, the host. As a researcher,               we are responsible for locating a special needs child who will serve as our              subject for this documentary. But, no matter how hard we try, we can’t find a               subject, so our director decided that we could assist everyone in finding our              subject because we need to find it right away because the day is running out.              We had a group in the documentary that could have seen a subject, but the               child’s parents were unfamiliar and refused to make his child the subject, so              we were all disappointed because there were only a few days left and we still               couldn’t find a subject. Our next meeting will still be about the tasks we need              to complete as soon as possible, and luckily, our director found a subject, so              we made our work a little easier because we already had one. Our director               also mentioned during our meeting that he was able to talk about our subject              as well as his parents. He also took additional footage of the child’s school. We               scheduled a day to film at the child’s school and to interview our subject              teacher, Ma’am Stephanie. We have prepared some questions for teacher               Stephanie in order to clarify some of the potential questions in our              documentary. We made sure that the videographers could capture the               important videos we could use from outside the school to inside. A heavy rain              fell in the middle of our filming, as if we weren’t permitted to make a              documentary. We continued despite the fact that it was pouring heavily and               we were soaked because we knew it was part of the challenge. We also had              many repeat take on videos and other epic moments, but we kept going. After               we finished filming, the editors who edited it found it difficult to edit because              there were videos that didn’t match what could have happened until we had a               difficult time editing, and our director assisted with the editing. We also had              difficulty playing our documentary because the draft video was shown               because our final video could not be downloaded immediately.","SCRIPT","","","PRODUCTION                    June 6 this year we take the video for our documentary after the long process of              submitting the letters for our subject consent and also the signature of our city mayor we              manage to get the final date of our final video taking at first we meet in Dasmarinas Bayan              because more of our group members is came from Tanza, Trece, Maragondon, and Manila              so we start our day very early after we complete my member we started discussing what              we are going to do we don’t have time to talk each other because every time is precious              that time because our target to finished our documentary is 6pm after the meeting we all              agreed that we came first in school and have a initial interview with Ma’am Stephanie by              10pm we finished it and we take some video clips that we can use in editing we finished              over all exactly at 11:30 pm and by that time we are going to nearest McDo in our city to by              our lunch because we don’t have time to cook anything after we eat luch we decided to go               in our children subject which is Jhuvann we talak with her sister and her mother but her              mother is in a hurry because his mother will going to market for their business that’s why              his older sister are the one who has time for interview but we make sure that her sister              answer is guided by her mother. And at last, we finished to take videos and our interview              the next thing we do is to buy cake for Teacher Stephanie just for appreciation because              she let us to have time to interview her. And in Jhuvann I bake him a cookie that is good in              his health I ask her ate what food is right for him ang she helps me in baking it and as the              times goes by we are all done exactly at 5pm that’s why every participants in our              Documentaries came home early and not late.","POSTPRODUCTION                    As part of Editor team for our documentary one of the hardest part for me and to              my partner is to find the video clips that we need for our documentary, because              some of the video clips are not rename in properly so as editor I have no choice and               to start video editing so I need to watch it one by one and to finish editing I suggest              my partner she starting editing for other part and I watch one by one the video clips              then I rename it properly and the other video that we the voice over I edit and I               send to my partner. And being editor we make sure the video is presentable for the              audience, but it not easy to do that because sometimes I don\&#39;t no how to              insert the clips and the voice over that we need for our documentary. Also for              transition we don\&#39;t no what transition that we need to use it and as of part              editor the hardest I've experience when I edit the video when I experience a little bit               technical problems but to the help of my partner it easy to finish our documentary              that why I\&#39;m so thankful to have a partner for editing video. Also I\&#39;m              thankful too to have cooperative               documentary team.","TAKEAWAYS                      When it was announced that we would be making a documentary, I was both thrilled and              nervous, as well as I was shocked to learn that I would be a part of the documentary team;              I wanted to object, but I didn’t have a choice, so I just accepted it. I even volunteered to be              one of the scriptwriters. I initially believed that being a scriptwriter was a simple job, but it              is not. I was given the task of writing four letters of request to be given to the subjects as              well as those important people who we need to obtain permission to film our              documentary. As a scriptwriter, I helped the director generate the flow of our              documentary. I also encountered some difficulties in writing the script. It’s because I need              to make sure that the words I use are understandable and not offensive. However, I              overcame those challenges and am grateful for the new experiences I have gained. Yes, it’s              true that producing a documentary is difficult, but it is also true that producing a              documentary will provide you with remarkable experiences              and lessons. Making this documentary has provided me with new learnings that I may              apply in the future, and hearing their story has inspired me as a person and educator.                 While making this documentary, I realized a lot of things, such as how there are still              teachers who will do anything to get the attention of their students with special needs. The              sacrifices made by teacher Stephanie for her students were unique. Even though teaching              in a regular classroom is difficult, teaching children with special needs is even more difficult              because they require more double nurturing, double attention, and so on.              EXPERIENCE It’s my first time working with my classmates who became my group in the              documentary; I’ve gained a lot of experience while working on this documentary, and I can              say that I don’t regret joining this team because we worked well together. Will go to any              length to ensure that our documentary is beautiful and orderly                Documentary Team and I realized a lot, specially to those teachers whom been an angel to              serve and teach those childrens who has special needs, they are so patience. They deserve              everything they have because they worked hard on it. I pray that God will give them              strength to continue what they're doing, to be a blessing in people.
