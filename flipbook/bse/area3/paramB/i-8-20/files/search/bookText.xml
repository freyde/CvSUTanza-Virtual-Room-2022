               Introduction

                       The  church  ought  to be where a body of people bear with one another and carry one
               another's burdens. The church is called to display unity and peace. All of this is meant to be so
               regardless of ethnicity, socioeconomic status, gender, etc. However, there are many problems
               and issues that arouse the public's attention in the community when it comes between Gender
               and the Churches. Some of these are church governance and leadership; churches engaging
               with  gender  equity;  churches  responding  to  gender  in  the  home  and  society;  horny  ethical
               issues related to sexuality and reproductive choices; and the issue of same-sex marriage. All of
               these  topics  are  debatable;  however, this case analysis  will focus on the issue of Same-Sex
               Marriage, which is the process of unification of two people of the same sex that was unaccepted
               by the majority, especially by the people in the church. The increasing number of people who
               are open and interested in this issue is one of the reasons why it has become internationally
               controversial. As a result, many countries, particularly in Western Europe and the United States,
               legalized  same-sex  marriage. However, most  countries  don't  recognize  the  reformation  of
               marriage in their Constitution, including the Philippines, because many Filipinos are Christians
               who believe that marriage is a sacred union of man and woman only.



               Background

                       The Philippines is a country whose belief in marriage is mostly in lined with morals and
               cultural aspects where a majority of its principles were taught through Christianity. Marriage, as
               stated in Art. 1 of the Family Code is a special contract of permanent union between a man and
               a  woman  entered  into  in  accordance  with  the  law.  It’s  clearly  stipulated  in  the  mentioned
               provision that only a man and a woman can enter into a valid marriage ceremony. This definition
               has been the roots of all arguments, debates and controversies because of the acceptance of
               the Filipinos to the rise of LGBTQ+ community or the “third-sex” society and the raising of the
               issue on equal protection clause and their equal right to marry, and conjugal rights.

                       Same sex marriage is the practice of marriage between two people of the same gender.
               In  the  late twentieth century, debates about the legalization of same-sex marriage around the
               world  have  been  publicly  noticeable  in  view  of  the  strong  opposition  of  Christianity  as  they
               consider it as morally wrong. On one hand, some scholars have argued that same-sex unions
               were  recognized  by  the  Roman  Catholic  Church  in  medieval  Europe,  although  others  have
               disputed this claim. Scholars and the general public became increasingly interested in the issue
               during the late 20th century, a period when attitudes toward homosexuality and laws regulating
               homosexual behavior were liberalized, particularly in Western Europe and the United States. In
               the  year  2000,  as  research  shows,  Netherlands  granted  religious rites of marriage and legal
               recognition to LGBTQ+ Community. In light of its decision, 20 other countries legalized marriage
               for same sex couples. Though few more countries are in the process of assessing legitimizing]]></page><page Index="28"><![CDATA[same sex marriage, still, majority of these countries doesn’t recognized reformation of marriage
               in their Constitution, and this include the Philippines.

                       The  Philippines  is  a  predominantly  Christian  country,  from  which  morality  and
               Christianity  has  always been an influence in the society. This has been the core reason why
               being a conservative individual matters for Filipino, especially one that involves marriage. As a
               matter of discussion, there are house bills regarding same sex marriage has been introduced in
               the Philippine laws such as: House Bill No. 6595, House Bill No. 3179. In 2011, there was a bill
               filed  to  amend  Article  26  of  the  Philippine  Family  Code,  to  prohibit  “forbidden  marriages.”
               Specifically, this sought to bar the Philippines from recognizing same-sex marriages contracted
               overseas. However, these bills did not advance.



               Evaluation of the Case

                       The Philippines is principally a Christian country, particularly a Roman Catholic nation.
               Although  there  is  a  separation  of  the  church  and  the  state,  lawmakers  of  the  Philippines
               consider deriving morals from the Bible in legislating law. The main focus of this case analysis is
               the  issue  of  the  legalization  of  same-sex  marriage  in  our  country.  The  religious  principles,
               culture and social acceptance, and marriage provisions of the Family Code of the Philippines
               were  the main hindrances that dismissed the petition of the LGBTQ+ community. This is the
               reason  why  as  of  now,  the  Philippines  does  not  recognize same-sex marriages between its
               citizens and still has a solid and ongoing debate regarding the legality of marriage for same-sex
               couples.

                               If  the  government  legalizes  same-sex  marriage,  it  will violate the majority's religious
               freedom and long-held morals. According to the Holy Bible, homosexuality is considered a sin
               as stated in the book of Leviticus 18:22 "Do not have sexual relations with a man as one does
               with  a  woman;  that  is  detestable.” This means that same-sex marriage is unrighteous in the
               eyes  of  the  Lord.  It  goes  against  His  intended  design  for us, for a man and a woman to be
               united  in  holy  matrimony.  According  to  Mark  10:6-9, saying, "But at the beginning of creation
               God' made them male and female. For this reason, a man will leave his father and mother and
               be united with his wife, and the two will become one flesh. So they are no longer two, but one
               flesh. Therefore what God has joined together, let no one separate."

                          Sadly, there are countries legally recognizing same-sex marriage like the Netherlands,
               the USA, Iceland, etc. Same-sex marriage devalues traditional marriage and family. Why should
               the law, our morals, tradition and nature be altered to fit something not normal? Conforming to
               what  is  trending  does  not  mean  conforming to what is wrong. Purely, equality is the primary
               concern raised by the LGBTQ+ community of wanting to legalize same-sex marriage. Aren't we
               practicing equality already? They are human too,  meaning they are included in the practice of
               human  rights,  especially  the  right  to  be  married,  provided  that  it  is  with  the  opposite  sex.
               Enabling law redefining and changing the parties who may contract marriage is only beneficial
               to  the  citizens  of  a  same-sex  relationship.  Father  Marcos Gonzales once said, "The Church]]></page><page Index="29"><![CDATA[says that homosexuals should be treated with love and respect but redefining the natural and
               divine institution of marriage is simply something we are not able to do." If man were to change
               the  true  essence  of  marriage  and  family,  which  is  the  basic  unit  of  the society, what would
               happen to the Philippines?

               Proposed Solution/Changes

                       The  stances  of  faith  on  same-sex  marriage  issues  of  different  religions  such  as
               Buddhism,  Islam,  Reform  Judaism,  and  Hinduism  in  general,    there  is  no  rule  or  formal
               ordination process for the LGBTQ+ community but usually requires years of study. As of now,
               the Philippines does not recognize same-sex relationships or same-sex marriages between its
               citizens. The solution we come up with to these debated topics for the sake of rights and benefit
               in the eyes of the law is to adopt the civil union in the Philippines. A civil union is legal protection
               to  the  couple  only at the state level. It is a marriage-like legal status, currently only issued to
               new  couples  in  a  few  states  like  Colorado,  Hawaii,  Illinois,  and  New  Jersey.  Originally
               established  to  provide  many  of  the  same  protections  that  marriage  offers  to  same-sex  and
               heterosexual couples.

                       Civil unions often share the same protections as marriages in states where they are still
               issued or recognized. When the spouse dies, the Estate Planning can inherit all of its assets
               without  incurring  taxes.  The  employment  -  can  be  covered  by  the  spouse's  employment
               benefits,  such  as  health  insurance,  and  have  the  right  to  bereavement  leave  if  the  spouse
               passes away. The healthcare - may have the right to make medical decisions on behalf of the
               spouse  and  have  unlimited  visitation privileges if they are sick. The parental rights, both may
               share  joint  parental  rights  over  your  children.  The  property  -  may  co-own  property  as  joint
               owners  and  have  the  right  of  survivorship if one spouse passes away. The separation  - can
               seek alimony if your civil union is dissolved. The spousal privilege - cannot be forced to testify
               against the spouse in court. The taxes  - can file state taxes jointly. (Though federal taxes still
               have to be filed separately.) While these rights are the same in marriage, the primary difference
               is that civil union partners are only guaranteed these protections within the state. A civil union
               does not entitle a couple to the federal benefits that only marriage can provide


               Conclusion and Recommendations

                       The  researchers  found  that  same-sex  marriage  is  only  beneficial  to  the  citizens of a
               same-sex relationship. Although many Filipino citizens willingly accept the relationship of same-
               sex couples, the probability that same-sex marriage will be allowed here in the Philippines is, for
               now,  highly  impossible.  One  main  reason  is  that  the  Philippines  is  a  Catholic  country,  and
               legalizing  same-sex  marriage  weakens  and  contradicts  the  teachings  and  doctrines  of  the
               Church, which defines marriage as a union between a man and a woman. Another reason is
               that it would ruin the concept of a family. In a typical setup, a family is composed of a father, a
               mother, and a child or children. On the bright side, the Philippines is not closing its doors to the]]></page><page Index="30"><![CDATA[changes that may happen shortly. Especially since the Filipino citizens always go with what we
               call "uso" or trending.

                       Therefore,  the  researchers  recommend  that  the  citizen  of the Philippines read this to
               consider  the  disadvantages  and  advantages  of  the  adoption  of  same-sex  marriage.  The
               legislators should also make the definition of marriage and equal rights in our constitution clear
               to avoid confusion and conflict involving the rights and privileges of the people.   It should also
               be followed by the proper interpretation of the judiciary. In addition to this we recommend that
               the  government  and  legislators  should  consider  passing  civil  unions  instead  of  same-sex
               marriage. Civil unions and marriages have similar definitions. A civil union is a legal relationship
               between two people that provides legal protection to the couple at the state level. If a couple is
               in  a  civil union they get inheritance rights, employment benefits, property, parental rights, and
               more.  Also,  the  Philippines  should  indeed  be  a  gender-fair  society  except  for  same-sex
               marriage. We and the researchers are in favor of same-sex union but not same-sex marriage.

                       Education was the most essential tool for everyone to  become successful in life. It

               encouraged  everyone  to  step  forward  and  excel  in  creating  positive  effects  where

               recognition and achievement can be acquired. Filipino graduates with previously 10 years of


               basic education, have been criticized in terms of their level of competency. Thus, Philippines

               have  adopted  the  K  to  12  curriculum  to  address  the  problem.  The  adoption  of  the  new

               curriculum is said to enhance the quality of basic education in the country. Furthermore, it

               will help students to be prepared when facing the demands of the 21st century. This is in fact

               in  line  with  Article  XIV,  Section  2(1)  of  the  1987  Philippine  Constitution  which  states  that

               “The  State  shall  establish,  maintain,  and  support  a  complete,  adequate,  and  integrated

               system of education relevant to the needs of the people and society.”



                       When  people  heard  news  of  the  K-12  program  implementation  in  the  country,  it

               received mixed reactions. Suddenly, there was a combination of backlashes and praise in


               the  background  with  the  students  left  puzzled  on  whose  voice  to  listen  to.  There  are  still

               challenges and standards of quality to consider but the important thing is to establish that

               development is present as a result of the new program.



                       K  stands  for  kindergarten  and  12  refers  to  the  succeeding  12  years  of  basic

               education, which is why it is called K to 12. The 12 years of basic education comprises of 6

               years  of  elementary  education,  4  years of  junior  high  school,  and  2  years  of  senior  high

               school. The K-12 program offers a 12-year program for the students which aim to give them


               sufficient  time  to  master  skills  and  acquire  basic  competencies  with  the  goal  of  being

               competitive on a global scale. Students of the new system will be equipped with the skills

               required to be ready for employment, entrepreneurship, middle-level skills development, and

               higher education even if they intend to do so after graduation.

                       K to 12 programs has been implemented by the Department of Education throughout

               the whole country. Five years ago, the Philippines was the only country in Southeast Asia]]></page><page Index="35"><![CDATA[that provided just 10 years of basic education to its population but ever since the K to 12

               implementations, the country has joined its neighbors in adopting an education system that

               will provide more opportunities to students on a global scale.




               Background of Study



                       The K to 12 Program covers kindergarten and 12 years of basic education ( six years

               of  primary  education,  four  years  of  junior  high  school,  and  two  years  of  senior  high

               school(SHS) to provide sufficient time for mastery of concepts and skills, develop lifelong

               learners,  and  prepare  graduates  for  tertiary  education,  middle-level  skills  development,

               employment and entrepreneurship.



                       According to President Benigno S. Aquino III, “We need to add two years to our basic

               education. Those who can afford pay up to fourteen years of schooling before university.

               Thus, their children are getting into the best universities and the best jobs after graduation. I


               want  at  least  12  years  for  our  public  school  children  to  give  them  an  even  chance  at

               succeeding.” Cognizant of this urgent and critical concern and in line with the priorities of the

               Aquino  Administration,  the  Department  of  Education  is  taking  bold  steps  to  enhance  the

               basic  education  curriculum.  Hand  in  hand  with  vigorous  efforts  to  address  the  input

               shortages, DepEd intends to raise the quality of basic education through the enhancement of


               the  curriculum  and  the  expansion  of  the  basic  education  cycle.  (DepEd,  2010).  The

               Commission  on  Higher  Education  (CHED)  believes  that  senior  high  will  be  college  ready

               regardless  of  the  track  while  the  Technical  Education  and  Skills  Development  Authority

               (TESDA) will provide Certificate of Completion (COC) or NCI after grade 10 and NC II after

               grade 12, which will improve employability in fields of agriculture, electronics and trade.



                       The new curriculum allows students to choose between three tracks which are the

               Academic, Technical-Vocational-Livelihood, and the Sports and Arts strand]]></page><page Index="36"><![CDATA[Starting with Kindergarten as the foundation for lifelong learning and development, the 12-

               year curriculum aims to give students the journey in education that they deserve. Foreign

               countries perceive that a ten-year curriculum in the education department is insufficient that

               is  why  many Filipinos abroad  are  not  recognized  professionals.  With  the  new  curriculum,


               graduates are fully equipped with the skills which can help them stand out on a global scale

               and compete accordingly according to international standards.

               The government implemented the K to 12 programs to enhance the educational system of

               the  country  in  order  to  accelerate  the  mutual  recognition  of  Filipino  graduates  and

               professionals across the world. Learners were able to master the skills and develop core


               competencies which are the essential things to meet the demand of the global market. This

               analysis used a systematic approach and review design to come up with a general idea that

               answers the main objectives of this research review. This research specifically looked into

               the different perspectives of the teachers, parents and students on the implementation of the

               K-12 program in the Philippines which added two more years before a student can proceed

               to college. It also described the various problems that arise as a result of the implementation

               of this new program and the action plans established by the government to address these


               issues. Moreover, to make possible recommendations that help improve the curriculum to

               make sure that quality education can be delineated to all the learners who will be part of this

               new program.







               Problem and Solution



                       In Abueva, A. (2019), implementing the K-12 Program in the Philippine Curriculum of

               Basic  Education  was  the key  to  the growth  of  our  country.  Although  the  government  has

               faced  many  problems  as  it  implements  the  program  over  several  years,  it  has  been  a

               necessary improvement as it has been critical to the success of our nation to increase the

               quality of our education.]]></page><page Index="37"><![CDATA[There were three main problem categories/themes including administrative related,

               teacher-related and student-related. The findings include:



                (a) Lack of trainings, seminars, unclear standard operating procedures,

               (b) Late arrival and lack of modules,


                (c) developing/weak teaching skills and strategies,

                (d) Teacher’s difficulty in teaching the subjects or contents,

               (e) Lack of time to tackle the content efficiently,

               (f) Unavailability or lack of instructional materials,

               (g) Non-mastery of the basic concepts and skills,

               (h) Poor problem solving and critical thinking skills

                (i) Indifferent student behavior.


                       Also, the financial resource was a major problem for the schools with regard to the

               implementation of the K to 12 program.



                       The  solutions  to  the  problem  include  sharing  of  modules  or  guides  and  more

               research work for the teacher. conducting cooperative learning class, giving extra time for

               research work, taking time in the preparation of the lesson, making use of the indigenous

               materials, reviewing basic concepts and giving examples, motivating and teaching students

               enthusiastically, since the teacher still found difficulty in handling classes or subject matters


               in relation to the implementation of the K to 12 curriculum in the Philippines,


               Recommendation



                       We recommend that despite all the problems found as a result of the implementation

               of this new curriculum, many had believed that the long-term effects of the K to 12 program


               were very beneficial to all Filipino graduates. Therefore, support and encouragement for the

               betterment of the new educational system implemented by the government be shown by all]]></page><page Index="38"><![CDATA[Filipinos.  By  investing  our  more  time  and  resources  to  education,  national  growth  and
