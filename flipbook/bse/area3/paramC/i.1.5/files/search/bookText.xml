               General Instruction:
                   •  This exam will be held via Google Meet.
                   •  Each student will be given 15 minutes to answer 5 randomly selected questions from

                       the topics covered.
                   •  The exam will be held on the students’ respective schedules.


               Answer/Do the following:
                   1.  Draw the model for 7 point geometry. (10 points)

                   2.  Discuss the process of creating a model for 7 point geometry.
                   3.  Given (A,B;C,D)=1/4. Find the following cross ratio:

                          •  (B,A;D,C)
                          •  (D,C;A,B)
                          •  (A,B;D,C)

                          •  (A,C;B,D)
                          •  (B,D;A,C)

                   4.  Given the figure  below, identify  1  complete  quadrangle  and  determine  its  vertices,
                       sides,  opposite  sides,  diagonal  point  and  diagonal  triangle  associated  with  the
                       identified quadrangle.
