           Why do you think Chaucer wrote in the vernacular of the time he wrote his works                *  2 points
           especially The Canterbury Tales?




               Most important works were written in Latin and French, and using the common vernacular made his
               work more accessible to everyday people.

               Chaucer's work was less formal, making it more reader friendly.


               Chaucer's work was meant to be taught to teenagers in school, so he wanted to make the language
               easy to understand.

               Before Chaucer's time, everyone wrote in French, which made reading di cult if you did not
               understand French.








           The Canterbury Tales is probably Chaucer's most famous work. It is likely that Chaucer         *  2 points
           had the ability to write about all of the different included characters because:




               Chaucer came from a very wealthy family and was well educated in the careers and lives of others.

               Chaucer did extensive research on each of the different characters in the Canterbury Tales by doing
               each of their jobs for a year.

               Chaucer did many different jobs, traveled, studied, and had many friends of different backgrounds to
               give him context.


               Chaucer had a very vivid imagination and could estimate how other people lived their lives with
               some certainty.

           A helpful hint for understanding Middle English is _____. *                                      2 points




               Look for words that sound the same as modern day English.


               Use a French dictionary, since many of the words are of French origin


               Write down the words to see if they share any letter combinations with modern day English words

               Avoid using contextual clues, since the meanings of our words are very different from the words that
               Chaucer uses








           Which of the following BEST explains the frame narrative of The Canterbury Tales               *  2 points
           presented in the  Prologue?




               A group of nuns tell stories of their childhood while seated within Canterbury Cathedral.

               A group of travelers tell stories to the Archbishop of Canterbury, competing to see who can entertain
               him the most.


               A group of pilgrims traveling to Canterbury tell stories to impress their host, who will reward his
               favorite pilgrim with a free dinner/meal.


               A group of whores tell stories about their various clients in and around Canterbury.








           Why do you think scholars believe that The Canterbury Tales are likely unfinished? *             2 points




               Chaucer died at a relatively young age.

               In the Prologue, the frame narrative suggests that each pilgrim will tell two tales, but fewer tales are
               told.


               In the General Prologue, the frame narrative suggests that each pilgrim will tell ten tales, but fewer
               tales are told.


               Most of the available manuscripts of The Canterbury Tales are fragmentary.
