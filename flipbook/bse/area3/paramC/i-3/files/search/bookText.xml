               Title:   Virtual Teachers’ Orientation and Capability Enhancement Seminar Workshop


               Rationale

                       The Higher Education 4.0 trends and future perspectives for teaching and learning are
               equally affected by the rapid changes we are facing today. These trends are significant to meet
               the future needs and challenges in education through the pervasive application of Information and
               Communication Technology (ICT).  In addition, the emergence of COVID-19 pandemic and the
               imminent presence of different COVID-19 variants (Delta) brought unforeseen disruptions in
               the lives of people all over the world.  The Philippine higher education institutions (HEIs) are
               no exemption in facing such critical situations.  To ensure the continuity of learning among
               tertiary students while avoiding and/or limiting the risks of infection in the community, HEIs
               explored and shifted to other innovative learning modalities that transmigrate the conduct of
               classes  from  traditional  to  flexible  learning  modalities,  which  gave  students  the  option  to
               choose the most convenient delivery modes to them.  This flexible learning modality emerged
               during the First Semester of Academic Year 2020–2021 where it was used for the conduct of
               lecture classes, leaving behind the conduct of laboratory classes that require a more rigid
               training for students in face-to-face classes.

                       As CvSU Tanza increases its enrolment during the First Semester of AY 2021 – 2022, from
               1,154 students last year now caters a projected 1700 enrollees, thus compelling the campus to
               hire additional faculty members. With this, there is an urgent need to conduct faculty orientation
               and re-orientation and further explore other innovative flexible learning modalities that suit the
               capacity, capability, and connectivity of our teachers and learners.

               Objectives
                       The activity aims to provide our faculty members with additional information and enhance
               different ways on  flexible  learning  modality of education delivery  with  the aid of  ICT and new
               technologies.


               Implementation
                       The Campus Administrator together with all faculty members will attend the said activity on
               September 2 – 3, 2021 from 1:00pm to 5:00pm via Zoom/WebEx.]]></page><page Index="5"><![CDATA[Program of Activities
