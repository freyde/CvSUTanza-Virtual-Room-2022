Pilgrims will tell stories on the way back from Canterbury                         C. The winner of the contest will receive a reward","D. All of the options are correct                  54. For which social classes did Chaucer write                         A. Nobles                         B. Churchmen                         C. Merchants                         D. Peasants                         E. All of the options are correct                  55. Which type of character is NOT represented in Chaucer's The Canterbury Tales?                         A. Women                         B. Kings                         C. Laborers                         D. Churchmen                  56. Why is determining the purpose Chaucer had in mind for The Canterbury Tales difficult?                         A. The full range of planned stories was never completed.                         B. The frequent use of satire obscures any clear message.                         C. The manuscript was heavily censored by the Church.                         D. Chaucer was notoriously unreliable as a narrator and as a person.                  57. Chaucer focused his writing around the Criticism of Three Areas of Societies to highlight aspects                 of medieval society that had been corrupted. In the part of his book on social rank, a commoner                 challenges the knight and begins speaking prior to a monk. Why would this have mattered during                 that period of time?                         A. It was socially unacceptable for a common person to speak to either a knight or a monk in                 a public setting.                         B. The statements of a high class person such as the knight should be accepted without                 question in any gathering.                         C. It was socially unacceptable for a common person to approach someone of a higher                 social class let alone challenge one.                         D. The monk had been asked to speak after the knight and the commoner should have                 known to wait his turn to be called upon.                  58. The Canterbury Tales is probably Chaucer's most famous work. It is likely that Chaucer had the                 ability to write about all of the different included characters because:                         A. Chaucer had a very vivid imagination and could estimate how other people lived their lives                 with some certainty.                         B. Chaucer came from a very wealthy family and was well educated in the careers and lives                 of others.                         C. Chaucer did many different jobs, traveled, studied, and had many friends of                 different backgrounds to give him context.                         D. Chaucer did extensive research on each of the different characters in the Canterbury                 Tales by doing each of their jobs for a year.                  59. Why was the fact that Chaucer wrote in the vernacular (Middle English) of the time in which he                 was living considered revolutionary?                         A. Most important works were written in Latin or French, and using the common                 vernacular (Middle English)  made his work more accessible to everyday people.                         B. Chaucer's work was meant to be taught to teenagers in school, so he wanted to make the                 language easy to understand.","C. Before Chaucer's time, everyone wrote in French, which made reading difficult if you did                 not understand French.                         D. Chaucer's work was less formal, making it more reader friendly.                  60. Beowulf is thought to be written by                         A. Geoffrey Chaucer                         B. Homer                         C. William Shakespeare                         D. An unknown author                  61-70.

The two types of frequency distribution table is descriptive FDT and inferential FDT.                                2.   Raw data is also known as array.                                3.   The range is equivalent to the product of the highest value and lowest value.                                4.   The relative frequency is usually expressed in percentage.                                5.   To compute the less than cumulative frequency, one should start from the highest                                     class to the lowest class.                                6.   Histogram is a graphical device for displaying the shapes of distributions.                                7.   Bar graphs are generally better at comparing changes over time.                                8.   Graphical method of presenting data uses paragraph of text.                                9.   A good graph should be clear, simple, elegant, and accurate.                                10.  Line graphs are appropriate only when the x- and y-axes are both displaying variables                                     in the ordinal level.                                11.

TRUE OR FALSE.  Write MATH if the statement is true and WHAT if it is false.                                1.   The range is equivalent to the product of the highest value and lowest value.                                2.   The relative frequency is usually expressed in percentage.                                3.   To compute the less than cumulative frequency, one should start from the highest                                     class to the lowest class.                                4.   60% of the students in the class scored above the median test grade.                                5.   A dataset is possible to have no modes.                                6.   Raw data is also known as array.                                7.   Each equal part divided by the quartiles is equivalent to 25%.                                8.   The class limits are the end numbers for each class.                                9.   The Kelly range is the difference between the highest and lowest scores divided by 2.                                10.  The standard deviation is the square of the variance.                                11.  The shape of the normal curve is bell-shaped.                                12.  The probability that X assumes a value greater than 27 is P(X ≥ 27).                                13.  P(Z > z) = 0.9251                                14.  P(32 < X < 58) is the probability that X assumes a value between 32 and 58.                                15.  The normal distribution is different from the normal curve.

(2 points each)           When Philippine Senate Majority Leader Vicente Sotto III delivered a speech last month about the dangers of artificial          contraceptives, he did not expect he would become embroiled in a heated and acrimonious debate about the sins of          plagiarism, and not about his opposition to the Reproductive Health bill …             … Sotto’s misfortune of being called a plagiarist continued this week when he was accused of plagiarizing Senator           Robert F. Kennedy after it was exposed that the concluding part of one of Sotto’s speech was a direct Filipino translation           of a speech made by Kennedy in 1966. Sotto has denied the accusation again.            This is not the first time that a high-ranking Philippines official was involved in a plagiarism scandal.
