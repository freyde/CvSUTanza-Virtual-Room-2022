               set as well as the assessment that will be done to ensure that the student learning
               outcomes will be met. Discuss your answers. (10 points)

               Situation 1
                       Teacher  Jan  aims  that  her  student  in  Mathematics  will  have  mastery  of  the  four
               fundamental operations.
                Answer:
               Objectives:
               At the end of the lesson, the students will be able to:
                   •  Apply the four fundamental operations in real life situations
                   •  Modify the different techniques in solving the operations
                   •  Solve for the problem by performing the four basic operations.

               Motivation:
                   •  The class is divided into four groups. Each group will assign a participant to each of
                       the equations that the instructor will demonstrate. Additional points will be awarded to
                       the group with the most correct answers.

               Activity:
                   •  Students are given two dice to roll. They multiply, divide, and add the two numbers
                       displayed on the dice (if they can).
                   •  They use a counter to cover all of the answers that appear in the grid. The winning
                       team would be the first person to get four answers in a row (horizontally, vertically, or
                       diagonally).

               Application:
                       With the same group, they will solve for the values of the given situation
                   •  Group 1: Cathy traveled 450 miles to her grandmother’s house in two days. She
                       traveled 50 more miles on Saturday than on Sunday. How many miles did she travel
                       on Saturday and Sunday?
                   •  Group 2: The aquarium has a lot of fish tanks. They bought 18 more fish and now the
                       aquarium has 149 fish. How many fish did the aquarium have to begin with?
                   •  Group 3: In a school there are 26 pupils in every section. About how many pupils are
                       there if there are 56 sections.
                   •  Group 4: A clothing factory can produce 5,216 pairs of shorts in 60 days. If the
                       factory makes the same number of shorts daily, how many pairs of shorts can it
                       produce in a day?

               Evaluation:
               Solve the following:
                   1.  Nate has a science project. He is collected 433 cans on Monday. He collected 203
                       more on Tuesday. How many can did Tim collect in all?
                   2.  Daniel had some noodles. He gave 12 noodles to William. Now Daniel only has 54
                       noodles. How many noodles did Daniel have to begin with?
                   3.  Alyssa had 129 cookies. Aiyanna has 140 cookies and 34 crackers. How many more
                       cookies does Aiyanna have than Alyssa?
                   4.  Mother bought 715 onions. She placed 15 onions for each plastic bag. About how
                       may plastic bags did she use?
                   5.  What is the estimated product of 6,327 and 876?]]></page><page Index="145"><![CDATA[Situation 2
                       Teacher  Jed,  handling  Science  class,  wants  his  students  to  have  mastery  of  their
               lesson about conversion of units of measure before he advances to the next lessons. He
               does  not  simply  aim  for  concepts  but  he  wants  to  have  his  students  acquire  the  skill  in
               converting unit of measures.
               Answer:
               Objectives:
               At the end of the lesson, the students will be able to:
                   •  Build a greater understanding of how units, measures, and conversions are used.
                   •  Develop stronger mathematical skills in multiplying and dividing.
                   •  Solve for the value of the conversion units.

               Motivation:
                       Group Task
                   •  The students are given the task of completing the puzzle by using multiplication and
                       division to solve the problem.
                   •  They will look for and paste each answer they collect on the paper to complete the
                       puzzle.

               Activity:
                       Individual Task
                   •  The  students  will  draw  a  map  of  their  travel  going  to  school.  They  will  estimate
                       measurements of their travel, and explain it in class.

               Application:
                   o  Group 1: Nina is a rower and in one week she rows 14.56 km. However, she needs
                       to find out how many centimeters this is, for science reasons. Can you calculate how
                       many cm she rowed in 1 week?
                   o  Group 2: You are buying carpet to cover a room that measures 38 ft by 40 ft. The
                       carpet cost 700 pesos per square yard. How much will the carpet cost?

               Evaluation:
                   1.  The conversion factors from meter to centimeters are:
                   2.  What is the metric unit for volume?
                   3.  A  sample  contains  430  mg  of  mercury.  How  many  significant  figures  are  in  the

               Situation 1
                       Teacher  Jan  aims  that  her  student  in  Mathematics  will  have  mastery  of  the  four
               fundamental operations.
                Answer:
               Teacher Jan set the objectives about the four fundamental operations.
               Example
               Objectives:
               At the end of the lesson, the students will be able to:
                     Distinguish the rules on different operation.
                     Construct a mathematical equation using the four (4) operations.
                     Recognize the importance of four operations in real life.

               To meet the objectives teacher Jan should give an activity.
               Example
               Identify parts of an expression using mathematical terms (sum, term, product, factor,
               quotient, coefficient); view one or more parts of an expression as a single entity. For
               example, describe the expression 2 (8 + 7) as a product of two factors; view (8 + 7) as both
               a single entity and a sum of two terms.


               Situation 2
                       Teacher  Jed,  handling  Science  class,  wants  his  students  to  have  mastery  of  their
               lesson about conversion of units of measure before he advances to the next lessons. He
               does  not  simply  aim  for  concepts  but  he  wants  to  have  his  students  acquire  the  skill  in
               converting unit of measures.
               Answer:
               Teacher Jed should deliver the lesson to meet the objective the he desire and he should use
               performance based assessment to assess the students. In this assessment help the student
               to demonstrate their skill and understanding. Teacher Jed should give an actual activity
               inside the classroom like measuring distance this activity can be do inside the classroom. In
               this activity the student will be identified the conversion unit and it will help them to retain the
               lesson.

               STEP 1: Defining the purpose of assessment
               General Competency:
                     Define sequence Skill.
                     Identify the next term of a sequence.
                     Value accumulated knowledge as means of new understanding.


               Specific Competencies:
                     Students will sort topic-related events or information in sequential order








               STEP 2: Identifying performance task
                       In this performance task it helps the student to think creatively and they demonstrate
                       the knowledge that they acquire from the lesson. It also helps the student to have a
                       prior  knowledge  about  the  sequence.  In  this  assessment    the  student  will  actively
                       engage in the activity.

               Create  a  scoring  rubric  from  the  task  formulated.  You  can  choose  between  analytic  and
