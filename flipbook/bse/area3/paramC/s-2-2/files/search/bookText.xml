            31. Elizabeth, the second of the five siblings, possesses a sharp mind and independent nature, and she
            feels embarrassed at her mother’s attempts to marry her off. Elizabeth meets Mr. Darcy, who is a wealthy
            landowner. She dislikes him in their first meeting, due to his arrogant attitude because while he admits to
            loving her, he also says many insulting things about her family and social position.

            32. I stared down at the corpse, whose face was covered by a ski mask. Next to the body was a pile of
            money. The biggest pile of money I had ever seen. Attached to the body was a note. I tore it from the
            dead man’s jacket, and read it slowly, over and over, trying to take in its words: Get rid of this and the
            money is yours—I will deliver the other half after the job is done. Sincerely, F.  What I did next was
            something I would grow to regret for the rest of my life.

            33. Susie sat at her table with all of her favorite dolls and stuffed animals. It was afternoon tea time, and
            she started serving each of her pretend friends as she did every other day. But today was no ordinary
            day. As Susie reached the chair where she had sat her favorite stuffed bear, she suddenly had the
            strange feeling like someone was watching her. She stopped pouring the tea and looked up at Bear, who
            stared back with his glass eyes and replied, “Well Hello!!”

            34. As the young girl opened her window, she could see the moons Europa and Calypso rising in the
            distance. A comet flashed by, followed by a trail of stardust, illuminating the dark, endless space that
            surrounded the spacecraft; the only place she had ever known as home. As she gazed at Jupiter, she
            dreamed of a life where she wasn’t stuck orbiting a planet, but living on one. She envisioned stepping
            onto land, real land, like in the stories of Earth her father had told her about. She tried to imagine the
            taste of fresh air, the feel of a cool, salty ocean, and the sound of wind rustling through a tree’s green
            leaves. But these were only fantasies, not memories. She had been born on the ship, and if they didn’t
            find a new inhabitable planet soon, she would surely die there too.

            35. The woman crept down the hall in the dark, holding baseball bat above her head, her arms shaking,
            lungs begging for air as she tried not to breath. She knew it was here, the one who stalked her, terrorized
            her, tried to kill her—she didn’t care what everyone said. She knew it was all of it was real, and now she
            was going to catch it and prove to everyone that she wasn’t insane. She was almost at the doorway. 5
            more steps. 4 more steps. 3. 2. 1…BANG! She threw open door, and swung the bat with all of the force

            36. There came a light tap at the library door—and, pale as the tenant of a tomb, a menial entered upon
            tiptoe. His looks were wild with terror, and he spoke to me in a voice tremulous, husky, and very low.
            What said he?—some broken sentences I heard. He told of a wild cry disturbing the silence of the night—
            of the gathering together of the household—of a search in the direction of the sound; and then his tones
            grew thrillingly distinct as he whispered me of a violated grave—of a disfigured body enshrouded, yet still
            breathing—still palpitating—still alive!

            40. An ugly, warty frog sat on his lily pad enjoying the sunshine. Another frog hopped along and said,
            “wow, you are hideous! There is no way you will ever find a mate!” Just then, a beautiful princess came to
            the pond, scooped up the ugly frog, and planted a big kiss on his warty nose. He instantly turned into a
            tall, handsome prince, and walked off hand in hand with the princess as the other frog watched with his
            mouth wide in astonishment. Never judge a book by its cover.

        GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS:
               This academic requirement shall compose of:

                    A. Video of Demonstration Teaching
                    B. Individual Course Reflection/Narrative
                       I. Introduction: Pre-Service Teacher’s Profile
                       II. ICT Open-Ended Tools: Preparations and Description of Technologies used
                       III. Reflection: Final Demonstration and Course takeaways

               A. PAIR WORK: Recorded Final Demonstration
               GUIDELINES:
                   1.  Review previous modules and prepare your Final Learning Plan, together with your
                       Instructional materials and other ICT Open-Ended Tools to be used during the
                       demonstration.
                   2.  Pre-Service Teachers are to prepare for the demonstration and secure a recording
                       of it.
                   3.  Set expectations and plan in advance for your virtual demonstration.
                       Reconsider lesson procedures and other things that may take place while recording.
                   4.  Be considerate about the background, lighting, and audio quality. Prevent
                       unnecessary stuff that may cause distraction and/or disruption of your preps.
                   5.  Dress as you would if you were doing an actual demonstration as a Pre-Service
                       Teacher.
                   6.  Be confident with yourself —especially your preparations. Practice and work on your
                       camera presence to be more comfortable in presenting this way. Learn and enjoy
                       the recording process.
                   7.  Keep the authenticity of the demonstration and AVOID major touch-ups with the
                       recording.
                   8.  Highlight the use of your ICT Open-Ended tools in the course of the lesson proper.
                   9.  Review your final output before uploading. Self and peer-assessment is essential.
                   10. You may upload your recording through a third-party application and/or directly link it
                       on our Google Classroom.
