                              I am Khaila M. Diaz. I was born on July 21, 2000, in Trece Martires City. I am

                       the youngest among five children of Mr. Francisco P. Diaz and Mrs. Amalia M. Diaz. I

                       am currently residing at Belleview Meadows, Brgy, Bagtas, Tanza, Cavite.

                              I obtained my primary education at Bagtas Elementary School in Brgy. Bagtas,

                       Tanza, Cavite in 2012. I finished my secondary education at Tanza National Trade

                       School in Paradahan, Tanza, Cavite in 2018.


                              In June 2018, I took up the program Bachelor of Secondary Education major in

                       English at Cavite State University – Tanza Campus. I was elected as the Community

                       Dear Readers,

                              This  portfolio  summarizes  my  entire  practice  teaching  experience  at  New

                       Generation  International  School  (NGIS).  In  this  portfolio,  I  give  an  overview  of  my

                       student teaching experience, which demonstrates my understanding of teaching and

                       a  collection  of  resources  that  will  assist  me  in  defining  my  teaching  beliefs  and

                       approaches.  This  serves  as  a  record  of  my  knowledge,  such  as  how  to  deal  with


                       various situations I met during field practice. It also demonstrates my strengths as a

                       teacher while also recognizing my areas for development.

                              As  a  future  educator  of  English,  I  will  teach  my  students  the  essential

                       competencies  required and  develop  their abilities  in reading,  writing,  listening,  and

                       speaking.  Not  only  English-related  but  also  in  real-life  situations.  I  worked  hard  to


                       ensure that my students had the foundational abilities they needed to think creatively

                       and critically as they progressed to another year. I also included necessary teaching

                       evidence like daily lesson plans and instructional materials. I reflected on the classes

                       I  have  taught,  including  class  activities,  assessments,  and  feedback  from  my  co-

                       teachers and students.

                              In  this  compilation,  my  perspective  and  aims  for  becoming  a  globally

                       competitive teacher will be defined as their result. Furthermore, the various entries in


                       this portfolio demonstrate how far I am willing to go to accomplish my responsibilities,

                       particularly during my field practice.

                       and valuable suggestions throughout the entire practice teaching. I am fortunate to

                       have a supporting teacher like you who is patient and approachable.


                              To Mrs. Mildred A. Sebastian and Ms. Estelita A. Villa, our coordinator, for their

                       like you, even though it was difficult sometimes. Thank you, my dearest class of 2021

                       for your cooperation and appreciation during my internship.

                              To  my  supportive  family,  especially  my  parents,  Ms.  Amalia  Diaz  and  Mr.

                       Francisco Diaz, who serve as my inspiration for their educational love and support in

                       my studies.

                              To my co-teachers, Ms. Noren Alivia and Ms. Kasselle Shane Branzuela, for

                       helping  me  conquer  my  struggles  in  life  and  helping  me  throughout  our  teaching

                              To all their instructors, who shared and continuously shared their knowledge

                       with the students and kept on molding them to become better persons;

                              And mostly to our Almighty God, for whom everything provides the source of

                                EXPECTATIONS OF THE STUDENT TEACHING PROGRAM




                          Teaching  is  a  noble  job  since  it  is  the  only  profession  that  teaches  another

                   profession. Of course, if there is a need for teaching, we will need a place to do so; that is

                   why schools were established to provide a space where everyone is welcome, and anyone

                   can be who they aspire to be, free to dream and learn. The school is not only a facility

                   where students can grow their gardens of knowledge, but it is also a place where they can

                   dream big and work hard to attain their goals.


                          My first thought of what would happen to me at this institution was that I would be

                   subjected to various emotions and feelings. I was thrilled at the idea of finally getting to

                   work in education, and of course, student teaching for me would mean that I am a step

                   closer to my graduation.

                          On the other hand, it was overwhelming for me to face a new environment, new


                   faces, and new experiences. I was also troubled with all the pessimistic questions in my

                   head. "Do I belong here? What if the students do not like my presence at all? What if my

                   cooperating  teacher  dislikes  me  completely?  Will  the  school's  faculty  and  staff  be

                   supportive? What if I do not become the kind of teacher I hoped to be?" With all of these

                   questions, I began to feel afraid and anxious about what was about to happen.  I was

                   concerned that I would have difficulty getting along with my cooperating teachers. I was

                   frightened to speak in front of my students.


                          However, as a future educator, I must be able to adapt and accept changes in the

                   environment. I commit to doing what is necessary for my future profession. I must be the

                   type of teacher who always understands, observes, and embraces the people and their

                   surroundings. I should not ask any more "what if" questions regarding the school to which

                   I was assigned since, regardless of what we do, we will be assigned anywhere, to new


                   areas, not just to teach but also to make a difference.]]></page><page Index="36"><![CDATA[2


                                      REFLECTION ON CLASSROOM OBSERVATION




                          Without  a  doubt,  a  classroom  observation  is  an  essential  part  of  teaching.  It

                   ensures  that  teachers  provide  a  satisfactory  learning  experience  for  the  student  and

                   identifies  weaknesses  that  can  be  improved  with  proper  adjustments  and  training.

                   However, they can be stress-inducing not just for the teacher being observed but also for

                   the  observer,  as  they  try  to  ensure  objectivity  in  their  observations  and  deal  with  the

                   problems involved.


                          During my two weeks classroom observation phase, I have learned different things

                   about my cooperating teacher (CT) and the students. If I describe Ms. Vicedo, my CT, I

                   could say that she is an outgoing person. She tends to lighten the mood in the class and

                   make the lesson enjoyable. She uses examples that are relatable to the students. Overall,

                   she has the trait of a great teacher.


                          Everything was going well until the second week of our observation. The Grade 8

                   students were uncooperative in class. You could not hear a word from them, even a “yes”

                   when Ms. Vicedo tried to ask them a question. This made her a bit out of character. She

                   scolded the students and told them about what would happen to their grades if they kept

                   being inactive in class. This situation went on for weeks which made me anxious and

                   concerned about what would happen during my internship. What if they are uncooperative

                   in my class too? What will happen in my final demo teaching if they still behave like this?


                   Just the thought of it made me nervous and stressed. Because of this, I tried my best to

                   be attentive in class and familiarize myself with the student’s behavior to come up with a

                   different approach when that time came.

                          Sure enough, I was able to find a solution to this problem. I made a spinning wheel

                   where it contains the names of the students. This will serve as their recitation, so they will


                   be forced to participate in class, but I also made sure not to pressure them. I also added

                   a rule in this wheel: they can call one of their classmates to help them if they do not know

                   the answer. This method was proven effective as I noticed that they started participating]]></page><page Index="37"><![CDATA[3


                   in class. I only used this method when no one was motivated to answer. Fortunately, some

                   of the students were participating of their own accord.

                          As a pre-service teacher, observing a professional teacher in the actual field as

                   they discuss was a different feeling, and it gave me a different perspective. It made me


                   competitive and discerning as a pre-service teacher. It also molded my teaching style and

                   approach in class.

                          During  my  class  observation,  I  was  also  able  to  assess  my  strengths  and

                   weaknesses. As a future educator, I believe my biggest challenge will be becoming flexible

                   with my schedule (changing lesson plans around, etc.) and motivating each student to


                   learn  and  be  active  in  the  class.  I  will  address  these  challenges  by  becoming  more

                   organized and doing projects where participation is graded and required so then that each

                   student will be learning and not be left out.

                          On  the  other  hand,  my  strengths  include  being  very  determined,  goal-driven,

                   hardworking, and trying to help motivate others. I will use these strengths to the best of

                   my ability when I have my class in the future. I want to continue my teaching-learning

                   process, obtain my teaching certification soon, and get my degree.


                          After observing this past semester, I would like to work with junior high school

                   students  because  I  think  I  would  respond  better  to  them.  These  observations  were

                   fascinating and helped me better appreciate the teaching profession. They also helped me

                   decide what grade level I would like to teach.]]></page><page Index="38"><![CDATA[4


                            SELF-ASSESSMENT ON READINESS IN THE ACTUAL TEACHING




                          What does it mean to be ready? According to the dictionary, readiness means "the

                   state of being fully prepared for something." I maybe not be fully prepared as a pre-service

                   teacher, but I could say that I am ready to take on the challenges ahead and make the

                   most of the opportunities for learning in front of me. Prepared to try, fail, and try again.

                          I have been a student teacher for three months before in a private school during

                   my summer vacation, right after graduating from senior high school. I was recommended


                   by my adviser to teach at her school. It was a relatively small elementary school. There

                   were only 30 students overall. However, it was a great experience. I was able to practice

                   writing lesson plans, which I was already familiar with it when I started attending college.

                   The classes that I handled were Grade 5 and 6. They are all fun to be with. After the end

                   of my student teaching, they gave me personal letters. Most of them wrote that I am a


                   great speaker and a strict teacher. Receiving these letters was very heartwarming. I was

                   filled with different emotions at that time. It helped me reflect on my own decision as well.

                   I thought that maybe these letters were enough reasons for choosing the teaching career

                   path among other options I had. To be honest, I never intended to become a teacher. I

                   only picked this program because I thought teaching materials would be easily accessible,

                   considering my sister is also a teacher. However, that was not the case. I never had any

                   help from my sister regarding my chosen program. But I learned to love teaching over time.


                   I have gained interest in it and thought, "teaching is not that bad after all."

                          Applying your training and knowledge in a real-world classroom is an integral part

                   of becoming a teacher. Leaping theory to practice can be an entirely new experience, but

                   it provides a valuable opportunity to gain confidence in my teaching ability. I have been

                   through the hands of many teachers along the way. I have received a lot of praise and


                   criticism about how I managed to deliver whatever topic I ought to discuss with people.]]></page><page Index="39"><![CDATA[5


                                                     DAILY JOURNAL




                   Day 1:  7 October 2021

                          Today was the official start of our practice teaching journey at New Generation

                   International School (NGIS). After weeks of waiting for approval, we finally made it here.

                   Our cooperating teacher (CT), Ms. Lovely Vicedo, oriented us before the meeting that we

                   were going to introduce ourselves in class. I was a bit stressed at that time, not because I

                   had to introduce myself in front of the students, but because our house was still under


                   construction;  hence, the  background  noises  could  not  be  avoided. I  also  had  difficulty

                   finding a place where the background looks presentable on the screen. Fortunately, I could

                   find a way to make myself look presentable somehow.

                          When our CT invited us to the virtual meeting, the class had already started. I and

                   my co-teachers, Ms. Alivia and Ms. Branzuela were told to observe the class as advised


                   in our practice teaching orientation. The first class that we attended in the morning was

                   Grade 7. The discussion was about subject-verb agreement. I was thrilled to see how

                   active  the  students  were.  Ms.  Lovely  was  a  great  teacher,  and  you  can  see  that  the

                   students are comfortable with her. In the afternoon, we observed the Grade 8 class – the

                   class that I will handle soon. However, it was evident that they were not active, unlike the

                   Grade 7 students. When I realized this, the first thing that came to my mind was, “what if

                   they are not cooperative during my final demo?” Just the thought of it makes me nervous


                   and stressed. Because of this, I tried my best to be attentive in the class and familiarize

                   myself with the student’s behavior, so I could come up with a different approach when that

                   time came.

                          As a pre-service teacher, observing a professional teacher in the actual field as

                   they discuss is a different feeling, and it gives me a different perspective. I am looking


                   forward to gaining more important lessons from my observation in our next meeting.]]></page><page Index="40"><![CDATA[6

                   Day 2: 8 October 2021

                          Today,  we  were  scheduled  to  observe  the  Grade  7  class.  The  lesson  was  a

                   continuation of the topic last meeting. There were a few technical problems with the slide


                   presentation, but it was fixed immediately. This made me think about what may happen

                   during my class or final demonstration teaching, so I made sure to observe how Ms. Lovely

                   handled the situation. It also makes me a bit worried since I am not familiar with Google

                   Meet and other platforms, so I guess I have to work on that.

                   Day 3: 12 October 2021

                          We  observed  the  Grade  7  class  today,  and  as  usual,  they  were  active  and

                   cooperative  in  class.  Unfortunately,  I  am  not  feeling  well  today,  so  I  had  to  leave  the

                   meeting early. Ms. Video told me that it was okay since I was not handling the Grade 7


                   class,  and  I  was  only  there  to  observe  them.  I  am  glad  that  I  was  assigned  to  an

                   understanding teacher like her.



                   Day 4: 13 October 2021

                          Today, we were scheduled to attend in Grade 8 class. They were still passive, just


                   like the first time we observed them. They did not recite much in class unless Ms. Lovely

                   called their names. She also expressed her disappointment in them but not to the point

                   that it would create tension in class. It was a mild reminder for them to be cooperative in

                   class, and honestly, I understand how she feels in this situation. It is tough to get into

                   teaching when no one is responding to you - like as if you are talking to a wall. I hope I can

                   overcome this problem in the future.

                   Day 5: 15 October 2021

                          Today,  we  were  scheduled  to  observe  in  Grade  7  class.  The  topic  was  the

                   continuation  of  last  week’s  discussion.  You  can  see  that  the  students  understand  the

                   subject because they know what to answer every time Ms. Lovely asks them. Seeing an


                   active class like this excites me to teach students. I hope the Grade 8 students are as

                   vibrant as the Grade 7 students. I cannot help but compare them since there is a big

                   noticeable difference in their presence in the class.

                   Day 6: 18 October 2021


                          Today, we were scheduled to observe in Grade 8 class. The meeting was just a

                   preview of their upcoming periodical exam. They reviewed their previous lessons and had

                   a question-and-answer session so the students could clarify some things that they were

                   having a hard time understanding. We also visited the school to get reference books since

                   we will start teaching next week after the students’ academic break. Finally, we met our

                   cooperating teacher, Ms. Lovely, in person. She was friendly and approachable. We talked

                   about how the class will proceed and the parts of the lesson that we needed to teach. I


                   was assigned to teach grammar. Although she also mentioned that the class discussion]]></page><page Index="43"><![CDATA[9


                   would be alternate, so I might also teach literature. It was just a brief meeting, and we left

                   the school after getting our copies of the books.

                   Day 7: 19 October 2021

                          Like yesterday in Grade 8 class, Ms. Lovely reviewed the Grade 7 class to prepare

                   them for their upcoming periodical exam. Everyone was active and participative during the

                   review. Ms. Lovely did not have to call for their names since they answered of their own

                   accord. Observing how the students behave in the class, I could say that they understand

                   each topic and are ready for their upcoming exams.

                   Day 8: 20 October 2021

                          There was no scheduled class today since it was their periodical exam. I hope the

                   Grade 8 students will get good grades despite being passive in class. Moreover, I used

                   the time to get familiarized with the book's content. Our cooperating teacher also provided


                   us with some PowerPoint presentations templates as our guide. Moreover, I am so glad

                   that Ms. Lovely is our cooperating teacher. She responds immediately to our queries and

                   is easy to talk to. I heard my other classmates have a strict CT, so I feel fortunate to have

                   Ms. Lovely.




                   Day 9: 25 October 2021

                          The students were still in their academic break, so I used this time to prepare my

                   lesson plan for Grade 8. It was pretty easy since I had all the materials my cooperating

                   teacher gave. I only have to think about the examples and activities to implement in the

                   class.

                   Day 10: 26 October 2021

                          Today, I finished working on my lesson plan so I could proceed with working on the

                   PowerPoint Presentation. Everything went smooth since I was in the mood to work today.

                   I woke up with an overwhelming sense of productivity. I started my day by cleaning my


                   workstation. I made sure that my space was free from distraction, and by distraction, I

                   meant my phone. I cannot seem to be productive every time I see my phone on the table.

                   I always find myself scrolling on my social media account for hours. Because of this, I

                   decided to put it inside my drawer where I could not see it. And it did not fail me. I was able

                   to finish my lesson plan. Not to be dramatic, but it feels like I am getting my life together


                   whenever I take a break from social media.



                   Day 11: 3 November 2021

                          Today, we were scheduled to observe the Grade 8 class. Ms. Lovely showed her

                   frustration  with  the  students  because  they  were  not  submitting  their  activities  and

                   assignments. It was the first time I saw her get seriously mad, and you could see her face

                   frowning. After reminding them, she started the discussion. You can see the tension in the


                   class,  unlike  before.  The  students  were  silent  the  whole  time  unless  she  called  their

                   names. Some were responding on their own accord, which was a good thing; otherwise,

                   the discussion would not move forward.

                   Day 12: 5 November 2021

                          Today  was  the  start  of  my  co-teacher,  Ms.  Noren’s  teaching  experience.  She

                   taught the Grade 7 class that she was handling. The discussion went great, and I learned

                   a  lot  of  things  from  her.  I  gained  some  new  techniques  and  approaches  that  I  could


                   incorporate  into my  class  in  the future. The  students  were  active  too, just  like  before,

                   especially when discussing English topics such as Elements of Poetry. But they were a bit

                   silent when it came to literature, but I think it was okay, considering that literature requires

                   analyzing and interpreting, so it may take some time. Overall, Ms. Noren did great, and

                   she was also familiar with Google Meet, so that I might ask for her help.

                   Day 13: 7 November 2021

                          We do not have a scheduled meeting for today, so I decided to make a visual


                   material that I could use in class. It was a wheel that contained all of my students' names,

                   and whoever got picked by the wheel will answer my question. I came up with this idea to

                   overcome desperate situations – if they are not participating in class. It will be the biggest

                   problem in my final demonstration, so I will try to practice this method to let them participate

                   in class.]]></page><page Index="47"><![CDATA[13

                   Day 14: 8 November 2021

                          Today, we were scheduled to observe in Grade 8 class. This was the end of our


                   observation class, so I tried to be extra attentive. Ms. Lovely started the class by reviewing

                   their previous discussion, and then they proceeded to the activity. She just asked them to

                   answer  the  questions  in  the  book.  She  also  told  them  to  write  the  questions  in  their

                   notebook to review the sentences as they wrote. Since the meeting ended shortly, I used

                   the remaining time to study the lesson that I will teach next week.

                   Day 15: 9 November 2021

                          On this day, I attended the Grade 7 class led by Ms. Noren. As advised by our

                   cooperating  teacher,  she  started  the  discussion  with  a  review  before  giving  them  an

                   activity. She also introduced us to the educational site called Padlet. It is a site where you


                   can create single or multiple walls that house all the posts you want to share. It is a blank

                   slate from videos and images to documents and audio. It is collaborative, too, allowing you

                   to involve students, other teachers, and even parents and guardians. It has a user-friendly

                   interface perfect for the students since it does not have any complicated instructions. I am

                   glad that my co-teacher introduced this site to us so I could use it in my class tomorrow.

                   Day 16: 10 November 2021

                          After weeks of observation, my actual teaching experience finally came. I never felt

                   any  nervousness  in  me;  all  I  felt  was  excitement.  The  topic  was  transition  words  and

                   expository paragraphs, which are easy to teach, so there was nothing to be nervous about.

                   Two hours before our virtual meeting, I prepared myself to look more presentable in front

                   of the students. I also performed a dry run to see if the transition of the lesson was delicate.


                   “I am ready! You can do this!” I said to myself.]]></page><page Index="49"><![CDATA[15


                              There was a technical and internet connection problem on Ms. Lovely’s end when

                   the meeting started, so she told me that she would follow up and start the class without

                   her. I did what she told me and started the class by introducing myself again. Even though

                   I already introduced myself before during our first meeting, I feel like they have already


                   forgotten my name, considering it has been a few weeks since I showed myself to them. I

                   told them all the classroom rules that I had in mind and encouraged them to ask questions

                   in class for clarification. As expected, the Grade 8 students were passive in class when I

                   asked them some questions, so I brought out the wheel I made the other day. Fortunately,

                   I could see that they were trying. Some students were also participating. However, there


                   was a time when the class kept getting interrupted because Ms. Lovely was having a hard

                   time entering the meeting. I am glad that my co-teachers were there to assist me. They

                   also helped me with the layout in Google Meet because I am not familiar with the setting.

                              Overall, the meeting ended well, and I could say that I did great. My co-teachers

                   also told me that the Grade 8 class was more active, unlike the other meetings during our

                   observation phase. I hope I can see more of the students’ enthusiasm in class in our next

                   meeting.

                   Day 17: 11 November 2021

                          We do not have a class today, so I decided to review the topic yesterday to prepare

                   for our next Wednesday meeting. Thinking about how I delivered the lesson yesterday, I

                   think I did great, but honestly, I could do better than that. I was nervous during the class,


                   and I sweated excessively, probably because of my room condition. I was also getting out

                   of breath as I spoke because I tend to talk fast. I will try to do better in our next meetings

                   and work on these shortcomings.



                   Day 18: 12 November 2021


                          Today was Ms. Branzuela’s first teaching experience. I was late when I entered the

                   meeting because I overslept, but I am glad that I could still see her discussion. The class

                   was  participative  in  class,  and  it  seemed that they  were  having  a great time  with  Ms.

                   Branzuela’s teaching. The class discussion ended well, and I gained new approaches and

                   techniques that I could incorporate into my class. She was not strict in class, and she

                   guided the students in the correct answer.

                   Day 19: 15 November 2021

                          Today, I gave the Grade 8 students a written activity; but before that, I reviewed

                   them first about the lesson discussed in the last meeting. I asked them questions related

                   to transition words, general-to-specific patterns, and expository paragraphs to see if they


                   understood the topic. After that, I presented them with the activity they would do for the

                   day. The task was about writing an expository paragraph that contains the use of transition

                   words. They will write their paragraphs on Padlet, which is the educational site that my co-

                   teacher  told  us  about  last  week.  Fortunately,  the  students  quickly  understood  how  to

                   navigate the site. I made their review a short discussion so they could have more time to


                   do their activity. Some students were still unable to pass their paragraphs during class

                   hours, so I extended the submission time until 6 P.M. I believe, as a teacher, I should give

                   the students the right amount of consideration and stick to my ground.

                   Day 20: 16 November 2021

                          Today, we observed the Grade 7 class led by Ms. Branzuela. As usual, it was an

                   interactive class. She also used Quizziz for their activity and the Picker Wheel, where


                   whoever gets picked by the wheel will earn additional points for the said activity. It is a]]></page><page Index="52"><![CDATA[18


                   great technique to make the students active and enthusiastic about the task so that I might

                   incorporate it in the future.

                          After the meeting, I check my students’ activity on Padlet. Their works were all

                   great, and I could see that most of them understood our topic. However, two of them wrote


                   an opinionated paragraph, so it is no longer an example of expository writing. I will try to

                   address this in our next meeting to give them some clarification about the topic. I also

                   checked the assignments that I gave them last week with individual comments so they

                   could use them in their written works in the future. Although I admit that giving each of

                   them personal feedback was quite tiresome, I still did it for their improvement in academic


                   writing. It may also boost their confidence and participation in our English class.

                   Day 21: 17 November 2021

                          Today we observed the Grade 8 class that Ms. Lovely herself led. She discussed

                   Japanese folktale, particularly “The Happy Mirror,” and the literal and figurative language.

                   She also addressed the figure of speech; although it is not included in the book, I think it

                   is an excellent way to review the students’ knowledge about the said topic. I also noticed


                   that Ms. Lovely seemed to be in a good mood today and did not point out the students’

                   attitude in class, which is good to lessen the tension between them.]]></page><page Index="53"><![CDATA[19

                          We have no scheduled class today, so I decided to start working on my lesson plan


                   for our next meeting. The topic is about using claim and counterclaim signal words, which

                   I think is an easy lesson to teach since I already introduced them to the signal words last

                   discussion. There are also lots of references on the internet that I can use.

                   Day 23: 19 November 2021

                          Today, Ms. Lovely had an errand to do, so she could not attend the Grade 7 class.

                   I  used  the  time  to  continue  working  on my  lesson  plan  and  preparing my  PowerPoint

                   presentation.  I  wanted  to  try  using  educational  technology  tools  such  as  Jamboard,


                   YouTube clips, Quizizz, and Google Form. I explored the tools of those sites so that I could

                   see  if  I  could really  use  them  with  convenience.  But then,  I  realized  that  some  of  the

                   students  are  not  able  to  use some  of  it  because  it's  new  to  them. I might  waste time

                   explaining how to use those sites, so I stuck with what they already know, which is Quizziz.

                   Moreover, I am also feeling under the weather today, so I just rested for the whole day


                   after working. As teachers, we should prioritize our health and know when to rest.



                   Day 24: 22 November 2021

                          Today, we were scheduled to observe the Grade 8 class. Ms. Lovely reviewed the

                   students about the previous lessons - starting from the types of irony up to the topic that I

                   have discussed because they will have a summative test next meeting. The class was

                   somehow participative during the discussion since it was for their own sake. I am glad that


                   they were answering whenever they were asked. I hope they will get high scores on the

                   test so I can evaluate if they understand my discussion.

                   Day 25: 23 November 2021

                          Today, we attended the Grade 7 class. Just like yesterday, Ms. Lovely reviewed

                   the students about their previous lessons for their summative test next meeting. They were

                   very active in class, and you can see that they understood the discussion. Ms. Lovely was


                   also having a great time teaching them. She even expressed that she enjoys the company

                   of their class. I guess she cannot help but compare the enthusiasm between the Grade 7

                   and Grade 8 students.

                          There was no class for today since the Grade 8 class had their summative test. I

                   genuinely hope that they will do well on their test. Moreover, I also used my free time today

                   to work on my teaching portfolio and review my previous entries in my journal to evaluate


                   my  observations  for  the  past  few  weeks.  After  that,  I  worked  on  my  PowerPoint

                   Presentation and added some details.]]></page><page Index="56"><![CDATA[22

                   Day 27: 26 November 2021

                          Today was the summative test for Grade 7 students, so there was no scheduled

                   meeting today.  I  used this  time to  work  on my  portfolio  and  read my  previous  journal


                   entries, just like what I did yesterday.



                   Day 28: 29 November 2021

                          Today was my vaccination schedule and also my class discussion on Grade 8. I

                   was scared that I might not be able to attend the class on time since many people were


                   waiting in line. But fortunately, the process was fast, so I went home immediately and

                   prepared myself for the discussion.

                              Before I proceeded to the proper lesson, I asked them how their summative test

                   went, and I was glad because Ms. Lovely said they got good grades. This means that they

                   genuinely understood our lesson, and my discussion was clear to them. I was afraid that

                   they might not appreciate our discussion since they are passive in class, but I am glad it

                   was  the  opposite.  I  congratulated  them  after  hearing  the  news  and  then  I  started  the


                   lesson. The topic was easy; it was about Claims and Counterclaims. I asked them if they

                   had argued before with someone else on the internet. There was dead air, so I planned to

                   call  for  someone  else.  But  when  I  was  about  to,  a  student  answered  and  shared  her]]></page><page Index="57"><![CDATA[23


                   experience in class. I am glad that some students participated in class when no one else

                   responded. Overall, the discussion went great. I ended the meeting as fast as I could to

                   rest after getting vaccinated.

                   Day 29: 30 November 2021


                          There was no scheduled class today since it is a holiday. I used this time to create

                   a  PowerPoint  Presentation  for  the  activity  tomorrow.  Even  though  I  felt  so  under  the

                   weather, I forced myself to work so I could present something tomorrow. This is one of the

                   struggles of being a teacher. You cannot rest well knowing that you still have tasks to do.

                   You cannot sleep peacefully at night knowing that you still haven’t finished checking your

                   students’ work. Fortunately, I could finish it, so I took a long rest after that.



                   Day 30: 1 December 2021

                          Today,  I gave  the Grade  8  students  an  activity  about  our  previous  lesson:  the


                   Claims and Counterclaims. Unfortunately, four students were absent today as they went

                   to get vaccinated. I first reviewed the previous discussion to see if they understood it and

                   for those who were absent last meeting. It was just a short review since the topic was]]></page><page Index="58"><![CDATA[24


                   relatively easy to discuss. After that, I present them with the activity where they have to

                   write a counterclaim based on the given claim. The task was equal to 15 points. I gave

                   them the remaining time, but it seemed that the time was still not enough, so I extended

                   the submission time until 5 P.M. I also considered those who were getting vaccinated. In


                   our class group chat, I told them to rest well and that they could submit their activities until

                   Friday.

                              As a teacher and a student simultaneously, it is essential to consider your students'

                   situation and concerns. You have to understand that you are not the only teacher giving

                   them activities. It is also important to remind your students to take a break.

                   Day 31: 3 December 2021

                          Today, we observed the Grade 7 class, which Ms. Lovely led. It has been a while

                   since she last taught this class, so she was enthusiastic about teaching. The topic was

                   personification.  Although  it  was  already  discussed  before,  some  students  still  find  it

                   confusing, so Ms. Lovely provided them with more examples.]]></page><page Index="59"><![CDATA[25

                          There was no class today, but my co-teachers and I discussed in our group chat

                   about PowerPoint templates to use. I shared some of the sites that I usually visit and where


                   I downloaded my templates. We also shared some of our experiences and personal rants

                   about the class we handled. I think it is good to get things out of your chest. I told them

                   that I overthink a lot about my final demonstration teaching since I am still having a hard

                   time with the student’s lack of motivation in class. They told me not to worry about it and

                   gave me words of encouragement. I am delighted that we were placed with the same

                   cooperating teacher because we could talk and share our predicaments.

                   Day 33: 6 December 2021

                          Ms.  Lovely forgot  that  it  was  her turn to teach the Grade  8  class  and was  not

                   prepared.  In  the  end,  she  decided  not  to  meet  the  students  today.  I  understand  her

                   situation since she has three classes to handle and got mixed up. I used my free time to


                   check the students’ work last meeting.

                          Ms. Alivia led the class today in Grade 7. She started the class with video analysis.

                   They were active in class and answered all her questions. The topic was clauses. I could

                   tell  that  she  did  better  today  compared  to  her first  class.  It  is good to see  my friends

                   improving every day in our practice teaching journey.

                          Today is a non-working holiday, but I decided to check the students’ activities.

                   While grading their works, I realized that some of them were still confused about our last

                   discussion about Claims and Counterclaims, so I will try to review it in our next meeting.


                   Well, for the record, I find the activity in the book a bit confusing as well. No wonder they

                   only got average scores. After checking their works, I submitted their grades and reviewed

                   their paper via Messenger. Below are some of the students’ papers I have checked.

                   Day 36: 9 December 2021

                          Today, we observed the Grade 8 class, which Ms. Lovely led. She discussed the


                   Korean  folktale  titled  “The  Tiger’s  Whiskers”  and  Hyperbole.  The  students  were  more

                   active and participative in class today. Maybe because the topic was easy and they were

                   already familiar with the figures of speech.

                              Ms.  Lovely  also  told  us  to  provide  ten  multiple-choice  items  for  the  upcoming

                   quarterly exam in English so the students will be more familiar with the questions. After

                   reviewing  my  previous  lessons,  I  made  sure  that  the  students  were  familiar  with  the

                   questions I gave.]]></page><page Index="62"><![CDATA[28

                          Today, I  observed the Grade  7  class,  which  Ms.  Branzuela  led. It  was  a short

                   meeting since she had just reviewed the students for their upcoming quarterly exam. The

                   class was very active, and everyone was eager to answer. It was good to see that they

                   were having fun during the discussion.

                   Day 38: 13 December 2021

                          We  observed  the  Grade  8  class  today,  led  by  Ms.  Lovely.  She  reviewed  the

                   students for their upcoming quarterly exam on Wednesday. Three students were absent

                   today, so they were more quiet than usual to the point that she was visibly upset in class


                   and  told them that  she would  end  the  class  if they  did  not  participate  in  the  review.  I

                   understand how she felt. I really do. How can you remain cheerful when the students are

                   not  even  trying  despite  your  effort?  After  lashing  out,  some  students  tried  to  answer

                   independently, but Ms. Lovely seemed upset until the end of the meeting. Now, I have lots

                   of what-ifs in my head. What if the students are not cooperative during my final demo?


                   What if there are many absents? To be honest, I am not nervous about delivering the

                   lesson in front of the panelists. I am more scared about how the students will behave

                   during my final demo. I hope that they will try a bit more in class.

                   and Ms. Branzuela taught. As expected, the students were very active, and you could see]]></page><page Index="64"><![CDATA[30


                   that they were having fun while they were answering the questions. I am sure that they will

                   get  good  results  in  their  quarterly  exam  seeing  how  they  participate  and  involve

                   themselves in the class.



                   Day 40: 15 December 2021

                          Today was the start of the students’ 2nd quarterly exam, which will end on Friday.

                   I hope my students get good grades on their English tests. I hope they understand the


                   lessons I taught them and Ms. Lovely’s. I tried my best despite them being passive in class.

                   I know that they are bright students. To cheer and motivate them, I sent a short message

                   and quotation in their group chat.

                              Today,  I  decided  to  prepare  for  my  final  demonstration  teaching  since  I  was

                   scheduled on January 10. Some of my classmates had already started theirs, which made

                   me panic since I hadn’t started anything yet.]]></page><page Index="65"><![CDATA[31


                              I started with creating a lesson plan so it would be easier to create a PowerPoint

                   Presentation later. I used my previous lesson plan as my guide, which was an A4 format.

                   I decided to use the topic that we left off in our last meeting instead of choosing a different

                   topic. The lesson is about Problem-Solution Pattern, which I think is relatively easy since


                   the  students  already  know  signal  words  and  the  General-to-Specific  Pattern  that  I

                   discussed in our previous meetings.



                   Day 42: 04 January 2022

                              I continued working on my lesson plan today. After deciding on what topic to use


                   and searching for online resources, I immediately started writing my lesson plan. It was

                   easy since I already had an idea about how I wanted my demo teaching will go. I decided

                   to use a video analysis activity to introduce my lesson. Also, I included Padlet and Quizizz

                   for the activities since the students already knew how to use them.

                              After checking my co-teachers presentation, I decided to change my PPT template.


                   I realized that it was too plain and did not have an impact on the audience, so I recycled

                   the old template I used in my presentation last semester. It was a simple template but

                   could get the audience’s interest. I remember my former instructor praising me for it. I also

                   made sure that the font color and size were readable. I also prepared my activities from

                   Padlet and Quizizz. It was an easy task, and I finished it in no time.

                   check. She did not give any feedback and left me on reading, but I understand since she

                   is also busy. I asked my sister, who is also a teacher, to check my lesson plan and my

                   PowerPoint Presentation. She said it was okay, and my presentation looked great. I was

                   glad to hear it, and it gave me confidence for my upcoming demo teaching.]]></page><page Index="67"><![CDATA[33

                   on Google Meet and tested the platforms that we will use in our demo. After our meeting,

                   I decided to perform an individual dry run to see the whole flow of the class. I also took


                   notes of the possible technical problems that may occur during my demo, such as the

                   sounds, placement of my phone, etc. I hope that my internet connection will be stable

                   during  my  demo  since  I  do  not  have  any  alternative  plan  if  ever  my  internet  provider

                   decides to have maintenance.

                   Day 47: 09 January 2022

                          Today, I finalized my lesson plan and presentation. I double-checked if there were


                   some grammatical errors and other things that I could add to the presentation. After making

                   sure that everything was alright, I sent my lesson plan to our department chair, Ms. Mildred,

                   so they have a copy before my final demo, which is tomorrow.]]></page><page Index="68"><![CDATA[34


                   Day 48: 10 January 2022

                          Finally,  the  wait  is  over.  Today  is  my  scheduled  day  for  final  demonstration

                   teaching. Honestly, I do not feel any nervousness. I feel confident for some reason. Maybe

                   because I was waiting for this moment to be over, I was thinking about the things I would


                   do once this day was over. I was already celebrating in my head. I am not sure if that was

                   a good thing, but it did ease my worries for this day.

                          My demo teaching was scheduled at 2:30 P.M., and I woke up at 11 A.M. Basically,

                   I only had three hours to prepare, but I still managed it, and I even had the remaining time

                   to perform a short dry run. The long wait was over, and fortunately, the class entered the


                   meeting 15 minutes before the scheduled time. I started the discussion just like a regular

                   class. I never mentioned the demo and the panelists, so they would not be pressured.

                   Although  there  were  lots  of  dead  air,  I  believe  I  still  managed  to  deliver  the  lesson

                   effectively. I will elaborate on my experience more in my following reflections (see page

                   40).



                   Day 49: 11 January 2022

                          Today was Ms. Alivia’s final demonstration teaching, so there was no class today

                   to  attend.  I  know  she  will  do  great  in  her  class.  I  know  her,  and  I  have  seen  her

                   improvements throughout our practice teaching. Moreover, I used this time to watch the


                   record of my demo teaching yesterday. I am glad I followed the target time, which is one

                   hour. I also observed that I am more relaxed than on my first day of teaching in Grade 8

                   class. Maybe because I am becoming more used to teaching, I treat it just like a regular

                   class. As I continued watching the recorded meeting, I could say that there were lots of

                   dead air, especially during the activity. But I think it is considerable since the task was


                   about writing a paragraph that requires a quiet environment so the students could focus. I

                   also observed that there were times when I ran out of words and spoke grammatically

                   incorrect sentences. Overall, I could say that I did great, but honestly, I think I could do

                   better than that.]]></page><page Index="69"><![CDATA[35


                   Day 50: 12 January 2022

                          Today was the worst. I was not prepared at all. I almost forgot that it was still my

                   turn to lead the class today. I was still caught up with my demo teaching, and my brain

                   was still in a “rest mode.” I only remembered it ten minutes before the class. Imagine, ten


                   minutes! I have never crammed so fast in my entire life as I did for this day. Fortunately, I

                   only have to review the Grade 8 class today about our previous lesson, which was the one

                   I taught during my demonstration teaching. I edited my PowerPoint Presentation quickly

                   and presented it in class. I remained calm and did not show any sign of panic in front of

                   the students. After that, I told the class to continue or edit their work on Padlet. The meeting


                   ended  quickly  since  the  students  passed  their  work  on  time.  Although  the  class  went

                   smoothly despite being unprepared, I will never cram again. That was a nerve-wracking

                   experience and worse than I felt during my final demo teaching.



                   Day 51: 13 January 2022

                          There was no scheduled class for today, so I decided to work on my teaching

                   portfolio and review my journal entries. While I was in the middle of my work, I received a


                   message from one of my Grade 8 students that made my day. In his message, he showed

                   his gratitude for my two-months internship. Although it was such a short message, it still

                   made me smile throughout the whole day. It felt so rewarding. Honestly, I never expected

                   any of them to show gratitude, knowing that they are quiet in class.

                   Day 52: 14 January 2022

                          Today was Ms. Branzuela’s final demonstration teaching. I am sure that she will

                   do great today, knowing how well-prepared she is. Like Ms. Alivia, she also improved how

                   she speaks in class and delivers the lesson. I asked Ms. Lovely if she needed any help


                   with anything, but she told me I could rest since I had just finished my demo teaching.



                   Day 53: 17 January 2022

                          Ms. Lovely was absent today, so we do not have a class for today. She forgot to

                   tell us ahead of time, so my co-teachers and I waited for nothing. I decided to use this time


                   to check my students’ work. Honestly, I love giving detailed and constructive feedback on

                   their  works.  It  makes  me  feel  like  I  am  doing  something  good  for  the  students  and

                   improving my written skills at the same time.

                          We observed the Grade 7 class today, led by Ms. Branzuela. The activity she used

                   for motivation was enjoyable. It was called “Who wants to be a Millionaire.” The class was

                   active and participative as usual. I guess all of them want to be a millionaire. Kidding aside,


                   Ms. Branzuela did a great job teaching the students. I asked her if I could have a copy of

                   her PowerPoint Presentation, and she gave it to me willingly.]]></page><page Index="71"><![CDATA[37

                          Today was my last meeting with the Grade 8 students. I messaged Ms. Lovely if I

                   could use the remaining time to say goodbye to the students and show them my gratitude.

                   The students were expressive more than usual, and I am so glad that I got to see their

                   faces when Ms. Lovely asked them to open their cameras for my documentation.

                          Today, I just checked my students’ work on Padlet. I noticed that their writings

                   improve when it comes to punctuation usage. They also have unique concepts in their

                   essays. It feels like I did my job.

                          Today is my last observation in Grade 7, which Ms. Branzuela led. She reviewed

                   the students about their previous topic by having a recitation. She also used an exciting

                   application for this activity called “The Hat – Drawing Names.” I could use it for my future

                   presentation. I am glad that I learn things from my co-teachers too.

                   Ms. Lovely — a compilation of the students' gratitude to me as their practice teacher. I did

                   not expect this! I thought my final meeting with them would be the last time I would see


                   their faces. It made me happy. While watching the video, I realized that most of them are

                   great speakers! They have good diction.

                   remaining days of my practice teaching to finalize all the activities of the students I am

                   handling. I recorded their scores on the spreadsheet that Ms. Vicedo provided us. I also

                   used  this  time  to  review  and  work  on  my  teaching  portfolio.  Despite  having  a  severe


                   headache  from  pulling  an  all-nighter,  I  am  still  here,  looking  at  my  screen  while

                   aggressively typing. I deserve a long break once I finish my portfolio!]]></page><page Index="74"><![CDATA[40

                          Today was the final day of my internship. I am overwhelmed with emotions. I am

                   happy that it ended with success, but part of me felt like this was all fake. I cannot get this

                   thought out of my mind. I feel like I never gave my all and could do better if this was in a


                   face-to-face setting. Nonetheless, I am still happy that my internship was finally over so I

                   could focus on my portfolio and other school works.]]></page><page Index="75"><![CDATA[41


                                            COMMON CLASSROOM PROBLEM




                          As hard as distance teaching might be, it is likely even harder for our students.

                   They have gone from classrooms explicitly designed to support learning to bedrooms and

                   kitchen tables where distractions are plentiful, and expert support is not always on hand.

                   It is no surprise that more than a few will be tempted to opt out.

                          One of the problems that I found difficult to handle was the lack of cooperation from

                   the Grade 8 students. They were quiet even before during my observation phase when


                   Ms. Vicedo was still the one leading the class. This was a big problem for me as they knew

                   me to be the quiet student in our class, so making them participate in the discussion would

                   mean that I had to go out of my comfort zone. Do not get me wrong; I am confident when

                   delivering the lesson. However, maintaining an energetic class is one of my weaknesses.

                   I am not good at raising my voice and being that "fun teacher."


                          With  this  classroom  dilemma,  I  concluded  that  unless  thoughtfully  crafted  with

                   intentional  instructional  design  choices,  the  online  class  makes  students  into  passive

                   learners. These poorly motivated students may understand the required lecture content

                   and pass their activities. Still, they cannot often apply what they have studied outside the

                   virtual classroom or establish connections with previously learned material. Students need

                   numerous interactions with new material to digest and absorb it completely. Teachers must

                   engage  students  in  every  lesson's  quality,  breadth,  and  depth  for  learning  to  be  truly


                   effective.

                          After days of preparation, I applied a rule in our class. Using the wheel I made, the

                   students were forced to participate in class, but I also made sure not to pressure them. I

                   told them that if they did not know the answer, they could call one of their classmates to

                   help them. This method was proven effective as I noticed that they started participating in


                   class. I only used this method when no one was motivated to answer. Fortunately, some

                   of the students were participating of their own accord.]]></page><page Index="76"><![CDATA[42


                                           FINAL DEMONSTRATION TEACHING




                          Every time I hear the phrase "final demo," I immediately think of how exhausting

                   and time-consuming it would be for me. I usually listen to students grumble about how

                   much money they spent on a presentation or instructional materials, the precise lesson

                   plan they will have to do, and the right wardrobe for such a task. As a result, I developed

                   a so-called grudge towards the demonstration, but this was due to the reasons mentioned

                   earlier rather than the emotional stress it would bring me.



                          Unfortunately, as a teacher, I know that I will always experience that in school. And

                   now is the "most awaited time" as part of the primary requirement in our program. I felt that

                   an enormous obligation was placed on me, especially since I was assigned to teach Grade

                   8 students who were very passive in class compared to the Grade 7 students. At that


                   moment, however, I do not feel any nervousness. I feel confident for some reason, maybe

                   because I was waiting for this moment to be over. I was thinking about what I would do

                   once this day was over. I was already celebrating in my head. I am not sure if that was a

                   good thing, but it eased my worries that day.



                          The preparations I made for my demonstration teaching took only four days. One

                   could say that it was rushed, but for me, it was enough—two days for preparing the lesson

                   plan and PowerPoint Presentation; and the remaining days were for practicing how I would

                   deliver the lesson. Now that I put it into words, it indeed looked like I did it in a hurry. But

                   to be honest, this worked perfectly for me as I am used to being in a tight situation which

                   made me feel more productive and motivated.



                          The topic was about Problem-Solution patterns. I decided to use the topic we left

                   off in the class instead of choosing another topic. I wanted my final demonstration to be

                   spontaneous, so I never told them anything about what would happen in the class or what

                   the subject was. I just sent them a message in our group chat about who would like to lead

                   the prayer. Honestly, my sister, a public teacher, told me that I should at least prompt my]]></page><page Index="77"><![CDATA[43


                   student about the lesson I am going to teach them. But I felt like I would be faking my final

                   demo if I did that, so I decided to make everything spontaneous and natural.



                          Finally, the day has come. I woke up at 11 A.M., which seemed pretty late since

                   my demo was at 2:00 P.M. However, I could finish my preparation in time, such as placing

                   my phone and setting up my presentation and the link for the meeting. I was also even

                   able to perform a short dry run. Everything was set. All I had to do was to get through it.


                          During  my  virtual  demonstration,  I  could  say  that  I  behaved  extra  authoritative


                   toward my students yet still maintained a low affective environment, thus eliciting students'

                   participation. Although the silence was noticeable in class due to the lack of students'

                   involvement, I tried to call them by their names to move the discussion forward. I already

                   expected that this scenario would happen. I have mentioned this repeatedly in my journal

                   entries about the possibility that the students may not be cooperative in class once my


                   final demonstration comes. And I was not wrong. They were still passive, which made me

                   sad during the discussion. I thought they would be more participative, considering it was

                   my most awaited day in my entire practice teaching. But I did not take it to heart; instead,

                   I remained authoritative and called their names for participation.


                          I believe this situation indeed proves a teacher's commitment and dedication to

                   teaching. If teachers take it negatively when things do not go their way, they cannot call


                   themselves teachers. As they said, teachers are the second parents. They are expected

                   to  be  understanding  and  overcome  undesirable  situations  for  the  betterment  of  the

                   students.


                          Finally, our session went by so quickly that I felt compelled to repeat the task. I


                   received positive feedback from the panelists. The first thing they praised me for was how

                   I presented myself in the meeting. They said that I had improved my appearance, which

                   was honestly flattering. They also noted that the PowerPoint Presentation I made was

                   interesting and engaging.]]></page><page Index="78"><![CDATA[44


                          Furthermore, one of the feedback that I made some reflection on afterward was

                   about how I lack enthusiasm in class. My former instructor told me that I could use an

                   engaging motivational activity considering that the Grade 8 class was not active, which I

                   agree with. However, my instructors knew me as a quiet student, and they praised me for


                   the progress I had made when it came to speaking and delivering the lesson.


                          Overall, I believe that I did give all my best to succeed in my final demonstration

                   teaching. There  was  a  decent  conversation,  no technical  difficulties,  and the  students'

                                     OVERALL REFLECTION AND SELF-APPRAISAL




                          After my teaching internship at New Generation International School, I can say that

                   I have grown and improved significantly. I have learned a lot about communication and

                   teaching  abilities,  workplace  adaption,  developing  new  learning  materials,  refining  my

                   personality,  and  operating  cooperatively  with  my  students  and  cooperating  teachers.

                   Despite the pandemic, I am grateful for the opportunity to obtain valuable experience as

                   an actual teacher at the said school.


                          I recall being both excited and frightened the first time I was in charge of a class.

                   After years of studying in the program, the sense of finally having the opportunity to work

                   with real students is overwhelming. It was nerve-wracking since I was afraid of crowds, but

                   I also wanted to give my students the best. So, before the discussion, I did a lot of practice.

                   To ensure that I do not make any mistakes, I virtually memorize every phrase in every


                   slide of my presentation. I had questions about my abilities and capabilities since I decided

                   to pursue this program, but not until I had to deal with my students. I had no idea how my

                   anxiety limited the things I could contribute and learn as a teacher. After being comfortable

                   in the class, I noticed and comprehended the learnings I could obtain from this internship.

                   It is great to know that your work is being heard and enjoyed by real students. Back then,

                   in our previous semesters, we used to conduct a demonstration teaching with no actual

                   students. It was just my classmates and me. I was talking to my make-believe students.


                   Because of this, I could not see how I was doing in class. I had no idea which parts I

                   needed to fix. Now that I have completed my teaching internship, I can assess whether or

                   not I am a competent teacher to my students.

                          Honestly, this was not what I had anticipated when I started the program. I expect

                   to be standing in front of a four-cornered room full of students attentively listening to my


                   presentation. Because most of the things we studied and practiced on campus were based

                   on face-to-face classes, it is somewhat different. Before, you can observe your students,

                   their  body  language,  and  gestures.  We  can  also  easily  manage  the  classroom]]></page><page Index="80"><![CDATA[46


                   environment. However, the setting given to us was difficult to manage. But as they said, a

                   teacher must be flexible. I learned to adapt in the classroom. Despite being in an online

                   class, I learned how to keep my students focused, organized, and attentive. I started each

                   day with motivational activities and quotations.


                          In terms of the lesson discussion, I was amazed by how far I had come in such a

                   short period. I was scared when I started teaching, so I stuttered a lot. It was particularly

                   challenging because I constantly expended much effort in discussions to speak clearly. I

                   was also blind to my grammatical faults and misuse of certain words. One of the panelists

                   made this remark about my final demonstration instruction. As an English major, it was


                   initially humiliating, but I understood it was not helping me grow. All I can do is practice

                   and focus on my development. Practice is beneficial, as I discovered after only a few

                   meetings.

                          Moreover, my patience was also tested throughout my internship. When things do

                   not go as planned, I quickly become irritated. If I made a mistake or could not correct

                   something,  I  became  swiftly  annoyed.  However,  I  prolonged  my  patience  without

                   recognizing it, which surprised me. After assessing myself during my teaching time, I never


                   got irritated when I ran into issues like a bad internet connection. Perhaps it is because I

                   have been used to speaking in front of the class since I was first introduced to it. When a

                   student  misbehaved  or  refused  to  comply  with  their  activities,  I  was  able  to  keep  my

                   emotions  in  check.  I  make  every  effort  to  avoid  appearing  intimidating.  As  a  result,

                   whenever I try to contact them to remind them of their missing outputs, I make sure that


                   my message or approach seems approachable and appropriate. I do not want my students

                   to think that I am strict and inconsiderate. I can be firm depending on the circumstances,

                   but I believe I am a genuine person.

                          Overall, if I were to assess and compare myself from the beginning to now, I could

                   say that I have made significant progress. This success results from a collaborative effort

                   amongst  many  people,  including  my  professors,  instructors,  co-practice  teachers,

                   cooperating teacher, and students. I was having doubts about myself, and these people]]></page><page Index="81"><![CDATA[47


                   helped me overcome them. They helped me overcome my fears and weaknesses. I may

                   still be missing certain things, but it represents my desire to learn more. I'm excited for

                   more opportunities to expand my skills and experience and become a better teacher.

                          Confucius once said, "If your plan is for one year, plant rice; if your plan is for ten


                   years, plant a tree; but if your plan is for eternity, educate children." Education today plays

                   a critical role in the transformation of young people. We do not live in a vacuum. What we

                   do, from stepping on a flower or burning fuel for energy to the way we speak and what we

                   listen  to,  all  have  consequences  as  we  live  in  a  society.  We  are  part  of  society.  Our

                   community influences us to the extent that we allow ourselves to be influenced by it. Events


                   and people with whom we interact affect our beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors somehow.

                   We, in turn, contribute to the shaping of society - its events, people, and destiny.

                          Furthermore, several studies have discovered massive dropouts in many schools

                   around the country, if not the world. As future educators, we ask ourselves, "What and

                   how can we assist in reducing such common concerns in a school setting?" We could

                   make a significant contribution by providing service and dedication to our learners. This

                   implies that we must provide unwavering support and encouragement to them. We should


                   do it out of pure passion and joy, not because it is required of us.

                          To put it another way, being a teacher is one of the most important jobs we can

                   have.  Our  mission,  a  responsibility  assigned  to  us  in  this  world,  is  to  teach.  We  are

                   expected  to  contribute  to  the  betterment  of  the  world  in  our  unique  way  due  to  our

                   individuality. In the profession where we are prepared, our individuality can be the most


                   significant contribution to the humanization of life on Earth.

                          Our long and challenging time of preparation, ongoing professional growth and

                   education, and devotion to ethical and moral ideals all play a role in the quality of our

                   professional service. If we provide professional service, mediocrity will not be tolerated. A

                   profound and fulfilled life may not be far behind if we live up to our title as professional

                   educators. This is undeniably possible when teaching has become our passion.]]></page><page Index="82"><![CDATA[48

                              I am Noren B. Alivia. I was born on September 17, 1999. I grew up in Lucena

                       City,  Quezon,  my  father's  hometown.  I  am  Mr.  Antonio  and  Mrs.  Melissa  Alivia's

                       youngest child of three. My father was a construction worker, while my mother had

                       different jobs like housekeeping and babysitting.

                              I graduated my primary level at Elvira Razon Aranilla Elementary School, then


                       took my early junior high school at Lucena City National High School. I enjoyed joining

                       in extracurricular activities like theater artists, choir, and table tennis for sports. When

                       my father died in junior high, I had to move to Manila to continue my studies. I finished

                       junior high school at Doña Teodora High School in Sta. Cruz, Manila. I am one of the

                       pioneers of the K-12 Curriculum, so I took the opportunity of studying free in a private

                       school for the senior high school level. I did not regret choosing Philippine College of


                       Criminology  because  it  helped  me  excel  in  my  academics  and  graduated  with  an

                       award. My teachers are so great that they made me want to become one. So now, I

                       am currently a graduating student in the program Bachelor of Secondary Education-

                       English at Cavite State University- Tanza Campus.

                              I am working hard to fulfill my goals for myself and my family. I want to achieve

                       my dreams while doing what I love, including teaching.

                       Dear Readers,

                              This  portfolio  summarizes  my  entire  practice  teaching  experience  at  New

                       Generation International School – Trece Martires, Cavite.

                              With this portfolio, you will be able to witness my endeavor on my internship

                       journey. It will show my days as a Pre-service teacher and how I learned to work with


                       other people. I can say that there is significant growth in me as an individual and as an

                       educator because of the hardships and struggles that I conquered.

                              We are in an online setting because of the pandemic, but it did not hinder us

                       from  learning  and  sharing  learnings  with  our  students.  You  will  see  how  we  build

                       connections with our students and get along with them. With this portfolio, you will also

                       come across how I overcame my fear of crowds. I am anxious when being observed.


                       But with the help of my co-teachers, students, and cooperating teacher, I overcame

                       that fear.

                              With this simple portfolio, I hope that you will gain a lot of knowledge not just

                       inside the classroom but also in my life experience. This portfolio is my gem. I hope

                       that you will learn something and use it in your journey. Thank you!

                              To my loving and supportive family for their support, financial assistance, love,

                       advice, and encouragement. You are my inspiration in everything that I do.

                              And  above  all,  to  our  Almighty  God,  for  His  unconditional  love  and  all  the

                       blessings, He is showering upon me. With love and gratitude, I thank Him for guiding


                       me during my journey and making this internship possible.

                                  EXPECTATION ON THE STUDENT TEACHING PROGRAM




                              Working in the field of education is not always easy. As teachers, we must

                       expect many encounters to prepare ourselves for what is coming. This endeavor would

                       bring me into actual practice, so I am looking forward to the following months of my

                       career as a Pre-service teacher.

                              I am already expecting that this teacher-student would be exciting. My students


                       just graduated from the elementary level, so it would be easy to make them participate

                       in the class activities. Their age ranges from 12-14 years old; they are still young but

                       able to handle new websites that we might use in online meetings. In this teaching

                       program, I want to apply strategies that I have learned. New interactive sites allow

                       teachers to create instructional materials for the class. I wanted to try connecting my

                       teaching strategies to those sites and use them in class.


                              I  am  also  looking  forward  to  building  a  harmonious  connection  with  my

                       students. Building a good teacher-student relationship in the classroom can prevent

                       students from lacking confidence and motivation in class.  My students must know that

                       as their teacher, I will support and be close to them, but in a sense that they will not be

                       overly dependent. I want to teach my students that their teacher is just a guide, and

                       they must also know how to stand on their own. I believe that every student can learn

                       with a bit of perseverance and inspiration from their teacher.


                              Most  importantly,  as  a  Preservice  teacher,  I  expect  to  learn  a  lot  from  our

                       cooperating teacher and cooperating school. We are mostly done learning by the book;

                       I am looking forward to learning through experience with the help of our cooperating

                       teacher. I still lack experience in handling the actual class, so I expect that I will be

                       better after this internship.  I want to know how to manage class situations and learn


                       from their experience. These are things that I am looking forward to. With all of these,

                       I know that there will be more things that I will go through to learn. Because of that, I

                       am so excited to start this journey as a Preservice teacher.]]></page><page Index="136"><![CDATA[2


                                       REFLECTION ON CLASSROOM OBSERVATION




                              For two weeks, we had the opportunity to observe the online English classes

                       of the 7th and 8th Grade of New Generation International School- Trece Martires City.

                       We learned how the class works in the institution before we handled their English

                       classes.  This  includes  their  classroom  management,  instructional  strategies,

                       classroom environment, formulation of lesson plans, and assessment of lessons. It


                       also involves observation of the students and cooperating school mentioned above.

                              For classroom management, Ms. Vicedo uses an effective way to make the

                       students interested, engaged, and focused. I can say that despite the setting, she can

                       connect with the students and keep them focused on the lessons. I observed that Ms.

                       Vicedo starts her class with a good tone of voice. She always  greets and asks the

                       students  about  their  day.  She  can  also  keep  up  with  the  fun  and  laughter  of  the


                       students. It exposes how the students can be themselves in their class. It is the reason

                       why they are always energized throughout their English class. Sometimes, they play

                       games and activities before the class begins. As a result, students quickly acquire

                       complicated lessons because they are actively participating in class.

                              Regarding the discipline problems, she only has a few. In an online setting,

                       there are uninspected circumstances. Some students open their microphones even

                       when they are not being called. It is usually just an accident for students to tap or click


                       their unmute button. However, it still causes distraction in the class, especially when

                       the  student  does  not  notice  it  immediately.  Another  one  is  the  camera;  since  the

                       institution is a private school, most can open their camera. Ms. Vicedo always reminds

                       them to open it so she can see who is not listening in the class. Some don't open it,

                       and Ms. Vicedo has to mention their names. It is an effective way to see if the students


                       are focused because, in this setting, there are a lot of things that can cause distraction.

                              Ms. Vicedo has a good technique when it comes to her instructional strategies.

                       She has different teaching strategies depending on the lesson. Sometimes she uses]]></page><page Index="137"><![CDATA[3


                       the traditional method of instruction. In the online setting, this is the easiest method.

                       Ms. Vicedo usually does this; she directly instructs and lectures the lessons to the

                       students.  To  ensure  that  the  students  are  listening,  she  makes  them  repeat  the

                       information that she just gave them. She also consistently asks questions to make the


                       class interactive. Especially in literature, students do not like being asked to answer in

                       long sentences. However, Ms. Vicedo can make them talk because of her questions.

                       I also observed that in the Grade 8 class, the students are not that active. Ms. Vicedo

                       has a strategy to make her students talk. It is by doing interactive discussion. It is a

                       way of discussing the lesson by giving out real-life situations. When Ms. Vicedo uses


                       relatable  and  timely  situations  in  class,  the  students  are  able  to  share  their  own

                       experiences. It is a great strategy to make shy and low-esteemed students answer the

                       situations because there is no right or wrong output. I want to learn how Ms. Vicedo

                       gives her students thought-provoking questions that make them think for themselves.

                       They are able to compare, collaborate, and discuss their experiences connected to the

                       lesson.

                              Collaborative or group activities can be difficult in the online setting, so this


                       teaching strategy is rarely used in class. It is only used in motivational activities where

                       we are not recording the tasks of the students. With that, Ms.Vicedo rather guides and

                       allows her students to become independent in working with their activities. Each class

                       has different types of students; they have different learning styles as well. As a teacher,

                       it is difficult to fulfill all those learning styles. Using individual activities, we are able to


                       touch  our  student’s  uniqueness.  This  is  the  strategy  that  Ms.  Vicedo  did  in  her

                       activities. She gives her students time to do their work, but she also guides them with

                       some questions. Teachers must guide their students but teach them to be independent

                       as well.

                              The  classroom  environment  is  a  challenge  in  the  online  setting.  New

                       Generation International School is using Google Meet as their medium of discussion.

                       This  serves  as  their  classroom  for  the  meantime  because  of  the  pandemic.  This,]]></page><page Index="138"><![CDATA[4


                       however, does not hinder their teachers from having a good learning environment for

                       the students. Ms. Vicedo can make the class motivated. She is doing it by speaking

                       her student's language and by acting like they are still in the real classroom. She uses

                       terms that the students can understand and relate to in the student's language when


                       discussing. By the traditional classroom approach, she makes the student open their

                       camera, so everyone can see each other. These strategies in their environment made

                       the students feel connected to their teacher and their classmates, despite the distance.

                              Another good thing about their classroom environment is the medium itself, the

                       Google Meeting, and its features. The GMeet is an accessible website that students


                       can easily operate. I like that they are using this instead of Zoom because it is more

                       suitable for the students to use. Although sometimes, in this setting, it is difficult to

                       maintain a good classroom environment all throughout the class. Because teachers

                       cannot fully control the inside of the room, I observed that there are students that drop

                       their call when they are being called in the class. They are leaving the meeting because

                       they don't want to answer the questions being asked. Mostly, the common reason is

                       that they did not listen to the discussion because of the distractions; they do not know


                       how  to  answer  their  teacher.  Students  can  easily  say  that  it  was  the  internet

                       connection. However, teachers can see the same students doing the same thing over

                       and over. Still, the teacher must be understanding because there are real students that

                       suffer from a bad internet connection. This is the tricky part when teaching in an online

                       class. Despite the efforts of teachers to make the class interactive and motivating,


                       there are still students who are difficult to monitor because they are still distracted in

                       their own homes. So, I agree with Ms. Vicedo's policy that students who  have the

                       capacity to open their cameras must open theirs. It will lessen the opportunity for the

                       students to be distracted in class.

                              The  New  Generation  International  School  does  not  require  its  teachers  to

                       create lesson plans when teaching. I think it is their way to lessen the administrative

                       work of the teachers. Because of that, the teachers rely on the books provided by the]]></page><page Index="139"><![CDATA[5


                       school. They create PowerPoint presentations to teach, and they gather additional

                       information  from  the  internet.  However,  we  are  still  Pre-service  teachers,  and  the

                       school encourages and requires us to create a learning plan for each lesson that we

                       are teaching. The school did not give a format of the learning plan, so we used the


                       semi-detailed format that we have been using since our  1st year in the program. I

                       already know that it is easier for us to formulate objectives, activities, and assessments

                       because we are practiced in that format so well by our instructors and professors on

                       campus. Still, we are instructed by our cooperating teacher to submit each lesson plan

                       before we go through the discussion so she will know the information and activities


                       that need revision.

                              Although the book provides lessons and activities, there are still downsides

                       when teachers do not use learning plans. I observe negative situations when we do

                       not have learning plans ahead of us. First, there is a lack of classroom guidance. There

                       are situations in class where the discussion is going out of the context of the lesson.

                       Planning is essential, so we know the  step-by-step process of the discussion. The

                       lesson  plan  is  like  a  path  walk  that  would  let  us  reach  a  destination,  except  our


                       destination is the objective of the lesson.  Since there is no planning, most of the time,

                       the  class  starts  right  away  to  the  lesson  proper  and  skips  motivational  activities.

                       Motivational  activities  might  not  be  recorded,  but  it  is  also  a  fundamental  thing  to

                       motivate and stimulate the students. I know that teachers have a lot of work, so they

                       might not have the time to prepare for these kinds of activities. However, it will also be


                       a waste of time and effort if the students are motivated and guided in each class. It is

                       our top priority as teachers to make the students acquire our lesson's objective. The

                       state of readiness is essential in order to make our students'  hearts and enthusiasm

                       for learning. Another thing is when we don’t have a learning plan and just follow the

                       book. I find out that the objectives are too many and too broad. It causes students to

                       miss out on the specific objectives that they must acquire. Most of the time, there are

                       also one or two domains of objectives that are not achieved.]]></page><page Index="140"><![CDATA[6


                              In  the  assessment  of  lessons,  teachers  also  follow  the  books.  However,

                       sometimes books provide activities that are not suitable for the online environment

                       because it is still anchored in the traditional setting. Thus, the teachers formulate their

                       own  assessments  for  the  students.  Ms.  Vicedo  uses  the  traditional  way  of  giving


                       assessments  to  her  students.  The  assessment  is  usually  multiple  choice  or

                       identification presented in a PowerPoint. Then, the students would copy and answer

                       the questions in their notebooks. After checking, the students send the pictures of their

                       assessment via messenger chat. At first, I thought the approach was not  practical,

                       time-consuming, and too old. Usually, teachers would use google forms in the online


                       class because it is convenient when answering and checking. However, Ms. Vicedo

                       explained that in this approach, the students would have a better understanding of the

                       questions because while writing, they are also reading. The copy of the assessment

                       also serves as their reviewer when they have examinations. So, I think sometimes I

                       would use this approach.

                              The class that I handled was Grade-7 Brazil. I observed in the first sit-in, and

                       when we introduced ourselves in the class, the students were so nice and active. The


                       nervousness that I was feeling was gone because they welcomed us so well. Before

                       the pandemic began, they were still elementary level. I think that is the reason why

                       they still have the energy of elementary students. Whenever Ms. Vicedo discusses her

                       lessons, the students show their joy and excitement in the recitation. It is also good

                       that Ms. Vicedo can keep up with the fun, but she builds a barrier so that students


                       know how to respect their teacher. I also observed that I could use their energy in the

                       motivation phase, so I am excited to handle them. The cooperating school is also as

                       welcoming as the students. When we met our cooperating teacher, she introduced us

                       to  other  New  Generation  International  School  faculty  members.  They  are  already

                       congratulating  us  even  before  we  start  handling  students.  I  am  glad  that  we  are

                       assigned in Grade 7; I  am grateful for being handled by Ms. Vicedo and the New

                       Generation International School.]]></page><page Index="141"><![CDATA[7


                              SELF-ASSESSMENT ON READINESS IN THE ACTUAL TEACHING




                              During the observation phase, I have been planning a lot on how I  am going

                       to handle the class. There are some strategies from my cooperating teacher that I will

                       continue to employ, but I also have a lot of techniques from our program that I can

                       apply in the class.

                              In every lesson that I will be teaching, I will always base it on the curriculum


                       that the school is following. In NGIS, they are using the book as their basis in teaching,

                       and we are just going to add more information from the web when needed. I hope that

                       my students will accomplish and understand the concepts of the lesson for them to

                       follow instructions on our activities. I must guide them, especially with fundamental

                       concepts  of  the  English  language,  so  they  can  deeply  analyze  and  practice  the

                       lessons. My students have a range of abilities; they are talented in different aspects. It


                       is  important  that  in  lessons,  I  must  offer  choices  to  the  students  so  they  will  be

                       encouraged to participate in the class. For every topic in a unit, I should prepare various

                       motivational  activities  that  would  touch  those  talents.  I  will  always  begin  the  class

                       through creative visual displays and interactive activities. I have observed that teachers

                       can boost the energy of the students with those things, and since it is an online setting,

                       we can use manipulative displays.  I will ensure that students will spend their time

                       hands-on with their activities and assessments. After every class, I will prepare a short


                       quiz or reflection to know if they understood the lessons. Upon the closing of the class,

                       I would review the class before giving them assignments. It is a recorded assignment

                       upon the policy of our cooperating teacher. It is to know whether they achieved the

                       objectives, so I can proceed with the activities at the next meeting.

                              With all these plans and preparations, I would know that I succeeded when I


                       observed that my students acquired the needed goals in every lesson. It would also

                       assure me when my cooperating teacher imparts on how I am teaching the class.]]></page><page Index="142"><![CDATA[8

                       Day 1: 07 October 2021
















                                                First meeting with Grade 7-Brazil

                              This is our first time meeting the students as well as our cooperating teacher,

                       Ms.  Lovely  Wendy  Vicedo.  We  only  talked  to  our  CT  through  email  and  private

                       messages before the virtual classroom meeting. Ms. Vicedo is good with students, and

                       her teaching style is very timely. She is also nice and approachable; that's why I am

                       very excited and thrilled to learn from her. Yesterday, Ms. Vicedo told us that we were

                       going  to  introduce  ourselves  to  our  students  before  the  class  started.  I  felt  the


                       excitement; I am also nervous because, despite our previous activities in the university,

                       this is the first time that we are going to have actual high school students. Even when

                       it is in an online setting or virtually, it is difficult to identify the students' expressions.

                       But as we introduced ourselves in the class, the students were nice and interactive.

                       The nervous feelings were gone because they welcomed us so well. In our class in


                       college, since we've been in an online class as well, students like us are not that active

                       in this setting. So, I am glad that our students actively participate in class while Ms.

                       Vicedo teaches them. The first day went great. I did not expect how our students would

                       react on our first day of observation. Ms. Vicedo told us that some students are still

                       shy, but to me, the class is already active compared to other classes. It is also good to

                       handle a significant number of students so that we can practice the real scenarios that

                       are happening in the class. Thus, I am excited for the following days, weeks, and


                       months that are coming in this class.]]></page><page Index="143"><![CDATA[9


                       Day 2: 08 October 2021


















                                                  Activity day of Grade 7-Brazil

                              Ms. Vicedo informed us that the English class on each Grade level meets two

                       times every week. The first meeting is the discussion day, and then the 2nd one will

                       be the activity day. Today is an Activity Day. Ms. Vicedo made sure that the class was

                       prepared for the seatwork. She recalled the lesson from the previous meeting before

                       handing over the PowerPoint presentation of activities. The teacher made sure that

                       the students were diligent enough to answer it on their own. While the students were


                       taking the seatwork, I observed that they were so quiet. It is good that the class has

                       fewer distractions while in class.



                       Day 03: 11 October 2021

                              We do not have a synchronous class today. Since we are still in the observation


                       phase and we do not have a class, I occupied myself with preparing the resources that

                       I  will  be  using  in  the  class.  In  the  previous  semester,  we  took  an  Educational

                       Technology course, and we were introduced to different kinds of websites that could

                       really help in teaching our students. I am really glad because that course is very useful

                       in this type of setting. I tried exploring websites such as CC Search and DuckDuckGo.

                       They are both search engines. Other than Google, which we usually use, I will also

                       use  those  sites  that  I  mentioned  for  more  information.  It  was  great  because  our


                       cooperating teacher told us to use other resources and not just the book that we were

                       going to borrow from her.]]></page><page Index="144"><![CDATA[10


                       Day 04: 12 October 2021

                              Ms. Vicedo recalled the previous lesson to the students. It seems like they

                       understood  and  studied  it  very  well  because  they  could  answer  their  teacher's

                       questions. I like where Ms. Vicedo gave an activity then the students used that lesson


                       in a conversation with their peers. I remember that our professor told us that in order

                       for us to learn a language, we must use and practice it. So, this technique that Ms.

                       Vicedo used is very effective on the students’ capability to grasp the lesson. Today,

                       we also experienced some technical difficulties. Ms. Vicedo let the students turn off

                       their cameras to lessen the bandwidth. These are the things that we can’t easily avoid


                       in this setting. I hope that the face-to-face class could come back already to prevent

                       these scenarios.



                       Day 05: 13 October 2021














                                             Grade 8- Finland completion of activities


                              Ms. Vicedo and the Grade 8 students completed the activity that they were not

                       able to finish at the last meeting. Since the periodic examination of the students is near,

                       Ms. Vicedo helped them to review their lessons. She has been reminding the students

                       to write the correct answers to their activity. In this manner, the students can remember

                       which part of the activity they made a mistake, so they can recall the right answer in


                       the examination. I have observed that this Grade level is not as interactive as the 7th

                       Grade, maybe because of maturity or just because there are only nine students in their

                       class.]]></page><page Index="145"><![CDATA[11


                       Day 06: 15 October 2021



























                                      Review for the periodic examination of Grade 7-Brazil

                              Ms. Vicedo and the students reviewed all of the lessons of the 1st quarter. It is


                       for the incoming periodic exam. The students were active and clarified all the confusion

                       that  they had.  This  is a  great  way  to  make sure  that  the  students  understand  the

                       lessons very well and have a good score on their exams.

                              Ms.  Vicedo  also  reminisced  on  the  face-to-face  classes.  She said  that  she

                       misses the students in their school. I really hope that it will come back soon. The class


                       also had an activity. I observed that there were students that kept on asking questions

                       even if Ms. Vicedo had already told the instructions. I think we really need patience in

                       this setting because the student's attention span is not that long. Nonetheless, it was

                       a fun day.]]></page><page Index="146"><![CDATA[12


                       Day 07: 18 October 2021

                              We had to meet our cooperating teacher today. We are about to start handling

                       the students, so we need a book for our lessons. The school looks great. They followed

                       the health protocols before allowing us to enter the premises. The smell of a school is


                       different. I wish that we could handle and see our students face to face. We could have

                       fun and bond with them.

                              When we met Ms. Vicedo, she was very approaching. She explained how the

                       class works and how we can add some information in discussions, not just follow what

                       is in the book. She gave us the books and other handouts to use in the class.




                       Day 08: 19 October 2021























                                 Practice questions for the periodic examination of Grade 7-Brazil

                              The Grade 7 students reviewed for the incoming exam. The students were a


                       bit  confused  with  singular  and  plural  verbs,  so  Ms.  Vicedo  explained  it  again.  In

                       reviewing the lessons, I observed that Ms. Vicedo does not use visual aids. I think

                       some  of  the  students  can’t  understand  or  can’t  hear  her  because  of  the  internet

                       connection. It could be a factor that the students seemed confused with the practice

                       questions that Ms. Vicedo gave them. Some students should see something on the

                       screen for them to follow what the teacher is saying. But again, the internet connection

                       hindered us from doing it.]]></page><page Index="147"><![CDATA[13


                       Day 09: 20 October 2021


























                                            Preparation of the instructional materials

                              Today is the start of the first periodic exam for our students. We do not have a

                       class, but we are still preparing for our first lesson for the next quarter. I have been

                       thinking of ways how to build a rapport in this class. It is difficult because we are in an

                       online setting. I searched for ideas that could make my students actively interact with

                       me. Activities and games would be a great strategy to make it happen. The students

                       are very much into computer games, so games would be an effective tool.


                              As I prepared my Instructional Materials, I used the format that Ms. Vicedo sent

                       us. This is how they present their PowerPoint presentation in the class. She didn't give

                       a lesson plan format since they don't create one. They follow the book. However, she

                       still encouraged us to create a lesson plan, so we used the 4A format. It is a good thing

                       because we have been using that format on the campus since we were in 1st year.]]></page><page Index="148"><![CDATA[14


                       Day 10: 21 October 2021

                              We don't have a class today. However, a teacher's job does not revolve only

                       around the class meetings. The students are still taking their examinations. To make

                       this day productive, I searched for the DepEd channel on YouTube. It is a channel


                       where teachers and students can watch the lessons that we are about to teach each

                       quarter. As a teacher, it would help me to have new ideas and teaching styles that I

                       can use in our class. I listed some of the activities that the students can use in our

                       discussions. Ms. Vicedo mentioned that the students have a hard time recitation when

                       the topic is about literature. So, I took it as a basis for how to make it easier for them


                       to participate in the activities that I prepared.



                       Day 11: 22 October 2021

                              The online class is a difficult setting to handle, especially when we do it the first

                       time. Every time we prepare for the class, we have to make sure that our materials are

                       decent when presented. We also had to make sure that it was working well when

                       common  problems  or  circumstances  came.  Today,  that's  what  I  did.  I  asked  Ms.


                       Branzuela if we could check the materials that I will be using for the next meeting.

                       There I discovered that my presentation's audio does not work. I had the chance to fix

                       it before presenting it in the actual meeting. I am glad that I checked it first because it

                       is going to be difficult if I consume the time to fix the problem of my presentation.]]></page><page Index="149"><![CDATA[15


                       Day 12: 03 November 2021















                                  Completion of activities and discussion day of Grade 8-Finland

                              Today is the 1st day of Grade 8 for the second quarter. Ms. Vicedo checked if


                       the students passed their activities last quarter. Students who are not able to submit

                       their activities may have the chance to fail the subject. In the online setting, a lot of

                       students don't know how to manage their time. The teachers also can't check if they

                       are really the ones who are doing those activities. So, we need to have strategies to

                       make them do their tasks with honesty. One of the struggles also is that some of the

                       students don't cooperate in the recitation. However, Ms. Vicedo showed an approach

                       in that students would participate. Instead of voluntarily raising their hands, she would


                       call someone to answer. She also used pictures for the students to analyze that made

                       them active in class.



                       Day 13: November 04, 2021

                              We don't have a class today because it is Thursday. Tomorrow will be the first

                       time I will be handling the students in this internship. I feel so excited and nervous at


                       the same time because I am about to experience real students. We are used to just

                       presenting and imagining that we have students whenever we have a demo teaching

                       requirement. So, I made sure to build rapport before going straight to the lesson. The

                       game that I am preparing will require the students to participate in class. I noticed that

                       when Ms. Vicedo was teaching them, some really did not open their mic and camera

                       to join the activity. So, I made sure that no students would be left behind in the prepared


                       activity. I hope that they will enjoy it as much as I imagine it.]]></page><page Index="150"><![CDATA[16


                       Day 14: November 05, 2021




















                                             My first time handling the Grade 7-Brazil


                       Today  is  the  day  that  I  handled  the  Grade  7-Brazil.  I  am  so  thrilled  with  how  the

                       students interact with me. They are so active, and it is so fun to talk to them before we

                       actually begin the lesson. Since it is their first lesson this quarter, I gave them a game

                       that  is  connected  to  the  lesson.  It  is  called  online  charades.  I  really  think  that  the

                       students enjoyed it because they were cooperating, laughing, and smiling on their

                       screens.

                       When I started the topic for today, the students listened attentively. I know it because


                       they asked questions and answered questions that I gave them. The lesson is quite

                       long because it is about literature. But in order to make the class active, I've been

                       asking questions to them. Ms. Vicedo also informed me that the students aren’t too

                       interested in literature, so I took it into consideration when I was discussing it.

                                  After the class, I felt so tired. Since I had been talking for one and a half hours,


                       my energy got consumed by the class. However, that tiredness is overpowered by

                       fulfillment. It is so fulfilling to have real students listening and enjoying what you have

                       prepared. Because before, we had a demonstration of teaching without students. I was

                       just talking to my imaginary students. Now, I can evaluate if I have become an effective

                       teacher to my students.]]></page><page Index="151"><![CDATA[17


                       Day 15: 08 November 2021

























                                 Completion of activities and discussion day of Grade 8- Finland

                              I am only handling Grade 7 class; Grade 8 is handled by Ms. Diaz, so today, I

                       am only observing their class. Before the class started, Ms. Vicedo reminded the class

                       of the activities they hadn't submitted yet. I think it is already the computation of the


                       student's grades for the 1st quarter, which is why Ms. Vicedo has been reminding them

                       to complete their work.

                                  After  the  class,  I  checked  the  assignment  that  I  gave  to  Grade  7-Brazil

                       yesterday. Some of them haven't submitted it because the due date is still on Tuesday.

                       The assignment that I gave them was an activity in the book. I observed that some of

                       the students had a hard time answering it because of the different and deeper sentence

                       structure. So, I'll consider it when I review them at the next meeting.]]></page><page Index="152"><![CDATA[18


                       Day 16: 09 November 2021


























                                              First activity day with Grade 7- Brazil

                              Today is the activity day of the first lesson that I discussed. Before the class

                       started, Ms. Vicedo informed me that I would be the one to send the classroom link to

                       the students. It means that I am going to admit them to the class. It is my first time

                       hosting a virtual classroom, so I explored the website.

                              We had a quick review of the previous lesson before I gave them the activities.

                       I also prepared a supplementary video on the part where some of them got confused.


                       When the class was ready, I gave them the first activity. It was Identification. I gave

                       them some time to answer quietly. Then, we checked it, and many got good scores.

                       The next activity is the application of the lesson. I introduced them to a new website

                       called Padlet. It is a good site where they can post and customize the things they share.

                       Some of them asked questions about the site, which I love because it means that they

                       are really into it. They are able to express the things that they want through a poem

                       and share it with their classmates. Overall, the class enjoyed the activity I prepared


                       while applying the lesson that we discussed.]]></page><page Index="153"><![CDATA[19


                       Day 17: 10 November 2021


























                                          The first time that Ms. Diaz handled her class

                              The class of Grade 8 is until the afternoon, so I checked the class record of

                       Grade 7-Brazil first. Some students haven't submitted their assignments and activities.

                       Most of them are absentees, so I decided to remind them of the things they need to

                       submit. It is difficult in the online setting when the student is not able to attend the

                       class. So, I am giving them consideration on the activities they need to comply with.

                              It was the first time that Ms. Diaz handled her class in the afternoon. We were


                       informed that Grade 8 is not an active class, so she needed a strategy to make them

                       participate in the discussion. She introduced herself in the class, as well as the rules

                       that she wanted to implement on them. She understands that some of them can't or

                       don't want to open their camera. However, she also mentioned that they need to make

                       sure that they are listening and are able to answer the questions she will give them.

                       One thing that I like is that she used a roulette of names and points in the recitation. It

                       was  effective  because  the  class  became  active,  and  they  really  listened  to  the


                       discussion.]]></page><page Index="154"><![CDATA[20


                       Day 18: 11 November 2021

                              When  we  asked  our  cooperating  teacher  about  the  grading  system  of  the

                       school, she said that class participation covers 40% of it. She also gave us the list of

                       the students on a spreadsheet, so we were able to record the activities right away. We


                       are worried about the Grade 8 class because they are not as active as needed. There

                       are a lot of factors to consider. First, the online setting lets the students rely on others

                       to participate in class and ends up with no one playing a part at all. Then, students'

                       attention span is shorter because of the distraction of their surroundings and the social

                       media that they can freely open. These are the things that I have been thinking about


                       while recording the activities of the students. Face-to-face class is difficult enough to

                       handle, but the online setting makes it even harder for the teachers and students.



                       Day 19: 12 November 2021



















                                             Teaching grammar with Grade 7- Brazil

                              Today I got to observe Ms. Branzuela's class. One of our professors told us


                       that teaching grammar is complicated for language teachers because it is complicated.

                       Ms. Branzuela showed the students an easier way how to understand the lesson for

                       today. She used an inductive approach, wherein she gave a lot of examples that let

                       the  student  identify  the  different  types  of  phrases.  This  is  an  effective  approach

                       because the students seem to understand the lesson very well. Ms. Branzuela also let

                       the students speak up, so interactive the class.]]></page><page Index="155"><![CDATA[21

                                        Ms. Diaz reviewing the class before the activities

                              Today  is  Grade  8's  activity  day.  As  usual,  Ms.  Diaz  reviewed  the  previous

                       lesson before giving them the activities that she prepared. Ms. Diaz also used a Padlet


                       for the activity that she gave them. The Grade 8 students quietly took their time in doing

                       the activity. They must have enjoyed the website's tool in posting because they ran out

                       of  time  to  finish  the  activity.  Ms.  Diaz  gave  a  deadline  for  their  activity  and  their

                       assignment, and she reminded them of the importance of submitting their work on time.

                              This is the activity day of Grade 7-Brazil for their lesson about Phrases. Before

                       they started, Ms. Branzuela introduced the Quizziz website. They are going to review

                       the previous lesson with the help of the site mentioned. The students' scores are not

                       recorded, but those who have the highest scores will have additional points on the


                       recorded activity. The students had a lot of fun while answering the Quizziz. They like

                       the  excitement  and  the  roulette  of  plus points  that  Ms.  Branzuela  used.  It  was an

                       effective strategy to make the students active while reviewing the lessons. We can also

                       observe if they are already prepared to take the recorded activities.




                       Day 22: 17 November 2021

























                                                Discussion of Japanese literature

                              Every week we switch in handling the students. Today, Ms. Vicedo is the one

                       who  had  a  discussion  with  Grade  8.  She  talked  about  Japanese  literature  and  its


                       culture. Grade 8's English literature is about different countries' works and influences.

                       She read a Japanese writer's story while the students attentively listened to the story.

                       To make sure that the students listened, Ms. Vicedo asked a few questions to them.

                       After class, I checked some of Grade 7-Brazil’s activities.]]></page><page Index="157"><![CDATA[23


                       Day 23: 18 November 2021





















                                                        Roulette of points

                              I am preparing my lesson for the next meeting that I will handle the class. I have

                       a lot of activities in mind considering the things that I learned in my last discussions. I

                       wanted to make the class interactive. I observed that they are motivated when there

                       are rewards for the activities that we are doing. Because of that, I will also use the

                       roulette of plus points that Ms. Brazuela used in her discussion. It doesn't just motivate


                       the  students  to  be  more  active  and  energized,  but  it  also  helps  them  to  practice

                       participating in the discussion.



                       Day 24: 19 November 2021

                              We don’t have a class, but I continued working on the class record as well as

                       the  instructional  materials  for  the  next  lesson.  I  wanted  to  try  using  educational

                       technology  tools  such  as  Jamboard,  YouTube  clips,  Quizizz,  and  Google  Form.  I


                       explored the tools of those sites so that I could see if I could really use them with

                       convenience. But then, I realized that some of the students are not able to use some

                       of it because it's new to them. I might waste time explaining how to use those sites, so

                       I  stuck  with  what  they  already  know,  which  is  Quizziz.  I  also  prepared  my  other

                       instructional materials like PowerPoint presentations where they can copy and answer


                       the activities.]]></page><page Index="158"><![CDATA[24


                       Day 25: 22 November 2021




























                                       Grade 8- Finland review for summative examination

                              We  were  surprised  that  it  was  already  the  summative  examination  of  the

                       students.  It is maybe because we are used to the higher education calendar that we

                       didn't notice that we had already finished three weeks of discussing the lessons. Today

                       Grade 8 reviewed the whole lesson 5 that was discussed by Ms. Vicedo and Ms. Diaz.


                       Some students seem confused about general and specific ideas, so this review is a

                       huge help for them to have a clarification for the exam.



                       Day 26: 23 November 2021

























                                        Grade 8- Brazil review for summative examination]]></page><page Index="159"><![CDATA[25


                              Today Ms. Vicedo reviewed the class for their summative examination. I am

                       proud of my students because they can easily answer the questions that Ms. Vicedo

                       asked them. This is one of the emotional prizes that a teacher would get in teaching.

                       The fulfillment of having people learn and understand things that you taught them. I


                       am very fulfilled that the students can remember the things that I discussed with them.

                       I know that it is difficult in this type of setting, but I am still thankful that I get to teach

                       these students.



                       Day 27: 24 November 2021























                                              Finding resources for the next lesson


                              Today  is  the  beginning  of  the  students'  summative  examination.  It  is  an

                       asynchronous exam, so we do not have a class. Now, I am just preparing for my next

                       lessons. While preparing my materials, I am thinking of the students' exams and hoping

                       that they will get a good outcome. Especially the Grade 8 students, because in the

                       class participation, they are not that active, and that's 40% of the grading system. They

                       need to have a good score so that they can go through the quarter.]]></page><page Index="160"><![CDATA[26




                       Day 28: 25 November 2021

                              It is difficult to do a job in a personal situation. My dog died today. Although we

                       don't have a virtual class because it is their summative examination, I still need to


                       complete and check the records of the students. This is one of a teacher's struggles;

                       despite the personal situation that we are facing, we still need to keep things going. I

                       realize that how about those teachers that needed to face the class with a happy face?

                       It must be very difficult, but teachers still stand firm. I am really astounded by how

                       teachers do that kind of strength and professionalism. It's so selfless.




                       Day 29: 26 November 2021

                              The students are taking the exam, that's why we do not have a class today. I

                       finished my lesson plan and instructional materials for the next lesson, so I don't really

                       have much to do today. I realized that some lessons in the book have literature in them.

                       I decided to read some of the literary works of Filipino writers. I read A Footnote to

                       Youth by Jose Garcia Villa. This story is good to tackle in this generation. It is about


                       getting married or having a family at a very young age. Using materials like this would

                       help us, teachers, relate the lesson to the community's current situation. I think that

                       our students will be active in literature this time because they can easily connect the

                       story to the current situation in society. They can share what they know about the issue.]]></page><page Index="161"><![CDATA[27


                       Day 30: 29 November 2021






















                              Today is Grade 8's class, and I almost forgot about it. I was busy assembling

                       my table, and I forgot about the time. I think I was 5 minutes late, so I apologized to

                       Ms. Vicedo and Ms. Diaz through a private message. This is a struggle in the online

                       class, and we must be aware of time because sometimes we get too comfortable in

                       our place. We need to be more responsible on that matter. Ms. Diaz handled the class


                       and talked about claims and counterclaims. The Grade 8 students were quiet as usual.

                       But Ms. Diaz lets them answer questions about the topic. The students are maybe

                       quiet, but they can still answer the questions when asked.



                       Day 31: 30 November 2021


                              I got confused with the date today. I forgot that we do not have a synchronous

                       class.  I  prepared  and  wore  my  uniform,  then  realized  that  I  had  been  waiting  for

                       nothing. Maybe because yesterday, I was late and now I am overthinking that I might

                       attend the class late. Anyway, while I was waiting in my imaginary class, I checked on

                       my instructional materials. Our next topic is grammar, specifically Clause. Grammar

                       could be a difficult topic to discuss, so I took that into consideration while adjusting my

                       materials.]]></page><page Index="162"><![CDATA[28


                       Day 32: 01 December 2021

                              This is the activity day of Grade 8. I experienced a problem with the internet

                       provider because they had system maintenance, so I was not able to attend the class.

                       I talked to my cooperating teacher about the matter, and she allowed me not to attend


                       today.  Ms.  Vicedo  said  that  I  would  just  put  it  in  my  journal  and  do  some  offline

                       paperwork. So, I checked the materials for my next lesson. I prepared my PowerPoint

                       presentation and lesson plan.



                       Day 33: 03 December 2021




























                                                Discussion about personification

                              Since we are switching in handling the class, Ms. Vicedo is the one handling

                       Grade  7  today.  They  were  late  with  their  lesson,  so  Ms.  Vicedo  made  this  day  a

                       discussion on the lesson and finished the activities. It is great that the lesson is easy

                       because it is about personification. Ms. Vicedo used a video presentation about the

                       lesson, but the internet is quite slow, so the video experienced lagging. Nonetheless,


                       the class is good, and the students seem to have fun.]]></page><page Index="163"><![CDATA[29


                       Day 34: 06 December 2021

                              Ms. Vicedo announced that there is no synchronous class today because she

                       is taking care of something in school. Administrative work is part of the job of a teacher.

                       Some people think that teachers have fewer things to do since we are in an online


                       setting. It is a huge misrepresentation because people cannot see our job behind the

                       blackboard. We are doing so much paperwork and meetings. I have been thinking of

                       these things while recording my students' activities. I think that teachers deserve more

                       credit for this type of job.




                       Day 35: 07 December 2021

















                                       Presentation of supplementary video about Clause

                              I didn't like how I performed in class today. I felt like I could do more in order to

                       make the lesson easier to understand. I felt so nervous the first time I handled the

                       class. The reason, I am not sure, may be anxiety. I remembered that before taking this

                       course, I was worried that I might not meet the needs of my students. I hope that I can


                       overcome this anxiety of standing and talk in front of many people. I hate that I stutter

                       and feel so nervous sometimes. Thankfully, I gave my students supplementary videos

                       that  could  help  in  understand  the  lesson  better.  After  class,  I  created  a  teacher's

                       Facebook  account.  I  added  my  students  and  then  posted  the  lessons  and  other

                       instructional materials that could help them in our previous lesson. I am just glad that


                       next meeting, I'll be reviewing them before I give them the activities so I can make sure

                       that they understand them better.]]></page><page Index="164"><![CDATA[30


                       Day 36: 08 December 2021

                              We  don't  have  a  class  again  today  because  it  is  Immaculate  Conception.

                       Despite the holiday, teachers do a lot of things offline. We are handling many students,

                       so  checking  activities  is  not  easy,  especially  when  we  are  in  an  online  setting.  I


                       experienced  different  struggles  in  checking  activities.  Some  students  submit  their

                       works late, and we still need to record them. Some students take pictures of activities

                       blurred or need to be flipped. I realized that we need more than patience in handling

                       classes.




                       Day 37: 09 December 2021


















                                                   Discussion about hyperbole

                              Today, supposedly, we don’t have a class. Since we did not meet the Grade 8


                       for a week, we need to have a class today. Today’s topic is hyperbole. It is a pretty

                       easy  lesson,  but  the  students  are  still  not  as  interactive.  Interaction  between  the

                       teacher and students is very important. It will show whether the students acquired and

                       met the objectives of the lesson. Ms. Vicedo is always giving them the advice to give

                       attention to recitation so that she knows when or how to discuss the lesson better.


                       Feedback from students is a very important thing because we can adjust our teaching

                       strategy through them.]]></page><page Index="165"><![CDATA[31


                       Day 38: 10 December 2021
























                                               Grade 7- Brazil doing their activities


                              I am so glad and happy that I gave the Grade 7 class a good activity today. I

                       can really see that they enjoyed it because they actively participated. Before giving

                       them  the  activities,  I  reviewed  the  class  about  the  lesson's  last  meeting.  I  used  a

                       PowerPoint presentation and Quizziz to make sure they enjoyed it at the same time

                       and  clear  their  confusion  about  it.  As  I  assumed,  the  students  really  like  rewards


                       because it stimulates their attention and competitiveness.  They are so competitive in

                       a good way to get those plus points that I listed. Most importantly, I am satisfied with

                       the outcome of their activities. We can now proceed with a new lesson.



                       Day 39: 13 December 2021





















                                    Grade 8-Finland reviewing for the 2nd quarter examination]]></page><page Index="166"><![CDATA[32




                              Before the Christmas break, students will have their 2nd quarterly examination,

                       so today, the students reviewed all the lessons that we tackled in this quarter. Most of

                       the students were able to answer the review questions that Ms. Vicedo asked. This


                       quarter the examination of the students is going to be easy because the lesson that

                       they tackled is mostly about Figures of Speech and Claims. I expect that they would

                       get higher scores because they have great teachers that really made an effort to make

                       them understand the lessons better.




                       Day 40: 14 December 2021

                              Today, Ms. Vicedo supposedly reviewed Grade 7-Brazil. However, due to an

                       urgent matter in school, she is not able to attend the class.  As a result, she tasked us

                       to do the review so it could help the students recall and clear their confusion with our

                       lessons this quarter. Because of a problem with my device, I was not able to open my

                       microphone. Ms. Kasselle took the class on their review. I provided them with the

                       documents and PowerPoint presentations that they needed. The first lesson that they


                       recall is about the types of Phrases. Ms. Kasselle used an effective way to make it

                       interactive. She made it like a game activity wherein students interact actively.

                              In the same way as the other topic, they were active. It  is so rewarding to

                       observe how they understood all the lessons that we gave them. Students did not just

                       learn, but they could really apply the lessons on a daily basis.]]></page><page Index="167"><![CDATA[33


                       Day 41: 03 January 2022

                              The class hasn't started yet at  New  Generation  International  School.  Other

                       schools,  especially  public  schools,  are  already  on  track  with  their  class  after  the

                       Christmas break. I am somehow glad that we have time to finish the records of the


                       students. That is what I did today. I have students that submitted their works during

                       Christmas vacation, so I need to check those in order to compute their grades for the

                       previous quarter. This is one of the struggles of a teacher in an online class. Since

                       students have longer submission opportunities, they often use them. Then, when the

                       computation  of  grades  is  near,  they'll  submit  their  work  so  late.  But  we  need  to


                       understand that there are students that really need to wait and have patience because

                       their resources may not be as good as the others.



                       Day 42: 04 January 2022

                              Just like yesterday, I made sure that the students submitted their works before

                       the new quarter began. But to do that, I asked them in our group chat if they had free

                       time to do the tasks that they hadn't submitted yet. It is still their vacation, so I am really


                       not urging them, but I just reminded them. In doing that, they will not cram. They can

                       enjoy a lot of their time during their vacation. These are the things that I have learned

                       all throughout my journey as a student. I was wasting my time on unimportant things

                       while thinking about my schoolwork. I cannot fully enjoy my time because of the things

                       that  I  need  to  do.  So,  for  me  to  fully  enjoy  myself,  I  am  always  trying  to  avoid


                       procrastination. I want my students to learn and be able to manage their time right, so

                       they can submit their works on time.]]></page><page Index="168"><![CDATA[34


                       Day 43: 05 January 2022

                              My final demonstration teaching is coming. I must prepare my lesson plan and

                       other instructional materials. My final demo would also be the first day and the first

                       lesson of Grade 7-Brazil in this new quarter and New Year. So, it is in my mind to


                       connect my activities with their New Year vacation. I already knew that my lesson

                       would be grammar, specifically about writing an Essay.  I looked again into the book,

                       so I would know the additional information that I needed to get from the internet. This

                       lesson is the type in which my students do not want to participate in. Many of them

                       don't want to write long paragraphs, so it will be a challenge, especially since it will be


                       my final demo. I also take note to prevent using the term "Christmas vacation" because

                       some students might not be celebrating one. I read an article that teachers must be

                       sensitive to these celebrations and norms. These are the things that I considered to

                       formulate my objectives.



                       Day 44: 06 January 2022

                              As I prepare for the upcoming demonstration teaching, I am starting to realize


                       that the end of our internship is near. Despite being in an online setting, we built a

                       connection and good teacher-student relationship with the Grade 7-Brazil. At first, they

                       were too shy to communicate with us. It was a challenge how to get to know them and

                       become familiar with their faces because we sometimes do not open their cameras.

                       But after some interactive games, we got to see their differences. Since they are just


                       in the 7th Grade, we can observe their playfulness and child-like personalities. There

                       are also students that are quiet but talented in different aspects. I already miss them

                       just thinking about the end of our internship. These students that we handled made us

                       learn things that we haven't in our journey as education students. I hope that they also

                       learned a lot from us, as much as how we learned from them.]]></page><page Index="169"><![CDATA[35


                       Day 45: 07 January 2022

                              Yesterday, I finished preparing my lesson plan and instructional materials for

                       the final demonstration teaching. I just need to brief the students on what is going to

                       happen on Tuesday. It is our first class discussion this quarter, and after their vacation,


                       so they might get confused about the panels that will observe the class. As I greeted

                       the students with a happy new year on their group chat, they already responded with

                       the highest energy. I informed them about my demonstration teaching and asked for a

                       favor to be as active, just like when we are in a normal class. Because that is what I

                       prepared  with  my  instructional  materials,  I  wanted  to  make  it  like  a  normal  day of


                       discussion so that my students could understand the lesson without thinking of the

                       event. Even though it is a significant day, my first priority is my students' learning

                       outcomes. I brief the Grade 7 students, and I feel like they are also nervous. Because

                       of that, I made sure that it was clear to them that it was just like a normal day where

                       we would enjoy learning a new lesson.



                       Day 46: 10 January 2022


                              Monday  is  the  official  start  of  the  new  quarter  after  the  vacation  at  New

                       Generation International School. It is also the final demonstration of Ms. Diaz, so we

                       cannot  enter  the  class  of  Grade  8.  To  make  this  day  productive,  I  checked  and

                       prepared the follow-up activities that I will give to the Grade 7 students after I discuss

                       the lesson on Tuesday. This activity is going to be in Google Form. My students like to


                       use this kind of platform because they don't need to write it down in their notebooks.

                       Before, I observed that Ms. Vicedo made them write the activities so that they would

                       have their reviewer when the examination came. However, I think it would be time-

                       consuming  given  that  the  students  are  writing  slowly.  I  will  just  give  them

                       supplementary videos, written reports, and PowerPoint presentations so that they can

                       review those files.]]></page><page Index="170"><![CDATA[36


                       Day 47: 11 January 2022
























                                                  Final demonstration teaching


                              Today is my final teaching demonstration. I am prepared, but I can't deny how

                       nervous I was even before the class began. The first thing that I did today was to check

                       my instructional materials. Although I finalized and checked it yesterday, I still wanted

                       to make sure, so we can prevent some technical difficulties. It is the most common

                       problem in this setting. We cannot control the circumstances that may happen in the

                       online classroom, like the slow internet connection. However, the chances of having

                       these issues can be prevented if we are prepared. After that, I sent the link to the


                       Google meet in the group chat of Grade 7-Brazil, earlier than the usual time. I also

                       entered the link so I could present my instructional materials before they entered the

                       room. Some of the students attended earlier than I expected. They wanted to have the

                       free time to bond with each other. So, they were talking and teasing. They also asked

                       about some details about the demonstration teaching, so I took the time to answer

                       those questions. I liked that we were talking. It made me forget the tension that I was


                       feeling for the demo teaching.

                              I waited for the panels to enter the link, and the time had come to start the class.

                       I started with the greetings. It is our first English class in the 2nd quarter and this new

                       year. I did not want the class to feel too much pressure, so I asked them how their

                       vacation was, and some of them were able to share their experience. After that were]]></page><page Index="171"><![CDATA[37


                       the classroom reminders and attendance, I am glad that the class is complete on the

                       first day of this quarter. I forgot to press the record button not until the screenshot for

                       attendance. I asked permission to record the screen before I actually did the recording.

                       Then, to connect the current situation, I prepared a motivational activity that students


                       can easily share their new year. The activity is quite easy, and they are just going to

                       list down their top 3 new year's resolutions. These are the things they want to change

                       or things they want to achieve this year. It is like a goal to guide them in this new

                       endeavor in life. I gave them time to think of those things and let some of the students

                       volunteer to share their answers. I observed that my students became reluctant to


                       answer. Most of the time, Grade 7-Brazil is an active class. I think that they were just

                       nervous with the panelist that was observing. In that case, I called some students to

                       answer.  I  always  give  commendations  and  rewards  to  my  students  when  they

                       participate in class discussions. It helps them to boost their confidence to talk in front

                       of the class. I also made sure that it would look and feel like we were just on a normal

                       day.  I  let  them  share  their  stories  and  why  they  want  that  resolution.  After  the

                       motivation, I introduced our new topic of writing an Essay.


                              For  the  past  weeks,  we  have  been  discussing  phrases,  clauses,  and

                       sentences. Now, we are in the larger part of grammar: writing an essay. I asked the

                       class if they had any ideas about essays. Some of them have knowledge about it, and

                       some  are  still  confused.  I  discussed  the  lesson  afterward.  I  wanted  to  have  an

                       interactive class despite my students being shy. I always ask questions and make them


                       repeat the information that I just gave them. Repeating the information is letting me

                       know whether they have understood the lesson or not. Especially when I discuss the

                       3 Parts of an Essay, I always repeat each part so that my students would retain it. I

                       have observed that students are confused whenever we teach something that has a

                       lot of subtopics. They always mix up those subtopics and end up making mistakes in

                       their activities. So, these techniques would help them have a clear mind of the three]]></page><page Index="172"><![CDATA[38


                       parts of the essay. I also provided an example in the last part of the discussion so that

                       they can see the structure when it is combined.

                              Then we went on with the activities. I already introduced the Padlet to Grade

                       7-Brazil since our first meeting, so I used it in my final demonstration as well. The


                       activity is simple; they will just write an essay and then post it on Padlet. I still connected

                       the theme of the essay with their new year's resolution so it would be easier for them

                       to write or narrate something. Padlet is such a good tool to submit students' works.

                       They can design and customize the post with the features of the site. They seem to

                       enjoy working because they are focused on the activity. After that, some of the students


                       message me that they have a slow internet connection; I allow them to pass their works

                       on messenger and after class. The assessment that I prepared is pretty simple, and it

                       is in Google Form. I know that we have limited time, so it is just a short assessment. I

                       also presented the question in my PowerPoint presentation so that those students who

                       are not able to open the link can answer in their notebooks and send it to me via

                       messenger or email.

                              I  ended  the  class  by  giving  them  an  assignment.  I  am  glad  that  the


                       demonstration teaching went well. After class, the panel gave me their comments, and

                       I am so grateful for them to point out the things that I need to improve. I am also fulfilled

                       and relieved by their comments. I will make sure to use those learnings to improve

                       myself as an educator.]]></page><page Index="173"><![CDATA[39


                       Day 48: 12 January 2022

                              We are not able to enter the Grade 8 class today. Because of that, I made

                       myself busy with some paperwork. I wanted to check the activities that I gave to my

                       students yesterday. However, now that I have just finished my final demonstration


                       teaching, my mind is still floating in the air. I did not know how I overcame my anxiety

                       whenever other teachers watched me.  In my previous entry in this journal, I mentioned

                       that I still have anxiety in front of a crowd despite the program that I am in. Thankfully,

                       I felt relieved when my students were cooperating with me, although some were really

                       shy. After some thought, I continued checking the activities and assignments of those


                       students that submitted their work.



                       Day 49: 13 January 2022

                              It  is  Thursday,  and  we  don't  have  a  class.  I  am  quite  busy  checking  the

                       remaining activities of the students. Some students are not good at managing their

                       time in an online setting. As long as the due date of the activity is yet to come, the

                       students will not submit it. For that reason, teachers tend to check the activities every


                       day until all of them have completed their work. It is really difficult to push the students

                       because some of them are really having difficulties adjusting to this type of setting. But

                       as their teachers, we've been reminding them how important time management is.

                       School is their practice field before they go to their real endeavor in life. It will be an

                       edge to have this character. Nonetheless, when they submit their works, I am still


                       grateful and satisfied with the outputs.]]></page><page Index="174"><![CDATA[40


                       Day 50: 14 January 2022

                              We don’t have a class because we are still waiting on Ms. Branzuela's final

                       demonstration teaching. Today, I checked the activities of the remaining students.  I

                       am  really  glad  that  I  am  handling  these  students  and  we  are  in  this  school.  My


                       cooperating teacher is very kind and approachable. Our students are so great because

                       they respect us as their teachers despite the short age gap. Today I felt glad that the

                       Grade 7 students had fulfilled the required activities that I presented. I have thoughts

                       in my mind while checking the activities. The Grade 7- Brazil is a section that will not

                       fail you with their works, and I really appreciate it. They are making sure that it is not


                       just mediocre work but the best product that they can submit. As their teacher, I am

                       very proud of them.



                       Day 51: 17 January 2022

                              We are all finished with our final demonstration, and we don't have a class

                       today.  It  is  supposedly  the  discussion  day  of  the  Grade  8  class;  however,  our

                       cooperating teacher is quite busy with the administrative work, so we need to continue


                       our meeting on Wednesday. Ms. Vicedo also asked if we could give her a copy of the

                       students' records last time, so today, I need to finish checking the works of Grade 7-

                       Brazil. The activity that I am checking is about writing an essay. I made the students

                       write their new year's resolutions. These are the things that they wanted to change for

                       their betterment. Most of them wanted to have better grades in class to make their


                       family proud. One student wrote that he doesn't want to make his mother cry, so he

                       will study hard this year. I am fascinated that they are thinking about these things at a

                       very young age. It is not an obligation, but they think of giving back to their parents. I

                       am so proud of this class.]]></page><page Index="175"><![CDATA[41


                       Day 52: 18 January 2022

                              Today, the class enjoyed the activity that Ms. Branzuela prepared, and they

                       played a game called Who Wants to Be a Millionaire. It is like a review of the previous

                       lessons if the students can still remember those important details. The class had fun


                       because of the virtual money points in the game. They've been joking that the million

                       in  the  games  are  real,  which  made  them  more  active.  The  activity  helped  them

                       stimulate class participation even in the discussion. The lesson is under literature. Most

                       of  the  students  are  not  active  when  it  is  too  long  passages.  But  with  the  help  of

                       motivational activity, the students are more inclined. The lesson is specifically about


                       Drama. So, there are elements of drama that students can act out. They are given a

                       short dialogue, and they have to read it in class. Some of them are shy, but the class

                       ended with so much fun and learning.



                       Day 53: 19 January 2022




















                                                Discussion about advertisements

                              Ms. Diaz is finished with all of her lessons with the Grade 8, so their class is


                       now back to Ms. Vicedo. We are just sitting in because we still need to fill the hours in

                       our daily time record. Today, the lesson was about advertisements. They tackled the

                       different types of advertising in the market. They are hitting two birds here because it

                       is also connected with the use of Figures of Speech. Teachers can really be creative

                       in this kind of situation. How will you connect two lessons in one discussion? Ms.]]></page><page Index="176"><![CDATA[42


                       Vicedo is really good at doing that. She also creates classroom scenarios wherein

                       students can answer questions regarding the topic. I have read that if we use this

                       approach, students can retain the lesson that we are teaching. They are engaged when

                       the content is directly related to them. I will also use this approach when I handle my


                       own class.



                       Day 54: 20 January 2022

                              Today I really enjoyed creating my Instructional Materials. I discovered a lot of

                       new interactive sites that my students can enjoy. I saw a video tutorial on YouTube


                       about interactive sites and found Bamboozle's website. It offers game-based online

                       learning in an easy-to-use environment for teams. It stands out in all the websites that

                       I  saw because  it  is a  very easy-to-use platform  that  works well  across  even  older

                       devices, making it very accessible. We can take a quiz in class as a group, share it for

                       online lessons, or set one as an individual task. It's a flexible platform if you are a

                       teacher. I saw that it offers a lot of games, and it also lets you create one.




                       Day 55: 21 January 2022

                              Ms.  Branzuela  handled  the  class;  she  recalled  the  previous  lesson  before

                       giving  the  actual  activities.  In  the  review,  they  used  an  application  that  draws  the

                       names  of  the  students.  This  application  is  an  effective  way  to  know  whether  the

                       students understood the lesson or not. Since it is random picking, they will prepare


                       themselves to answer the questions. The students were thrilled with the activity. They

                       were surprised and excited because of the additional points that they would get if they

                       got the answers right. It is so fun to have activities in this section because the students

                       are so competitive in a good way. Especially in team activities, it is usually girls vs.

                       boys, and they really want to win each game. The hardship in creating activities is

                       worth it when you see your students enjoy it.]]></page><page Index="177"><![CDATA[43


                       Day 56: 24 January 2022



























                                      Grade 8- Finland reviewing before taking the activities

                              It  is  a  hot  sunny  day.  Since  Ms.  Lovely  discussed  the  lesson  about


                       Advertisement last meeting, Grade 8 is having their activities today, even if it's Monday.

                       Upon entering the meeting, Ms. Lovely and the Grade 8 students have been reviewing

                       their activity. The Grade 8 is quiet, as usual; they don't answer the question if they are

                       not called. Ms. Lovely is struggling with the humidity, and I guess the Grade 8 as well.

                       There are a lot of factors why students can be quiet and lazy, and one reason could


                       be the hot weather and the time of their class in the afternoon. So, Ms. Lovely started

                       the activity right away after the short review so that they could finish it earlier than the

                       usual time. After the class, Ms. Diaz bid her farewell to her students. I think that Ms.

                       Diaz and the Grade 8 match their personality. Ms. Diaz knew how to handle the class

                       because she is also a shy type of person as a student. Because of that, she and her

                       students had a connection. They are not vocal, but the students are sweet with their

                       messages in private. We took a picture, and this is the last day with this grade level.]]></page><page Index="178"><![CDATA[44


                       Day 57: 25 January 2022























                                             Last discussion day with Grade 7- Brazil

                              It is the last lesson I'll discuss in this class. I prepared so much that they won't


                       easily  forget  us  despite  the  short  time  of  teaching  them.  I  want  them  to  instill  the

                       lessons that we gave them. With that, I tried using more interactive activities. I used

                       Baamboozle today, and it is a team game where the representatives of each team will

                       pick a number that has a hidden question. This game made them active and answered

                       the questions from the previous lessons because I rewarded them with points. The


                       students started to express themselves when we mentioned that it would be our last

                       week of handling them. I started getting messages privately, and it really melted my

                       heart. It is really fulfilling to have these students learn many things.]]></page><page Index="179"><![CDATA[45


                       Day 58: 26 January 2022

                              Our class with Grade 8 has ended, so we don't have a class to attend today.

                       However, there are Grade 7 students that are still incomplete in my record. Even in our

                       first activities, some students really need to be reminded so they know that they have


                       a gap in their grades. I wanted to complete this record so that when Ms. Vicedo needs

                       it,  she  will  not have  a hard  time  filling  those  missing outputs.  So,  I  messaged  the

                       students to remind them of their outputs.  Some of them can submit, but there are still

                       students that cannot. They have reasons, and I considered them. But I also advise

                       them to finish it so that they will not force themselves on outputs at the end of the


                       quarter.



                       Day 59: 27 January 2022

                              Tomorrow will  be  the  activity  day  of  Grade  7.  It  is  also  the  last  day of  our

                       internship journey. Because of that, I want the day to be more special and different. I

                       thought of things that might give them a memorable experience in learning English with

                       us. I prepared a game using Quiizziz. It is a simple multiple-choice for the review and


                       motivation activity of the students. I remember that they really like that site because of

                       the ranking of points on each question. I think that this site will energize the students,

                       even though they already know how it works.  I also used the advice of our panelists

                       in my final demonstration. I will use a more energetic voice when I am teaching so the

                       class will also get it. In creating instructional materials, I became more mindful of the


                       sizes of the fonts and the rule of 6. I know that I need to learn and practice more to be

                       a better educator. So, I will always find room for improvement for myself and for my

                       students.]]></page><page Index="180"><![CDATA[46




                       Day 60: 28 January 2022

























                                                  Last day with Grade 7- Brazil

                              Today, I am preparing myself to hold back my emotions. This is the last day of

                       our teaching internship, and I am already missing my students. Before the class starts,

                       some students are already kidding that  we shouldn't leave them. They want us to

                       extend our stay because we have been bonding in the class while discussing and even


                       in the group chat; they are so fun to talk to.

                              I am sad, but I am also excited to start the class. Just like before, I reviewed

                       the class using the Quizziz. I already noticed that some of them are busy doing another

                       thing, they said that it is for the other subjects. I allow them to do it because the first

                       activity that I gave them is not yet recorded. Regardless of what they were doing, the


                       class still got high scores, so I am really glad that they understood the lesson. Then, I

                       gave them the real activity and made them set aside the things that they were doing.

                       It is just short activity, and I'll be the one to check it. After all of today's agenda, I

                       presented a collage picture of our online classes with the note "Thank you, Grade 7-

                       Brazil". I started to say my last message to my students. Most of them interrupt me by

                       saying that we must stay. The Grade 7 students are shy but the sweetest. I made my

                       message short by giving them life advice. I can't make it too long because I am just


                       holding back my tears as I bid our message as their teacher.]]></page><page Index="181"><![CDATA[47


                              They gave us the warmest farewell. After the class, students started to send

                       long  messages.  Then,  Ms.  Vicedo  thanked  us  and  sent  a  video  of  students

                       congratulating us and saying their goodbyes to us. My heart is so full. Even though we

                       are in an online class, we made a good teacher-student connection. I am thankful and


                       glad that I handled these students and to be handled by Ms. Vicedo.]]></page><page Index="182"><![CDATA[48


                                              COMMON CLASSROOM PROBLEM




                              There will always be difficult circumstances in the classroom, even when we

                       prepare things in their order. Especially in an online setting, an online classroom can

                       be flexible and accessible, but we cannot prevent encountering serious challenges

                       while we are in class.

                              The most common classroom problem is something that is inevitable in an


                       online  setting,  the  internet  connection.  It  can  have  different  issues  in  the  most

                       unexpected times. In this academic year, the students are required to have an internet

                       connection to attend and submit their work. There are times that some students are

                       not able to comply with their activities, so we are giving them a long time to submit. It

                       encompasses more problems when it occurs. It would also be difficult to display and

                       execute instructional activities that require an internet connection. The free websites


                       offer interactive activities; it only requires an internet connection. Another common

                       problem would be technical difficulties. We are all new to this setting, and we are all

                       adjusting to the new ways how to perform in our class. For us to have a good flow of

                       discussion, we must have media and technology literacy. Our students are so updated

                       with  the  latest updates on  the  web  and  technology.  As  their  teacher,  sometimes  I

                       cannot keep up, so we cannot walk on the same path of conversation. Thus, we must

                       also learn these sites to keep up with our students. In an online setting, it is also difficult


                       to  maintain  classroom  management.  Students  are  easily  distracted  by  their

                       environment,  the  internet,  and  their  devices.  There  are  times  when  we  cannot

                       communicate well because of these barriers. Especially when the student's camera is

                       turned off, they are usually shy to answer and/or not motivated with this setting.

                              As their teacher, it is important to support and guide my students in this new


                       setting. I always remind them that despite our situation, it must not hinder us from

                       learning.  Building  rapport  with  students  is  an  essential  thing.  If  you  have  a  good

                       relationship with them, all these classroom problems are easily resolved.]]></page><page Index="183"><![CDATA[49


                                             FINAL DEMONSTRATION TEACHING




                              The  first  preparation  that  I  did  was  my  lesson  plan  and  other  instructional

                       materials. Since my final demonstration would be the first day and the first lesson of

                       Grade 7-Brazil, I've already planned my activities to coincide with their New Year's

                       vacation. I was also aware that my course would focus on grammar, specifically how

                       to write an essay. I re-read the book to see what additional information I would need


                       to obtain from the internet. This is the type of lesson in which my students do not want

                       to participate. Many of them do not like writing long paragraphs, so it will be difficult,

                       especially since it will be my final demonstration. I also avoid using the term "Christmas

                       vacation"  because  some  students  may  not  celebrate  it  due  to  religious  beliefs.

                       Because we have a diverse class, I read that teachers must be sensitive to these

                       celebrations  and  norms.  These  are  the  factors  I  considered  when  developing  my


                       objectives. I wanted to make my lesson timely, interactive, and sensitive so that every

                       student could relate while learning.

                              For my instructional materials, I prepared a PowerPoint presentation as my

                       visuals. PowerPoint presentation is an effective tool to use in this type of setting. It is

                       easy to use and navigate. We can insert figures, shapes, pictures, and videos that can

                       help in the discussion of the lesson.  Google provides beautiful templates that we can

                       download for free. So, the visual that I used was inspired by one of those templates. I


                       made  sure  that  the  figures  and  letters  in  my  visuals  were  readable  enough  when

                       presented in the Google meet. I also used videos and clips. In the prayer, instead of

                       calling a student to pray, I inserted a short video prayer. This prevents teachers from

                       calling students that might not have the same belief as to the majority. In the activities,

                       I also inserted video clips of timers. It is to ensure that my students are aware of the


                       given time to finish their work.

                              I am prepared for my actual final demonstration teaching, but I can't deny how

                       nervous I was even before the class started. The first thing I did this morning went over]]></page><page Index="184"><![CDATA[50


                       my instructional materials. Despite the fact that I had already finalized and checked it

                       several times, I wanted to be certain so that we could avoid any technical difficulties.

                       It  is  the  most  common  issue  in  this  situation.  We  have  no  control  over  the

                       circumstances  that  may  occur  in  the  online  classroom,  such  as  a  slow  internet


                       connection. However, if we are prepared, we can reduce the likelihood of having these

                       issues. After that, I sent the link to the Google meet in the group chat of Grade 7-Brazil,

                       earlier than the usual time. I also entered the link so I could present my instructional

                       materials before they entered the room. Some of the students attended earlier than I

                       expected. They wanted to have the free time to bond with each other. So, they were


                       talking  and  teasing.  They  also  asked  about  some  details  about  the  demonstration

                       teaching, so I took the time to answer those questions. I liked that we were talking; it

                       made me forget the tension that I was feeling for the demo teaching.

                              I waited for the panels to enter the link, and it was finally time to begin the class.

                       I began by greeting everyone. This is our first English class of the second quarter and

                       the new school year. I didn't want the class to feel rushed, so I asked how their vacation

                       went, and some of them were able to share their experiences. After that, there were


                       classroom reminders and attendance, and I am relieved that the class was complete

                       on  the  first  day  of  the  quarter.  I  forgot  to  press  the  record  button  until  I  took  the

                       attendance screenshot. Before I began recording the screen, I requested permission

                       to do so. The activity is quite easy, and they are just going to list down their top 3 new

                       year's resolutions. These are the things that they want to change or things that they


                       want to achieve this year. It is like a goal to guide them in this new endeavor in life. I

                       gave them time to think of those things and let some of the students volunteer to share

                       their answers. I observed that my students became reluctant to answer. Most of the

                       time,  Grade  7-Brazil  is  an  active  class;  I  think  that  they  are  just  nervous  with  the

                       panelist that was observing. In that case, I called some students to answer. I always

                       give  commendations  and  rewards  to  my  students  when  they  participate  in  class

                       discussions. It helps them to boost their confidence to talk in front of the class. I also]]></page><page Index="185"><![CDATA[51


                       made sure that it would look and feels like we were just on a normal day. I let them

                       share their stories and why they want that resolution. After the motivation, I introduced

                       our new topic of writing an Essay.

                              We've  been  discussing  phrases,  clauses,  and  sentences  for  the  past  few


                       weeks. Now we're getting into the meat of grammar, which is writing an essay. I asked

                       the students if they had any ideas for essays. Some of them are aware of it, while

                       others are confused. After that, I discussed the lesson. Despite my students' social

                       awkwardness, I wanted to have an interactive class. I always ask questions and make

                       them repeat what I just told them. Repeating the information indicates whether or not


                       they comprehended the lesson. Especially when I discuss the 3 Parts of an Essay, I

                       always repeat each part so that it would be retained by my students. I have observed

                       that students are confused whenever we teach something that has a lot of subtopics.

                       They always mix up those subtopics and end up making mistakes in their activities.

                       So, these techniques would help them have a clear mind of the three parts of the essay.

                       I also provided an example in the last part of the discussion so that they can see the

                       structure when it is combined.


                              Then we resumed our activities. I had already introduced the Padlet to Grade

                       7-Brazil during our first meeting, so I used it again for my final demonstration. The

                       activity is straightforward; they will simply write an essay and post it on Padlet. I still

                       linked the essay's theme to their new year's resolution to make it easier for them to

                       write or narrate something. Padlet is an excellent tool for submitting student work. They


                       can design and customize the post based on the site's features. They appeared to

                       enjoy working because they were focused on the task at hand. Following that, some

                       of the students messaged me to say that their internet connection was slow. I allow

                       them to pass their work on messenger and after class. The assessment that I prepared

                       is pretty simple; it is in Google Form. I know that we have limited time, so it is just a

                       short assessment. I also presented the question in my PowerPoint presentation so that

                       those students who are not able to open the link can answer in their notebooks and]]></page><page Index="186"><![CDATA[52


                       send it to me via messenger or email. I ended the class by giving them an assignment.

                       I am glad that the demonstration teaching went well.

                              After  class,  I  just  waited  for  my  students  to  leave,  so  I  could  let  go  of  my

                       emotions. I felt relieved and a little nervous for the next part of the day. I greeted my


                       panelist as a signal that my class had ended. The panel gave me their comments on

                       the observation. My panel was Ms. Estrelita Villa, Ms.  Ivory Mojica, Mx. Audreyson

                       Borilla,  and  my  cooperating  teacher,  Ms.  Lovely  Wendy  A.  Vicedo.  The  post-

                       convention started with Ms. Villa. She greeted me and asked how I felt; I told her how

                       nervous and relieving it felt when you are done with the final demonstration phase. I


                       actually had anxiety during the first part of the discussion, so there are times that I

                       stutter. But as the discussion went on, it adjusted, and I became comfortable. The

                       panel  also  observed  that  there  were  students  that  are  not  participating  in  the

                       discussion. I should be more aware of them because they might not understand the

                       words or terms that I am saying. I also need to state more examples in my lesson so

                       that my students can clearly comprehend our lesson.

                              The  panelist  also  commended  me  on  the  strengths  of  my  demonstration


                       teaching. They mentioned that they liked that I talked and asked my students how their

                       vacation was and connected it to the lesson that we were about to discuss. It was my

                       plan to connect my lesson to the current situation of my students to make it timely and

                       relevant to them. I am glad that the panel noticed it. They also said that it made me

                       have a good approach to my students. I do not look like a superior type of teacher; that


                       is why the students can communicate well. It is vital that the students are not afraid of

                       their teacher. That way, they are also not going to be afraid to commit mistakes in

                       recitations.  Respect  is  important,  but  superiority  is  different.  Consequently,  the

                       students are encouraged to participate in class. Some of my students are really shy

                       and do not like to construct long sentences. It became a challenge for me to make

                       them enjoy learning. So, if there are no students that do not want to answer, I am

                       calling them instead. Because of the encouragement to answer, their nervousness was]]></page><page Index="187"><![CDATA[53


                       lessened. Another thing that I was also commended was the instructional materials

                       that I used. Ms. Mojica and Mx. Borilla said that they are already expecting that my

                       visuals would be great. It was nice and suitable for the lesson that I prepared. Ms.

                       Vicedo mentioned that she was nervous when my topic was about essays because


                       Grade  7-Brazil  does  not  like  this  kind  of  topic.  However,  she  was  relieved  that  I

                       prepared new activities every time that we had a meeting. She said that I have been

                       preparing a new dish for every new lesson, so she is so glad that these activities made

                       the students participate in class.

                              After  the  post-conference,  I  was  congratulated  on  the  success  of  my  final


                       demonstration teaching.  I thanked the panel for all their commendations, and I am so

                       grateful for them to point out the things that I need to improve. I will make sure to use

                       those learnings to improve myself as an educator. They sent me good luck for the

                       remaining weeks of my internship. Then, the meeting ended with the certificate of

                       commendation given to Ms. Vicedo for accommodating and teaching us to be better

                       educators.]]></page><page Index="188"><![CDATA[54


                                       OVERALL REFLECTION AND SELF-APPRAISAL




                              I can say that there has been significant growth and improvement in me after

                       the teaching internship at New Generation International School. I have learned a lot

                       about  communication  and  teaching  skills,  workplace  adaptation,  creating  new  and

                       innovative  materials,  and  improving  my  personality,  as  well  as  how  to  create  a

                       harmonious relationship with my students and cooperating teachers. I am glad that,


                       despite the pandemic, I was able to gain a lot of experience as an actual teacher at

                       the institution.

                              I  remember  that  the  very  first  time  I  handled  a  class,  I  felt  so  excited  and

                       nervous at the same time. The feeling of finally having the opportunity to handle actual

                       students after years of studying in the program is overwhelming. It was nerve-wracking

                       because I had anxiety over crowds. However, I also wanted to give the best to my


                       students. So, I practiced a lot before the day of the discussion. I almost memorize

                       every line in every slide of my presentation just to make sure I don't show mistakes. I

                       had doubts about my abilities and skills ever since I chose this program, not until I

                       handled my students. My students played a huge role in making it so easy for me to

                       adjust. I am ecstatic about how they interact with me. They are very active, and it is a

                       lot of fun to talk to them before we even start the lesson. It was like I was talking to my

                       friends, except that I could still feel how students respected me as their teacher. Even


                       when I began to discuss the subject, the students listened intently. I know this because

                       they raised questions and answered questions that I asked them. I did not realize how

                       my anxiety hinders the things that I can give and things that I can learn. Because after

                       getting  comfortable  in  class,  that  was  the  time  when  I  could  fully  observe  and

                       understand the learnings that I could get in this internship. It's incredibly rewarding to


                       have real students listening to and enjoying what you've prepared. We used to have

                       demonstration teaching without students. I was just speaking to my fictitious students.

                       I couldn't see how I was in the actual class, so I didn't know which part I needed to]]></page><page Index="189"><![CDATA[55


                       correct. Now I can assess whether or not I am an effective teacher to my students in

                       this teaching internship.

                              This is not what I expected when I was in the beginning years of the program.

                       I am expecting to stand in front of a four-cornered room filled with students actively


                       listening to my discussion. It is so different because most of the things that we practiced

                       on campus are based on face-to-face classes. In the classroom management before,

                       you can see your students, their body language, and gestures. We can also control

                       the  inside  of  the  classroom  environment  easier.  This  setting  was  a  challenge,

                       especially in managing the classroom, but I learned to adjust. I learned ways how to


                       keep my students focused, organized, and attentive despite being in an online class. I

                       started  each  day  with  the  use  of  creative  visuals  and  motivational  activities.

                       Sometimes,  Ms.  Vicedo  forgets  to  give  motivational  activities,  and  she  starts  the

                       discussion of the lesson right away. Because of that, students tend to get sleepy and

                       bored throughout the class. Thus, I always make sure to make my students' interests

                       grow  in  every  lesson.  I  used  new  and  interactive  sites  online.  We  usually  found

                       ourselves  laughing,  especially  in  team  activities.  I  realized  that  the  students  are


                       competitive in teams. Because of that, even if it is so difficult to create those activities

                       in this setting, I researched a lot to formulate lesson plans and make those activities

                       happen. It was all worth it because the students enjoyed the whole English class.

                              If  it  was  difficult  to  manage  the  class  and  formulate  lesson  plans,  it  is  the

                       opposite when it comes to creating other instructional materials. Since it was an online


                       setting,  we  also  created  materials  on  the  web.  At  first,  I  only  knew  PowerPoint

                       presentations and Quizzis. But now, from researching and watching YouTube vlogs, I

                       have learned to manipulate various websites that offer free tools for the class. My

                       favorite website is Padlet and Bamboozle. They are so easy to use, and the students

                       had so much fun using them. If we were in the traditional setting, we could do more

                       materials. But I'm also relieved because instructional materials can be costly and time-

                       consuming. It entails sleepless nights because we use our hands to produce creative]]></page><page Index="190"><![CDATA[56


                       crafts.  Now,  I  learned  how  to  manage  my  time  effectively  while  working  online.

                       Because of the convenience of using websites, I am able to complete other duties such

                       as checking my students' outputs and some paperwork.

                              I have also learned how to put my knowledge and skills into practice. I observed


                       that sometimes teachers use traditional teaching in the class. Ms. Vicedo uses the

                       Direct Method, in which she instructs students directly. She makes the students repeat

                       the information to ensure that they are paying attention. It became a good opportunity

                       for me to show the students new teaching techniques that they can learn and enjoy at

                       the same time. I always let my students speak in the class about a certain topic. I love


                       to connect the lessons with experience so that students are not afraid to talk in front. I

                       also use what I have mentioned earlier, the games and activities, to make the class

                       more interactive. When I was in the program's early years, we discussed how much

                       Generation Z loves technology. So, I always incorporate new technological tools into

                       the class. Because of these strategies, I did not just provide better education to my

                       students, and I also built a harmonious relationship with them. I appreciated how much

                       excitement they showed when it was already English class. Before, some entered the


                       room with a turned-off microphone and camera. After some meetings, they became

                       more open to us. It is fulfilling when students can freely talk in the class, especially the

                       quiet ones. The students even wanted to see us in person; however, the situation did

                       not permit us.

                              I was struck by how much I had progressed over time regarding the lesson


                       discussion. I stuttered a lot when I first started teaching because I was so nervous. It

                       was so difficult because I always spent so much energy attempting to speak clearly in

                       discussions.  I  was  also unaware  of  my grammatical  errors and  some proper  word

                       usage. It was one of the panelists' comments on my final demonstration teaching. It

                       was initially embarrassing for me as an English major, but I realized that it was not

                       helping me improve. All I can do is practice and concentrate on my growth. Practice is

                       extremely beneficial, as it improved my speaking skills after a few meetings. It was]]></page><page Index="191"><![CDATA[57


                       ironic because I believe I performed better in a regular class than I did in my final

                       demonstration  teaching.  Nonetheless,  I  have  room  for  improvement,  and  the  most

                       important factor for me is how much students can learn. I am better now because of

                       the support and guidance of my cooperating teacher.


                              In this teaching internship journey, I especially liked how I got to work with my

                       cooperating teacher and co-practice teachers.  I was exposed to different kinds of

                       teaching styles. My cooperating handled three interns. Because of that, we are able to

                       observe many English classes. I get to compare the distinctions of each class because

                       they have different ways of handling them. I have been mentioning that Ms. Vicedo


                       has a traditional approach. My co-practice teachers have the opposite. Despite being

                       a student, I also learned from them. Especially in handling Grade 8 students, it was

                       difficult to make the class speak. No one really interacted with the teacher, but Ms.

                       Diaz became firm with her rules. I also implemented that to my students when I handled

                       classes. Rules can make the class aware of things they are required to do. It was

                       effective; I will also use that in my future endeavors as an educator.

                              Suppose I could evaluate and compare myself from the very beginning to now.


                       I can say that I have improved a lot. This progress entails a lot of people, including my

                       professors,  instructors,  co-practice  teachers,  my  cooperating  teacher,  and  my

                       students. I had doubts about myself, and these people helped me to uplift myself.

                       Because of them, I overcame my fear and weaknesses. I still may lack other things,

                       but  it  symbolizes  how  I  wanted  to  learn  more.  I  am  looking  forward  to  more


                       opportunities to broaden my skill set to become an excellent teacher.]]></page><page Index="192"><![CDATA[58

                                               special significance.

                                                          ●  It sets the mood of the essay and provides the
                                                            main point.

                                                 Example of an Essay:
                                                       Online education is an amenable instructional delivery
                                                 process that includes any learning that takes place via the
                                                 internet. Online learning enables educators to communicate
                                                 with students who may not be capable of going in a traditional
                                                 classroom and assists students who need to work on their
                                                 own schedule and at their own speed.
                                                       Online  education  is  known  to  offer  the  benefit  of
                                                 synergy.  The  format  employed  makes  room  for  dynamic
                                                 communications  between  students  and  the  teachers.  With
                                                 online classes, we don’t need to travel to a different city or
                                                 commute long distances. We can stay where we are and keep
                                                 our current job while we work toward improving our career
                                                 with an online degree. Moreover, whether we are a full-time
                                                 or part-time online student, the online education experience
                                                 provides a much more manageable schedule. These unique
                                                 advantages  manifested  a  student-centred  virtual  learning
                                                 environment  that  online  learning  format  alone  can  strongly
                                                 contribute.
                                                       Online  education’s  potential  advantages  involve
                                                 increased  educational  access;  it  provides  a  high-quality
                                                 learning opportunity, improves student outcomes and skills,
                                                 and expands educational choice options. Therefore, location,
                                                 time, and quality are no longer considered factors in seeking
                                                 degree  courses  or  higher  education  because  of  online
                                                 education.

                                                    After the discussion and clarifications, the teacher will give
                                               the activities to the students.

                              I am Jacquelyn A. Castro. I was born on November 22, 1985, in Escalante


                       Negros  Occidental.  I  am  currently  living  at  Lumina  Homes  Bagtas  Tanza  Cavite

                       Block 14 Lot 10 Phase 2. I am the third child of Mr. Charlo Palmones Aronales and

                       Thelma Quino Sico. I spent my younger years with my grandfather, Lope Leonesa

                       Sico,  since  at  an  early  age  my  parents  got  separated,  but  in  my  teenage  life  my

                       father took me and my siblings. He took care of us together with his new partner in

                       life,  Analuna  Jusayan.  Our  life  wasn’t  easy  living  together  with  half  a  brother,  a

                       stepsister, and a stepbrother. Love and care deprivation were roaring around in my


                       growing days, but those experiences served as a motivation to reach the peak part of

                       my dreams.

                              I  completed  my  elementary  education  at  Toboso  Central  School,  Toboso

                       Negros Occidental, and my secondary education at Escalante National High School,

                       Escalante Negros Occidental, in 2003 while I was a working student, battling with my


                       status and bad experiences during those years just to overcome and get graduated.

                              On April 23, 2016, I got married to Rolando Arlan Castro. By the year 2018, I

                       enrolled  at  Cavite  State  University—Tanza  Campus  and  accepted  a  Bachelor  of

                       Secondary Education major in Mathematics. In that same year, I was blessed with a

                       child, Psalmuel Averroes Castro, and he was born in that year, 2019. Combining my

                       studies and unexpected motherhood was another challenge I faced. How I spend my

                       time  in  my  school  together  with  my  child  without  the  support  of  our  parents  is


                       challenging  because  I  am  living  very  far  from  them  and  they  are  facing  their  own

                       battles in life to survive, but I hold on to the promises of God, declaring, "I have a

                       plan for you; a plan to prosper and not to harm you, a plan to give you hope and a

                       future." Those words are stronger than the current situation I am diving into.

                       Dear Readers,


                              This portfolio is a compilation of my complete practice teaching experience at

                       The First Uniting Christian School in Dasmarinas, Cavite. Through this portfolio, you

                       will be able to comprehend my journey to practice teaching success. How I overcame

                       every  hurdle  I've  faced  and  the  remedies  I  propose  to  make  those  tasks  less

                       daunting, particularly during this period of new normal training. How I improve myself

                       concerning  my  career  and  the  individuals  that  put  out  the  effort  and  sacrifice  to

                       advise  and  correct  me  for  me  to  do  well  during  my  experiences.  Everything  isn't


                       easy,  but  with  the  help  of  people  willing  to  provide  a  hand,  this  experience  is

                       possible. This was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. I see this as a solid starting point

                       for exploring a variety of possibilities. I wasn't just academically developed but also

                       emotionally. The event cultivated a passion I'd been keeping hidden in my heart. It

                       reminds me of why it is worth spending time waiting for your aspirations to come true.


                       I realized that the diversity I faced inside the classroom is valuable, so it will benefit

                       not just my future employment but also my overall viewpoint as I continue along the

                       route I have chosen. My journey does not end here; it is only the beginning of a real-

                       life situation in pursuing my desire.

                              Every  new  experience  is  often  not  delightful,  but  we  must  confront  the

                       unpleasant to grow. In every gloomy storm, there is always a rainbow. I cling to every

                       ray  of  hope  because  I  think  that  if  you're  on  the  correct  track,  every  wonderful


                       experience will succeed.



                                                                               JACQUELYN A. CASTRO

                              I would like to extend my warmest and deepest gratitude and appreciation to


                       the following people behind the success of this student teaching program:

                       Dr. GIL D. RAMOS, Mahisto, campus dean, for allowing us to grow into productive

                       and good students.

                              Prof.  Mildred  A.  Sebastian.  student  teaching  program  adviser,  for  her

                       kindness,  being  passionate,  immeasurable  support,  and  guidance  throughout  the

                       entire program.

                              Mrs. Janice Bohisan, cooperating school principal, for opening and allowing


                       me to be part of TFUCS, which gave way to fulfilling this experience.

                              Mr. Michael Aquino, the TFUCS junior high school coordinator, for accepting

                       me  to  be  part  of  this  school,  believing  in  me  that  I  can  do  my  job,  guiding  and

                       inspiring me to be positive in every circumstance we experienced.

                              For Ms. Rea F. Olleres, my CT, for the undying patience she bestowed so


                       that I would gain confidence in my experience; for the unending love and passion in

                       her  heart  to  teach;  for  the  immeasurable  support  to  become  successful  in  this

                       experience.

                              Mr.  Rolando  Castro,  my  ever-supportive  husband, for  his  unending  support

                       toward my heart's desire despite the circumstances we encountered, for his patience

                       during my busy days, and unending love even those times that I didn’t perform my

                       duty as a light in my home. To my son Psalmuel Averroes Castro and my family, that


                       serves  as  an  inspiration  and  unlimited  strength  to  never  give  up  and  to  all  my

                       classmates and friends who are always there when you need a shoulder to lean on,

                              Above  all,  to  God  Almighty,  for  giving  me  wisdom,  knowledge,  strength,

                       guidance, and blessing, I made all this rich experience possible.

                                                                               JACQUELYN A. CASTRO

                              Every  new  encounter  would  almost  certainly  bring  with  it  a  slew  of  fresh


                       insights.  I'm  embarking  on  an  adventure  in  this  new  chapter  of  my  life.  I  may  not

                       know how I can handle these new beginnings or how I will respond to every incident,

                       but  I  will  do  my  best  to  make  a  lasting  impression  that  will  be  remembered  and

                       treasured for a lifetime.

                              Since the school where I teach is a Christian school, my expectations for my

                       kids are that they are well-mannered, have good conduct, are courteous, and most

                       importantly, are God-fearing. There may be a smarter student, just as there may be


                       an  ordinary  student,  but  I  want  to  take  this  chance  to  let  the  students  know  that

                       everybody can learn, even if they have struggled to understand mathematics. There

                       is a wide range of learners from numerous backgrounds and personalities. Since it is

                       a Christian school, there will be fewer personality conflicts, as I relate to being raised

                       in a Christian world where we are always taught to speak nicely and to care about


                       the people we encounter. I assumed I would not encounter behavioral issues, but if

                       that were to occur, the weapons I obtained at the university through which I earned

                       them would be sufficient in dealing with the uncertainty.

                              My expectation of my cooperating teacher is that she'll be a good, kind, and

                       understanding teacher. I will be supervised by a well-equipped teacher who will also

                       provide  me  with  a  lot  of  assistance.  I  am  nervous,  but  I  believe  that  if  you  are  a

                       teacher,  the  opportunity  to  extend  your  service  is  always  there,  especially  for  the


                       sake of the students. It won't always be ideal, but I'm sure I'll learn a lot from her.

                              I anticipate that the cooperating school is in the right spot and on the correct

                       track. If I taught in a private school, I wanted to end up in a Christian school since

                       that corresponded to my principles as a born-again Christian, and it would be easier








                                                                1]]></page><page Index="249"><![CDATA[to adapt to the environment if you found a connection with it. It is through it that I am

                       supposed to be here at the proper time to serve the institution.

                              My expectations for the student teaching program are to improve and apply

                       my  knowledge  in  my  choice  and  to  acquire  abilities  and  approaches  in  the


                       teaching/learning  process  that  are practically  useful to  obtain  confidence  in

                       performing  my  job.  I'd  want  to  start  a  new  relationship  while  also  making  new

                       connections  that  would  undoubtedly  help  me  on  my  way  to  pursuing  my  passion,

                       which is teaching. I also hope to meet new individuals who will help me develop my

                       personality,  both  intellectually  and  emotionally.  I  also  expect  to  add  or  leave


                       something of value, extra experience, and understanding that I have garnered from

                       my  four  years  of  schooling  at  the  university  that  has  invested  effort  and  time  in

                       shaping and preparing me for this sort of experience that would have an impact on

                       the people or students I have just met.

                              I'll have to make a lot of adjustments, especially because I'll be working in a

                       new regular education setting. It may not be simple at first, but I think as humans, we

                       have  a  character  that  can  quickly  adapt  to  our  circumstances.  This  has  been  a


                       fantastic adventure that will serve as a firm foundation for me to become stable in the

                       face of any difficulty that life may throw at me.

                              I'm  excited  and  terrified  at  the  same  moment,  yet  the  sensation  of

                       approaching my dreams is stronger. I'll collect the positive and inspirational events to

                       serve as a springboard for moving forward, as well as the negative and tough ones to


                       serve as an incentive to do better. Every season of our lives is designed to help us

                       mature.  If  I  feel  awkward,  I  shall  embrace  it  since  this  serves  as  a  deterrent  that

                       something about my personality must be changed.

                              The classroom management that we usually applied was before it started: we

                       first prayed, exchanged greetings, and reminded the students of the virtual room's

                       rules and regulations, which are: opening the camera as much as possible, turning


                       off the microphone whenever the teacher is in the middle of a discussion to avoid

                       unnecessary noise, and only speaking after the teacher has called them to speak.

                       They  can  utilize  the  chat  box  to  express  their  concerns,  including  going  to  the

                       bathroom if they have any. When students understand a question, they can show it

                       by nodding or giving a thumbs up. Every time we verify their attendance, we do it one


                       by one. If the student's internet connection gets interrupted, students can access the

                       discussion saved in the LMS. Since the students receive five minutes to prepare for

                       their forthcoming topic, professors are indeed allowed to teach for 55 minutes every

                       session.  I  try  to  keep  distractions,  such  as  background  noises,  to  a  minimum

                       because  they  can  cause  learners  to  lose  concentration  during  lessons.  I  am

                       constantly  with  my  camera  on,  have  practiced  being  pleasant  and  friendly  to

                       everyone, and use praise to inspire my students. To provide a pleasing image to my


                       students, I always make sure that I am tidy and dressed in my uniform. On the other

                       hand, the kids are also encouraged to get well-dressed and prepared. I make sure I

                       enter the virtual room as soon as possible to avoid any technological issues.

                              Some of the teaching strategies we use include always communicating with

                       the students so that every reluctance on their behalf is eliminated, specifically once


                       they have concerns regarding tasks or need clarification before or after the session.

                       There  is  a  mix  of  synchronous  and  asynchronous  instruction.  For  several  of  the

                       learners  who  didn't  attend  because  of  important  matters,  there  is  a  conveniently

                       available recorded lecture where they may play back at their own time and speed.

                       The  LMS,  as  the  tool  used,  was  amazing  with  a  comprehensive  bundle  of

                       teaching because  of  the  readily  available  resources  which  are  beneficial  to  the

                       students. I  will  ensure  that  there  will  be  an  engaging  discussion,  such  as  student



                                                                3]]></page><page Index="251"><![CDATA[participation  and  grouping,  where  they  may  share  their  thoughts  in  small  or  large

                       groups. I utilized a learning games application to pique their attention in a way that

                       was relevant to their everyday activities, as we've seen video games are already a

                       part of their lives. To combine the lessons, I used audio videos, which are beneficial


                       to the students' mastery. Visual displays, on the other hand, quickly pique students'

                       interest  in  attending  class.  This  is  also  beneficial  in  relating  each  topic  to  the

                       students' real-life experiences. I utilized interactive technology that gave the students

                       a crown that they could use to get access to educational materials such as pens and

                       other materials. In terms of activity completion and critical announcements, students


                       will  be  informed  or  provided  alerts  within  a click.  My  CT  has  also  scheduled

                       homeroom  meetings for  the  students,  which  serve  as  an  excellent  technique  for

                       understanding more about the students' interests, hobbies, abilities, and even their

                       progress, which occurs every Monday. I cooperated with my CT on whatever lessons

                       were to be addressed; I always let her review and gain approval. She spent extra

                       time on any improvements and suggestions that were required as well as appropriate

                       for the children.


                              During my first day of observation at the TFUCS virtual room, I felt surprised

                       at  how  well  the  virtual room  appeared  compared  to  the  version  I  used  in  school.

                       Once  a student interacts,  you  can award  participants  a trophy  as  a  kind  of

                       reinforcement  for  their  learning.  When  working  within  a  small  group  on  the  task,

                       the student  can access  a  breakroom  where  they  can  openly  explore  and  discuss


                       various ideas. There are random selector tools that can be used for students during

                       the series of questions segment, where the students receive a chance to be chosen,

                       particularly those who don't often appear on the virtual stage. It is a comprehensive

                       set of the virtual room since it can capture screenshots inside the program, which is

                       useful,  especially  during  the  presentation,  and  a  video  gallery  where  you  would

                       observe  all  students  throughout  the  assessment  time  to  preserve  the  exam's

                       reliability.  There  are  also  several  educational  resources  accessible,  such  as  the



                                                                4]]></page><page Index="252"><![CDATA[Cartesian  plane,  which  is  particularly  beneficial  for  on-the-spot  presentation  and

                       visualization of the students' activities, as well as forms, lines, dice, and many more.

                       You may set up the students' stage by using a timer so that the student appears on

                       the  virtual  room's  stage.  Simultaneously,  students  could  catch  up  on  the  lesson  if


                       they missed the  discussion  because  there  is  a playback  feature  that  is  accessible

                       without having to send the clips to the students; this is especially useful when trying

                       to  save  disk  space.  As  a  result,  I  can  say  that  the  software  used  by  the  school

                       bridges the gaps in the new method of learning. The students benefit from the full

                       package of features and benefits that allow them to study more comfortably. Not only


                       the  children  but  also  the  professors  found  the  environment  to  be  favorable  for

                       learning.

                              The  lesson  plan  we  used  was  the  PIVOT-IDEA  Lesson  Emblem,  which

                       stands  for  Introduction,  Development,  Engagement,  and  Assimilation.  In  the

                       introduction, we usually give the students short activities that will equip all types of

                       learners with abilities while also allowing them to understand the connection between

                       the lesson and their real-life contexts, resulting in increased learner engagement with


                       the  task.  The  development  section  is  where  students  gain  mastery  of  learning,

                       and the topic is generally discussed and elaborated. It was via learning activities that

                       learners  were  provided  with  materials  and  situations  that  were  conducive  to  their

                       learning. During the engagement phase, students participate in experiential learning.

                       It's the portion where students engage themselves in experiential learning rather than


                       factual learning. They used what they had learned in the lessons in their daily lives

                       on occasion. The learners take meaningful and reflective learning in the final section,

                       assimilation.  When  I  ask  the  students  what  they've  learned,  they  frequently

                       summarize the material. It is frequently an action that is anchored and incorporated

                       into  the  learner's  cognitive  framework.  When  this  was  put  into  a  lesson  plan,  the

                       elements that  were  used  were:  explore, firm  up,  develop,  and  transfer  of  learning.

                       This  lesson  plan  is  still  based  on  the  MELC  from  the  DepEd  curriculum. For  the



                                                                5]]></page><page Index="253"><![CDATA[assessment of students that we usually create for, through the ClassIn application,

                       performance  took  place.  They  may  also  look  back  on  the  students'  performance,

                       including  how  they  competed  for  trophies  and  prizes,  as  well  as participation as  a

                       marker of students' engagement. You can also track their attendance as well as the

                       length of time spent in the virtual room. Teachers as well as children, because of the


                       epidemic,  received  a  great  deal  of  assistance  in  lightening  up  the  problems.  The

                       different assessments we implemented were individual activities and groups, as well

                       as  performance  activities utilizing  rubrics  to evaluate the  students.  Multiple-choice,

                       open-ended  questions,  defining,  problem-solving,  creating,  demonstrating,

                       comparing,  and  many  other  types  of  evaluation  were  employed.  every  end  of  the

                       topic. Trophies serve as reinforcement during informal evaluation, which often takes

                       place during active recitation and games activities and is stressed before each class


                       begins  to  encourage and  appreciate  students who  engaged  well  in  the  previous

                       discussion.  The  students  look  to  be  quite  engaged,  based  on  my  observations.

                       Students grow increasingly determined each time they receive a trophy as a reward.

                       They engaged well, were eager to learn, asked about topics that bothered them, and

                       were exceptionally polite and respectful students. The only aspect of a learner that


                       bothers  me  is  how  they  respond  to  specific  exercises,  since  not  all  students  are

                       engaged in finishing the task. Even when the deadline for submitting grades to the

                       admin was approaching, I've had students who did not react, even after you informed

                       them  several  times  that  they  needed  to  perform  their  job.  In  this  scenario,  I  just

                       inform my CT of the students' condition, and she takes the required action by alerting

                       the  parents'  attention  to  the  situation.  In relation  to  assessment,  such  as giving  a

                       monthly test, the teacher's strategy is to allow students to repeat the exam if they fail

                       few of the students chose to remain silent listeners. They don't participate much, but I

                       don't  think  they  don't  know  the  answer  because  sometimes  when  they  appear  on


                       stage and you call them, they know the answer. I understand this is part of a diverse

                       classroom, which is why the random selector provided by the ClassIn apps is a great

                       help so that everyone gets a chance to participate at least once.

                              My view of my cooperating school was that they considered us to become a

                       part of them because the school invited the student teacher to participate in important


                       occasions. They required that we submit the entire week's journal every Saturday.

                       They set up a group chat for us so that we could communicate with all the ST, CT,

                       and  school  ST  coordinators easily.  My  CT  was  advised  to  have  a  one-on-one

                       meeting  with  the  ST at  the  end  of  the  session  to  discuss  any  improvements  and

                       feedback.  We  are  advised  to  get  a  good  internet  connection  and  an  appropriate

                       device to utilize during the emersion at the start of the ST class.

                              My  CTs'  feedback about  my  performance  throughout  the  class  delivery  is


                       extremely  beneficial,  especially  when  I  make  lapses  after  discussion  and  need  to

                       enhance  my  delivery.  She  corrected  me,  particularly  in  terms  of  my  word

                       pronunciation,  which  has  a  Cebuano  touch  to  it.  She's  also  there  to  offer  positive

                       comments whenever I do a good job, which is an overwhelming feeling for me.

                              The overarching point from classroom observation is that the school did an


                       excellent job selecting the appropriate application software to facilitate teaching and

                       learning.  They  choose  the  best-quality  application  software.  These  measures

                       alleviate the pandemic's impact on teaching and learning. The best strategy I have is

                       to think about the grouping activity in terms of assessments because it's quite helpful

                       in ensuring that no students are left behind.

                              As a teacher, I must deliver the lesson in line with the MELC curriculum as

                       well  as  the  rules  of  the institution  where I  have chosen to  practice  my profession.

                       Every  time  I  teach,  I  want  to  develop  skills  that  will  help  them  flourish  since  it  is


                       essential  to  emphasize  the  value  of  learning  mathematics.  I  also  aim  to  complete

                       concepts to be addressed for comprehension, particularly some of the introductory

                       and fundamental parts of each session, since this serves as the basis for students

                       to relate the topics in the future, especially once they are complex. I should strive to

                       get the students to generate a product that is an application of information that we


                       often use and enjoy in our everyday lives as much as feasible. The students have a

                       distinct  level  of  grasp  of  the  topic  at  the  same  time  as  their talents  upon

                       understanding. Despite being in the same school, they have various age gaps; some

                       are 12, 13 and the other is 14 years old. They are also culturally diverse and come

                       from a range of backgrounds, as my 8th grade Genesis class includes a Korean and

                       a  Filipino  student.  I  divided  each  unit  into  three  meetings,  each  taking  at  least  55

                       minutes  of  the time  because  TFUCS  schools  require  you  to  teach  one  unit  every


                       week.  I  frequently  used  visual  presentations,  analogies  in  their  real  activities,  and

                       games to help students connect the subject to their interests. I employed audiovisual

                       or technology, like video presentations, as an add-on to their topic understanding, as

                       well  as  students'  hands-on  activities,  manipulatives,  and  visual  displays.  Individual

                       learning, large or small group discussions, practical learning activities, taking notes,


                       and observation learning are how the students spend their time. Students received

                       help  in  every  lesson  through  informal  evaluation  and  informal  assessment.  After

                       every unit lesson, there is a formal evaluation in the form of individual tasks and, on

                       occasion,  group  exercises.  Informal  assessment  in  the  sense  of  observational

                       learning  via  open-ended  questions  or  recitation,  observation  of  students'  behavior

                       during specific activities, and dialogue gives me a signal that the students are still

                       interested  in  the  class.  The  class  was  chapter-end  with  a  summary  and  review,



                                                                8]]></page><page Index="256"><![CDATA[including  papers  being  collected  occasionally  when  there  is  an  individual  activity,

                       assignments  being  given,  and  students  being  allowed  to  ask  questions  and  get

                       clarification on the topic of the day. When it came to submitting activities, my CT's

                       approach was to always offer students extra privileges; she accepted them even if


                       they  were  late.  The  students'  activities  were  graded  on  each  accurate  item  they

                       received,  and  I  used  rubrics  to  guarantee  a  consistent  grading  method  when  they

                       were  grouped  in  a  performance  activity.  Every  lesson  I've  prepared  improves  the

                       foundation;  it helps students  rapidly  comprehend  the  associated  concepts  in  the

                       subsequent  conflict  problem.  When  it  comes  to  relating  every  learning  session  to


                       their real-life experience, the topic's relevancy may be a tremendous help. All of this

                       is crucial knowledge for upcoming lectures and dialogues that will link old and new

                       information.

                              Every  time  I  teach,  I  feel  accomplished  because  of  my  students'

                       performances. They contribute effectively while also improving their test scores on

                       every evaluation. Then, after instructing, I received positive feedback from my CT,

                       which happens almost every time I do a session. Finally, I am successful because of


                       my self-evaluation.

                              My assessment of my preparation for actual teaching is that I am confident

                       and prepared to take the first step toward using what I've learned in the classroom. I

                       have a variety of strategies and methods for unlocking students' potential abilities,

                       talents, and skills so that they can explore and expand their horizons to achieve their


                       objectives.  Despite  my  weaknesses,  I  prefer  to  soar  high  to  teach  the  future

                       generation; my weaknesses will serve as a foundation for me to strive even harder to

                       be the best in the field in which I was born to participate. I am self-sufficient in terms

                       of  learning;  I  can  finish  the  task  that  has  been  assigned  to  me.  I  am  resourceful

                       enough to help the classroom come alive with a wealth of fresh experiences to aid

                       the kids  in  their  learning,  especially  for varied  learners. When  dealing  with  issues,

                       obstacles, and disputes in the classroom, I listen to all sides of the story and seek



                                                                9]]></page><page Index="257"><![CDATA[guidance,  especially  from  my  superior,  before  reaching  a  conclusion  or  making  a

                       situation. I am enthusiastic about my job and profession, which gives me a strong

                       foundation  on  which  to  face  any  problems  that  may  emerge  in  the  future.  I've

                       issues. I can create a classroom where there is harmony, respect for one another,

                       especially  when  it  comes  to  offering  opinions;  kindness,  love,  camaraderie,  and  a

                       cooperative learning, which will prepare students for real-world working tactics. I'm

                       foundation and my individuality.

                       Coordinator,  and I,  along  with  the  other  four  students,  will  meet through  Zoom for

                       orientation about practical teaching at The First Uniting Christian School (TFUCS),

                       our  cooperating  school.  It  consists  of  two  secondary  math  majors  and  three

                       secondary English majors from Cavite State University's Tanza Campus. We are told

                       about their teaching and learning platform and the Classin apps and are encouraged

                       to download and learn how to use them. We had to present three components of the


                       school's  grading  system:  observation  and  teaching;  a  learning  plan;  and  learning

                       materials  such  as  PowerPoint.  To  avoid  misunderstandings,  Mr.  Jhon  also

                       encourages us to collaborate closely with our cooperating teachers, particularly when

                       presenting PowerPoint or even learning plans to the students in our various classes.

                       He  also  recommended  sending  our  daily  journals  weekly  and  supplying


                       recommendations on how to develop an interactive learning environment to bridge

                       the gap caused by remote education, a new kind of learning. He discussed how to

                       keep students engaged in an online class and shared his methods, like having them

                       engage in an entertaining game while they learn.


                              The  meeting  was  full  of  fresh  insights  and  understandings  about  school

                       standards  and  rules,  which  helped  to  alleviate  the  discomfort  created  by  this  new


                       chapter and journey toward embracing the art of shaping the minds of the younger

                       generation as well as those who yearn for knowledge and education.

                              This  is  my  first  day  addressing  a  grade  (grade  8  students)  at  TFUCS.  My

                       cooperating teacher informed me that the first class, Grade 8 Genesis, begins at 8:00

                       a.m. I've been assured that all I'll do is observe them upon taking their task. I met Ms.


                       Joan, who is taking over the class while Ms. Rea is out for vaccination. I had difficulty

                       viewing  the  online  class  because  I  was  unfamiliar  with  their  classroom  platform,

                       Classin. There are icons and tools that do not appear on my monitor. When Ms. Joan

                       told  me  to  go  to  the  video  gallery  to  see  the  kids,  I  was  a  little  confused  since  I

                       couldn't find it, although she allowed me and gave me a key to access the tools.



                              Ms. Rea scheduled a meeting for me late in the afternoon, around 2:00 p.m.,

                       to go over the platform used in the teaching and learning process in further detail. We

                       began by introducing each other and sharing some personal information to lighten

                       the mood, which I greatly appreciated because I gained confidence because of our

                       conversations, and I am relieved because all my doubts about using the apps have


                       vanished since she thoroughly explained each feature to me. She also provides me

                       with background on the students, and I was surprised to discover that grade 8 holds

                       two Korean students, which put pressure on me to speak the language that is most

                       convenient for everyone. She also informed me that she oversaw grades 8 (Genesis)

                       and 7 (Sarah).



                              Our  conversation  ended  up  by  uplifting  each  other.  We  were  able  to

                       overcome the hurdles we face because of this undesirable scenario by collaborating,

                       sharing, and exchanging thoughts and ideas; strengthening one another in times of

                       hardship and weaknesses; and being open to all issues that we meet. We addressed

                       this  together  by  supplying  solutions  that  help  the  organization  that  cradles  us  and


                       supplies  an  opportunity  for  us  to  be  successful  in  our  chosen  career.  We  will  be

                       successful if we work together to reach our goals.






                                                               12]]></page><page Index="260"><![CDATA[Day 3: 07 October 2021

                               She  went  on  to teach the  new  lesson,  which  is  the  operation  with rational

                       numbers. Upon seeing the class, students are eager to take part in answering the

                       question. When students are called, the instructor pulls their profiles to the middle of


                       the monitor and awards them with a trophy symbol after taking part. This motivates

                       children to keep learning and engage in activities. She also called students who had

                       not  yet  been  awarded  to  give  them  a  chance.  So  far,  all  students  have  an open

                       conversation  during  the  teaching  and  learning  process,  which  is  an  excellent  start

                       toward instilling a sense of belonging in them.



                              When I  saw my cooperating  teacher's methods  for  presenting  the  lesson, I

                       appreciated  her  approach  since  she  starts  with  the  simpler  stages  of  solving  a

                       problem,  which  is  a  solid  foundation  for  the  students  to  be  prepared  for  more

                       complex work in the future. The discussion ended with a glitch since the PowerPoint

                       was malfunctioning; at the last part of the discussion, there was uncontrollable fast-


                       forwarding of PowerPoint slides, which made me ponder and ask myself, "How about

                       in the actual demo, if this scenario arises, what would be my approach to overcome

                       it?" I don't have a solution to that notion right now, but I feel that in the long term, an

                       idea will emerge to deal with the problem.

                              Ms.  Clarrise  adopts  a  firsthand  approach  to  learning.  She  allowed  the

                       learners to interact individually with the virtual room tools, such as plotting points on a


                       graph. The children are also highly engaged; they are given a prize every time they

                       contribute,  and  I  can  see  that  they  are  pleased  each  time  they  receive  it,  which

                       serves as a motivator for them to take part in the conversation.


                              This  day  reminded  me  that  various  professors  use  different  tactics,  and


                       different individuals use different methods depending on their comprehension level.









                                                               13]]></page><page Index="261"><![CDATA[Day 4: 08 October 2021



                              It's my third day of observation in  Genesis 8th grade, and I arrived at 7:58

                       a.m.  Ms.  Rea  Orelles  began  the  class  with  prayers,  followed  by  a  check  of

                       attendance  (all  pupils  were  present  so  far),  and  a  review  of  the  previous  lesson.

                       Before moving on to a lesson about the slope of a line, one of the students (Zach)

                       inquired  about  a  task  response  that  was  being  overlooked,  which  Ms.  Rea  swiftly

                       addressed, and the students were satisfied with my cooperating teacher's response.

                       She then went through the lecture with the class and asked each student a question


                       to figure out whether they had grasped the content. Some students get the correct

                       answer,  while  others  don't.  This  method  is  beneficial  for  monitoring  how  students

                       process  information  so  that  individuals  who  have  mistaken  answers  may  be

                       enlightened  and  corrected  later.  Those  who  took  part  in  the  same  scenario  were

                       given a trophy as a prize, a simple incentive to have an interactive classroom.



                              Since I only had one math class today, she let me see her grade 9 science

                       section,  Samuel's,  around  9  a.m.,  which  I  viewed  as  an  opportunity  to  gain

                       experience more knowledge and strategies while instructing the kids. I see that she

                       uses more graphics to emphasize the topic in this session, which is another way of

                       catching the learners' attention. It is also helpful, especially for visual learners. During

                       this, another day of observation, my takeaway is that when I meet clarification about


                       problems caused by overlook, whether from the students or me as a teacher, I must

                       listen to her/his side, bringing out their concerns and allowing them to explain until

                       both sides are enlightened. Then give him/her assurance to recheck his concern. As

                       a teacher, we want our students to think aloud rather than say nothing.
















                                                               14]]></page><page Index="262"><![CDATA[Day 5: 11 October 2021

                              I had two classes today: one for Ms. Rea, Grade 7, Sarah, and another for

                       Ms. Clarisse, David.

                              Ms.  Rea  used  to  be  the  PowerPoint,  which  was  the  learning  material  she

                       provided during the conversation. My cooperating teacher employs a question-and-

                       answer format during the discussion to see if the students understand the material.

                       Students were urged to raise their hands as they answered, but she also utilises a


                       responder icon in the virtual tool to choose who will respond next. When students

                       take part, they automatically receive a trophy award as encouragement to become

                       eager  to  take  part  in  a  teaching  and  learning  process,  regardless  of  whether  the

                       answer  is  correct  or  not.  What  matters  most  is  that  they  know  how  to  express

                       themselves, and as teachers, we are there to connect them to the correct one. She

                       can incorporate the prior lesson into a new one, making the discussion simpler. A


                       closing prayer was spoken at the end of the lesson.

                              Ms. Clarrise introduces me to the class, then she checks the attendance. Her

                       teaching method includes ensuring that students follow a step-by-step procedure that

                       proves  the  pattern  of  obtaining  the  proper  insight  into  the  problems.  This  is  quite

                       useful for students in tracing the solution's flow. She uses a do-it-yourself approach,

                       allowing students to think and solve problems on a virtual board. This is an excellent


                       strategy to use, especially if the topic is difficult, because it is simpler for students to

                       recall the procedure if they have done it before. She also enables virtually everyone

                       to take part. She also has an integration process of teaching from the basic parts of

                       the  lesson  into  a  little  bit  of  complication,  which  leads  the  students  to  understand

                       conveniently.










                                                               15]]></page><page Index="263"><![CDATA[Day 6: 12 October 2021

                              Ms. Rea, my cooperating teacher, did not discuss the normal pattern in class

                       in grade 7, but instead gave the students a brief exercise. This method is excellent

                       for mastering the subject as well as assessing and evaluating the students' learning


                       experiences.  Offering  a  short  activity  is  identical  to  re-chucking  the  knowledge  to

                       keep it longer. The exercise was presented in PowerPoint, In the same way, they will

                       earn a trophy reward if they take part.

                              Ms. Rea used the symbol as a pattern when explaining the solution to each

                       problem  so  that  the  students  would  remember  more,  especially  when  it  came  to


                       placing the correct answer. For example, when converting an improper fraction into a

                       mixed number, she uses the letter J to emphasize how to write the mixed number

                       after finding the quotient of the improper fraction. The letter J acts as a reminder to

                       help clarify which part should be put first to have a correct mixed number form. This

                       sign reminded me of mnemonics, which we use to help us remember information for

                       a  longer  period  because  we  cannot  deny  that  we  will  meet  varied  learners  in  our

                       class, and not all students are good at the same time. There are times when they will


                       face obstacles in diverse ways. Therefore, symbols and mnemonics are essential in

                       this section.

                              On  the  other  hand,  Ms.  Clarise  had  a  performance  activity  in  her  Level  2

                       Mathematics class today. She split the class into four groups and gave each one a

                       task to complete. She uses breakrooms to allow students to freely discuss their work.


                       The professors' inventiveness and imagination truly cover the gaps produced by this

                       online platform.

                              This  reminds  me  that  teachers  must  not  only  send  effort  but creativity  and

                       innovation for a mathematics class to produce a long-lasting learning experience for

                       a student, which is necessary and proper in the twenty-first century.









                                                               16]]></page><page Index="264"><![CDATA[Day 7: 13 October 2021

                              Today  I  saw  two  classrooms.  During  my  observation  in  grade  8,  Genesis,

                       which begins at 8:00 a.m., the instructor delivers the lesson using PowerPoint. What

                       I've observed in her PowerPoint as learning material is that she changes the design

                       for each session. It's a simple design, but the characters she employs, such as font

                       size,  are  all  readable.  The  combination  of  PowerPoint-like  hues  is  ideal  and

                       incredibly soothing to the eyes.



                              The kids are highly receptive and ready to learn, while others had connection

                       issues today due to the terrible weather, they persevered and patiently waited to get

                       connected  to  attend  class,  as  Hannah,  one  of  the  students,  recounted  her

                       experience.  During  the  content  delivery,  everyone  is  engaged.  I  was  only  there  to


                       listen  to  the  discussion  because  I  hadn't  started  my  paperwork  yet,  and  I  awaited

                       more instructions, particularly for the task she had set for me.


                              My realization and a kind of reminder for today are that, as teachers, we must

                       always  extend  our  very  deep  consideration,  especially  for  the  time  of  distance

                       learning,  as  I  and  the  students  experienced  today  when  they  arrived  late  due  to


                       connection  problems,  particularly  when  severe  weather  strikes.  According  to  Ms.

                       Rea's guidance, one or two people may experience lag, but the show must continue;

                       the teaching process must not be disrupted since there are still more than 20 pupils

                       waiting  for  us  inside  the  virtual  room,  waiting  for  the  knowledge  they  require.  We

                       must just keep on and not be worried since the learners who were disrupted will be

                       able to rewatch the entire teaching and learning process. There is a fantastic platform


                       that can replace the need that everyone has felt.











                                                               17]]></page><page Index="265"><![CDATA[Day 8: 14 October 2021

                              Today I had three classes: one math and one science lesson with Ms. Rea,

                       and one with Ms. Clarrise. In science class, I was allowed to see if I had more free

                       time, but if I was overworked, my cooperating teacher told me it was fine not to go.


                       Regarding Ms. Clarisse's mathematics class, I am also given the choice of attending

                       or not attending. However, because I don't have much work yet, I decided to attend

                       because it is an opportunity to learn more about teaching techniques and strategies

                       that will be useful in future actual work for future students. I also sent my first lesson

                       plan to Miss Rea today to be examined and evaluated.



                              In seventh grade, I resumed my observations with Ms. Rea. She began by

                       giving a review of the prior session before moving on to the exercises. She offers

                       each person a unique exercise and asks them to present their responses one by one.



                       The students are highly driven and ready to take part, and they are quite involved,

                       except  for  those  who  are  trailing.  They  are  also  very  courteous.  The  class  has  a

                       vibrant vibe to it.


                              Then  I  went  to  Ms.  Clarrise's  grade  10  math  proverbs  lesson.  They  just

                       continued  the  earlier  meeting's  presentation  of  performance  group  assignments


                       created by the kids. They deliver it collaboratively. The whole session has concluded

                       on a positive note and with a lively presentation.


                              In this day, I understood that mathematics is not a boring topic. It's not simply

                       about  digging  out  numbers  and  solving  puzzles  till  our  brain  cells  are  drained.  It

                       needs  careful  preparation  and  exploration  for  the  entire  class  to  feel  delighted  in


                       learning rather than just thinking harder.











                                                               18]]></page><page Index="266"><![CDATA[Day 9: 15 October 2021

                              Today  was  the  last  day  of  the  week,  and  I  had  two  classes:  one  in  the

                       morning with Ms. Rea in Grade 8 Genesis Mathematics, and one in the afternoon

                       with  Ms.  Clarisse  in  Grade  9  Mathematics.  At  the  same  time,  I  sent  my  second


                       lesson  plan  for  Grade  8  Genesis  to  Ms.  Rea  for  review.  Although  I  have  not  yet

                       received any comments on my work, I still have two more lesson plans to be given

                       before Thursday. I was also informed that this month is an assessment month for all

                       students,  which  begins  next  week.  I've  been  given  the  task  of  creating  a  module,

                       lesson  plan,  and  PowerPoint  for  two  weeks'  worth  of  teaching  that  will  be  utilized


                       when the class resumes. I'll be the one to deliver the lesson. As a result, Ms. Rea

                       recommended that I deliver the first module to her first before discussing it with the

                       rest of the class. This excites me since it marks the start of another chapter of major

                       learning experiences in my practice teaching. I am grateful for this new chance since

                       it  has  provided  me  with  the  opportunity  to  gain  experience  how  to  transfer  fresh

                       knowledge to the younger generation in a real-world setting.

                              Ms.  Rea Orelles  opened  the class  with  prayers, followed  by  an  attendance


                       check, a review of the earlier lesson, and finally a discussion. While the conversation

                       is going on, she asks the kids questions to think about, which helps them catch and

                       understand the material.

                       The kids were eager to respond and highly engaged; they were quite active inside

                       the virtual room, with everyone racing to raise their hands and respond to questions.


                       They are polite and respectful.

                              Today, I discovered that learning happens everywhere; no gaps, issues, or

                       barriers  can  stop  it  if  everyone  is  hungry  for  knowledge  and  prioritizes  seeking

                       relevant information, especially those that add value to our professions.









                                                               19]]></page><page Index="267"><![CDATA[Day 10:  18 October 2021

                              I  went  to  two  classrooms  today:  one  for  Miss  Rea,  grade  7,  Sarah,  and

                       another for Miss Clarisse, grade 9, David. During my free time, I am always working

                       on my papers. By the afternoon, I had finished it and sent it to Miss Rea for review.


                              Since this week is the second assessment month, we are just doing a review

                       for the students so that they are prepared for their evaluation. After the prayer and

                       checking of attendance, she presented the PowerPoint to the class.  So, there was

                       interaction and an exchange of ideas about every certain topic.

                              During  the  review,  the  students  are  quite  engaged.  They  were  unafraid  to


                       express  their  opinions  and  ideas.  They  are  eager  to  learn  and  extremely  active

                       throughout  the  day,  and  they  are  praised  for  it.  Then,  as  the  review  progresses,

                       students jot down essential topics, which is a terrific way for them to recall more.

                              Around  2:00  p.m.,  I  went  to  Miss  Clarrise's  class.  Miss  Clarisse  was

                       completing the remaining topics on quadratic functions in preparation for the monthly

                       exam.  During  the  conversation,  the  students  were  engaged,  answering  questions,

                       and providing examples. She is extremely hands-on with the students, enabling them


                       to participate via the virtual board. The courses ended with an announcement that a

                       graded recitation would be held the following day. This notion is an excellent first step

                       in  getting  students  ready  for  the  next  evaluation.  The  graded  oral  recitation  will

                       inspire students to study, and it will be extremely beneficial to them, especially if an

                       exam is coming; it will enable us to lessen the students' brain strain.


                              Today's  realization:  there  was  always  a  fresh  start  and  a  chance  to  learn

                       every day as we awoke and entered a brand-new day. We only need to pay great

                       attention to every detail to grasp the significance of the small things and ideas that

                       come from trusted individuals in our lives.

                              I  attended  four  classes  today:  two  in  the  morning  with  Mis  Rea,  grade  7

                       Sarah, and grade 8 Genesis, and two in the afternoon with Mis Clarisse in Grade 10


                       Proverbs, at the same time, grade 9 David.

                              Ms. Rea proceeded to review the students for them to be prepared for their

                       first-day assessment, which begins tomorrow. So far, the discussion has been lively,

                       and  the  children  have  done  well  in  various  exercises. It  is the same  with  Genesis

                       grade 8. Everyone has done fantastically well.


                              In  Grade  10  Math  Proverbs  with  Mis  Clarrise,  she  moved  on  to  graded

                       recitation  as  part  of  the  preparation  for  the  approaching  exam.  She  chooses  the

                       name of the person who must answer the question using the wheels of fortune, while

                       also using the ziteboard for some more room to think through their response.

                              I discovered that the wheels are preferable to using than any random selector

                       since everyone gets a chance to be selected. However, in a virtual room's random

                       selection, there is a propensity to call the same individual again.


                              Grade  9  will  be  approached  in  the  same  way.  She  begins  recording  oral

                       recitations. She has a habit of being quite consistent in every approach she takes on

                       any  given  day,  while  also  experimenting  with  various  ways  on  other  days.  In  this

                       aspect of being creative and innovative, I love her approach to dealing with students,

                       as  it  allows  her  to  be  highly  effective  in  educating  them.  This  reminds  me  of  the


                       consistency  in  the  delivery  of  your  lessons  and  methods  on  the  same  day,

                       particularly in terms of the resources you utilize in that class. As the day  ended, I

                       understood that I shouldn't be scared to experiment with other tools and platforms to

                       improve my teaching methods because, on my part, I have hesitation and fear that if I

                       explore,  I  might  experience  some  difficulties  which  cause  delays  in  delivering  the

                       content.

                              Today is the first day of giving an exam for their 2nd monthly assessment. I

                       attended  only  one  class, Grade  7  Sarah.  I  observe  how they take  an  exam.  Then


                       Miss Rea discussed with me how to give the examinations to the students in class.

                       Then,  she  later  instructed  me  that  I  would  be  the  one  giving  the  exam  for  the

                       students of grade 9 science David, but unfortunately, we encountered some trouble

                       because when I was about to enter, Miss Rea didn’t yet add me to the class of grade

                       9  science  David,  since  the  students  were  already  waiting  in  the  virtual  class,  we


                       suspended  the  schedule  and  she  was  the  one  handing  the  students.  I  was  only

                       scheduled  for  tomorrow's  exam.  which  is  Grade  10,  Samuel.  I  just  received  her

                       schedule  for  this  2nd-month  assessment  for  me  to  be  aware  of  the  flow  of  the

                       examination schedule and the process of how to give the students an exam, and I

                       learned that the first thing to do before giving the exam is go to the Rooster icon and

                       change  the  30-to-10-minute  timer  so  that  the  students  will  be  moving  on  the  front

                       stage of the virtual room. The next step is opening the gallery, choosing the test, and


                       setting the  timer  to  45 minutes.  This  experience  is  another  way  of  learning  that  is

                       needed to be a treasure.

                              During  the  examination  in  the  Grade  7  section,  Sarah,  Mis  Rea,  and  I

                       requested to open the camera for all the students. This act serves as strong reliability

                       in  taking  the  test. Students  are  highly  attentive  throughout  tests,  focused  on  their


                       exams and following directions.

                              Every  moment  I  unlocked  the  new  potential  for  development  within  me,  I

                       appreciated  it.  Today  is  a  fresh  batch  of  learning  experiences.  This  was  another

                       accomplishment for me, and as time goes on, my stockpile of ideas grows, which is

                       beneficial in my quest to transmit wisdom to the young.








                                                               22]]></page><page Index="270"><![CDATA[Day 13:  21 October 2021



                               I attended only one class today, which was Science Grade 10 with Samuel. I


                       followed the procedure step by step, but by the time we started giving the exam,

                              When Miss Rea observes the students taking the exam thus far, she notices

                       that everyone, except those who had latency, has opened their cameras, and she

                       reminds them of this. She kept an eye on the students' conversations to see if they

                       had any problems, as most of the students interact through chat.


                              I  discovered  a  lot  upon  giving  them  an  exam.  First,  I  found  out  that  if  the

                       person is not on the stage of the virtual class, you can’t hear him/her talking. That is

                       why you needed to drag the student profile to the center so that he/she could talk.

                              After the examination, Miss Rea and I talk about some adjustments that are

                       needed,  especially  the  time  for  the  students  upon  taking  the  exam,  and  some

                       clarifications and instruction that are needed to be settled.

                              I will be the one giving them an exam. Every time we have a moment like this,


                       one-on-one talk is a big help for extra learning because we can settle any lapses and

                       we become aware of what to do and what not to do next. Then I proceed to make my

                       module, which is grades 7 and 8 quarter 2 weeks 1 and 2, because today is the last

                       day of passing it. So far, I've sent it to Miss Rea for review at about 6 p.m.

                              I finished the day with a ton of new information and skills, and I'm grateful to


                       all the individuals who helped me along the way, especially my cooperating teacher,

                       who  is  always  eager  to  lend  a  helping  hand  when  I  have  questions  or  need

                       explanations.















                                                               23]]></page><page Index="271"><![CDATA[Day 14:  22 October 2021

                               Since today is the last day for assessments, I only attended 2 classes with

                       Ms. Rea: one for the Math 8 Genesis and one for the Science Grade 9 Samuel class.

                       Upon observing them through the video gallery, there is a student that doesn’t open


                       the camera, which is why Ms. Rea consistently asks them to open it.

                              When  I  look  at  the  students'  grades,  I  notice  that  most  of  them  pass,  but

                       almost three students do not. I ask Ms. Rea what will happen to the kids who do not

                       pass, and she says that they will have to repeat the exam. She must create a new

                       set  of  examinations  for  the  re-takers.  I  share  what  I  sometimes  learned  from  my


                       previous teacher. When there were students who didn’t excel in the written exam, we

                       were once advised to let the students do the practical test. Sometimes, even though

                       you  let  them  take  the  exam,  they  still  won’t  excel,  so  on  finding  the  students'

                       strengths and weaknesses, we allow them to explore different areas where they can

                       excel in some time. But of course, the teacher knows best, and I believed in Miss

                       Rea’s  way  of  handling  the  students'  strengths  and  weaknesses.  She  has  her  own

                       strategy  and  approach  that  she  has  already  developed  over  the  course  of  her


                       teaching experience. Different teachers have different approaches depending on the

                       students’ needs if we are helping and guiding the students to discover their skills and

                       potential that can be applied in their future careers.

                              As the week of observation progressed, I gained a lot of knowledge and had a

                       lot of learning opportunities. This week may end, but a new door is about to open,


                       and  a  new  path  is  about  to  be  walked  on.  A  new  opportunity  is  beckoning  to  be

                       seized, to be exploited in motivating the next generation of learners and contributing

                       to the development of aspiring learners' latent potential.















                                                               24]]></page><page Index="272"><![CDATA[Day 15:  25 October 2021

                              Today  I  went to two  classes,  one for  grade  7  Sarah  and  one for  grade  10

                       Psalms. I was supposed to attend Ms. Clarisse's math class at 2:00 p.m., but I didn't


                       since  I  had  an  initial  demo  teaching  appointment  with  Ms.  Rea. for  I  would  be

                       delivering  the  Grade  8  Genesis  and  Grade  7  Sarah  lessons  tomorrow.  My

                       cooperating instructor wants to see how I'll present my material. We got started at

                       about 2:45 p.m. since she had an important meeting to attend first. We get to about

                       3:30 p.m., and her opinion on my initial presentation is that my pronunciation must be


                       improved, which I can't refute because it is one of my weaknesses. It's already a part

                       of my Cebuano heritage. I can't tell you how many YouTube tutorials I've watched to

                       address this flaw, yet I still pronounce words differently without even realizing it. Her

                       second  remark  was  that  some  portions  of  the  activity  instruction  needed  to  be

                       rewritten to make it more clear to the children. The others were already fine, and I'm

                       hopeful  that  as  my  professional  growth  progresses,  those  shortcomings  I'm  facing

                       will become my strengths.


                              Today, Ms. Rea took a different approach to teaching. In mathematics, she

                       employs more captivating graphics that improve and emphasize the material more,

                       whether it's a topic about measurement in mathematics or themes linked to waves in

                       her science lesson. This reminds me that I should always consider sharing genuine

                       photographs to help students connect with reality.


                              My experience today serves as a reminder that when it comes to presenting

                       material,  it's  always  best  to  start  with  the  basics.  Because  it  is  simpler  for  your

                       learner to connect their fundamental learning to sophisticated challenges, it is easier

                       for them to relate what we are talking about at the same time with the instructor in

                       transferring knowledge.









                                                               25]]></page><page Index="273"><![CDATA[Day 16:  26 October 2021

                              Today, I went to three classes: Grade 8 Genesis, Grade 7 Sarah, and Grade

                       9 David. When I'm preparing for the first session, I'm excited and a little worried at

                       the same time, but when it's almost time to enter, there's a power outage, and my


                       nervousness  shoots  up.  I  quickly  apologized  to  my  cooperating  teacher  for  the

                       disruption, but thanks to God, I was able to enter the room at exactly 8:00 a.m. I relax

                       because  I  know  I'm  ready  and  I  know  in  my  heart  that  I've  been  waiting  for  this

                       moment for a long time. So, I began my class with a prayer, followed by a check of

                       attendance, a warm-up exercise, and then a discussion of the prior topic, which was


                       measurement. I present the lesson by enabling the students to read the information.

                       In  the  same  way,  as  my  cooperating  teacher  does,  I  award  them  every  time  they

                       participate. So far, they've done a great job with all the activities, and I like how they

                       accepted  me.  I  observe  that  compared  to  Miss Clarise's  practice  teaching

                       students, the students are so quiet that they don't raise their hands. I think the reason

                       for this is the difficulty of the topic. It's merely a thought about why they're hesitant to

                       raise their hands.


                              For  the  second  class,  after  praying,  verifying  attendance,  and  recalling  the

                       topic, I used breakrooms for grouping Genesis students. This section of the class is

                       something  I'd  want  to  explore.  When  we  get  there,  we  run  into  a  few  issues.  For

                       example, when the students are writing at the table for their activity, their answers will

                       be lost if the PowerPoint is moved. So, to maintain their activity, they must capture a


                       screenshot  before  responding.  So  far,  with  regards  to  the  grade  8  students,  they

                       were all kind and they participated well.

                              Today's learning experience was great; I love the sense of teaching; I love the

                       grins  of  the  young  children  who  reacted  when  you  praised  them  after  they  gave

                       accurate responses in moments of participation; I also enjoy the racing of hands as

                       they  waited  to  be  called.  I  know  deep  down  in my  heart  that this  is  a  passion  for

                       transmitting and shaping information to young minds.



                                                               26]]></page><page Index="274"><![CDATA[Day 17:  27 October 2021

                              I  only  went  to  one  lesson  today,  grade  8  Genesis.  Then  I  went  back  to

                       working on a pending lesson plan that was to be presented by Friday. I arrived at

                       7:50 a.m. At 8:00 a.m., I began with prayer and a check of attendance. as well as


                       remembering the prior lesson. I continued the linear inequality topic and then asked

                       them  a  question  to  ponder.  I'm  still  apprehensive  since  I've  just  recently  begun  to

                       form a relationship with them. I want to be brave, but I think I need a little more time

                       to create a comfortable environment; I feel like they aren't yet comfortable with me,

                       but despite that, they are eager to participate, which I appreciate. Ms. Rea provided


                       feedback  on  my  performance  after  class,  stating  that  I  have  a  loud  voice  and

                       observing that this may be because I do not use the headset. I removed my headset

                       due  to  the  lack  of  a  USB  connection  on  my  laptop.  The  three  available  ports  are

                       utilized for the webcam, mouse, and pen and pad, but I assure Ms. Rea that I have

                       already purchased an additional port. His second remark is that I am too serious; I

                       want to improve on that, and I hope that God provides me with humor, particularly

                       because mathematics sometimes makes students unable to smile. Her third remark


                       was  about  the  students'  names;  some  students  prefer  not  to  be  acknowledged  by

                       their full names, so she suggested I use their nicknames or the ones with which their

                       peers were familiar. Finally, she assured me that the rest is OK, particularly the way I

                       assign activities to the students. Because I allow all the participants to engage, it is

                       incredibly participatory. As per Mis Rea's comment, I have managed the tasks she


                       has not yet accomplished.

                              Today's learning experience has taught me that it is a difficult day, perhaps

                       because the grade 8 students' topic is a little difficult and they barely keep up with the

                       discussion, perhaps because the topic is new to them. Since mathematics is naturally

                       challenging for learners when they first encounter a new topic, we must be allowed

                       the time to process their learning.

                              Today, I just have one class, Sarah, in Grade 7. I entered the virtual room at

                       7:50 a.m. and waited for others to join. While waiting for the others, I welcomed them.

                       At exactly 8:00 a.m., we began with a prayer, followed by a check of attendance, and


                       then a recap of the preceding topic.

                              So  far,  our  conversation  has  gone  well.  I  utilized  question  and  answer  to

                       ponder the kids' learning and if they were grasping the subject, and I also employed

                       grouping through break rooms since it gave everyone a chance to engage. Everyone

                       had  the  opportunity  to  be  rewarded.  It  is  the  most  effective  approach  for  me  to


                       recognize each student's potential and help them realize their capabilities. I'd want to

                       put  these  strategies  into  practice  because  they  can  help  people  gain  confidence.

                       Since I encouraged them to allow their members to participate after they presented

                       their work, each member of the group earned an award, and it is satisfying to see

                       that everyone benefits from their efforts.

                              Since this is the last day for the topic, I just encountered an almost 3-minute

                       delay in their time. This is one of the challenges we face when doing the activity in


                       groups because we let the students do the work; as far as I can tell, they are just

                       using the text button to display their answers, but I am happy because they try their

                       hardest and do an excellent job, and they then participate very well.

                              Today's session reminded me that it impacts the feelings of one person when

                       they want to be recognized, but the opportunity was less so through the groups. As


                       they are recognized, they feel deserving of the award that their peers have always

                       received. I'm sure they're happy as they walk away from a virtual lesson. They are

                       pleased with their achievements.

                               We don't have lessons today because our school is participating in a mental

                       health awareness webinar called "magpahinga." It is yet another gift to educate and

                       realize the importance of instructors', employees', and students' mental health. We


                       must educate the public, particularly during this pandemic, that practically everyone

                       has  distinct  obstacles  and  that  their  mental  health  is  in  jeopardy.  As  it  has  been

                       mentioned,  sleep  is  not  enough  to  recharge  and  rejuvenate  us;  there  are  other

                       methods to deal with it to alleviate the load that everyone is carrying. As it has always

                       been  said,  taking  time  to  relax  and  unwind  is  not  a  sin.  This  webinar  is  quite


                       beneficial in revealing those strategies so that we can withstand  all the aches that

                       everyone goes through.

                              I learned about the six psychological well-beings shared by the speaker of the

                       webinar,  Mr.  Lemuel  Gallego,  which  is  self-acceptance.  We  must  learn  to  accept

                       ourselves and have a positive attitude toward who we are. The second is positive

                       relations.  We  must  build  a  warm,  trusting,  and  satisfying  relationship  with  others.

                       Third,  autonomy  means  we  are  independent  and  can  resist  social  pressure.  The


                       fourth is environmental mastery. We can manage our environment and maximize our

                       opportunities. The fifth is the purpose in life. We strive to have meaning in our lives

                       by setting goals.

                              I also learned that we must extend more patience and understanding to those

                       students who live in silence, because we never know what they have been through.


                       During the webinar, I understood that everyone has a unique story to tell, but we all

                       need to be strong in all aspects of our lives. We must learn to enjoy the little things in

                       life since life is brief, and anything may happen at any time. Giving treasure to your

                       family  also  teaches  me  that  there  is  always  someone  willing  to  listen.  Sir  Michael

                       Aquino’s words, "The pain is there, but you must move forward," have also struck

                       me.






                                                               29]]></page><page Index="277"><![CDATA[Day 20:  03 November 2021

                              During  my  class  for  grade  8  Genesis, I  continue  the  last  discussion.

                       Sometimes  the  students  speak  out  about  their  trouble  when  it  is  hard  for  them  to


                       understand the part of the content. I appreciate how individuals reply, whether they

                       understand  the  material  or  need  more  information.  I  constantly  commended  them,

                       especially when they expressed worry; it's one of the best methods to determine if

                       you should proceed or provide extra details. They are quite active in participating, yet

                       there are occasions when students are unable to answer when allowed to be called


                       upon. In these cases, you will just believe that they are experiencing lagging. I hope

                       that as this situation continues, we see changes such as a good internet connection,

                       so that no one is left behind and that everyone can speak up for their growth and

                       advancement.

                              For  my  worry  in  teaching,  I  need  to  improve  my  time  management  skills

                       because today I finished my class more than a minute longer, but I am more time-

                       aware now than I was on the first day of class, albeit not flawlessly.


                              Today's  insight,  after  completing  many  paper  tasks,  is  that  when  our

                       commitment to the task fills our thoughts, we will be triumphant, and no obstacles will

                       be able to stop us from pursuing our goal. We shall accomplish things beyond our

                       wildest dreams, with the support of our creator, who provides us with the strength

                       and wisdom that is needed to finish the work that has been assigned and entrusted


                       to us. The most essential thing we can do is acknowledge and be eternally grateful

                       for our accomplishment, which is awed from above. When we rely on our ability, we

                       are nothing. The completed work is a gift from God. Even if you are going through

                       difficulties  created  by  uncontrollable  circumstances,  you  are  still  shining  and

                       becoming an inspiration. I hope and pray that everyone who is working hard may be

                       blessed  with  a  pearl  of  knowledge  and  a  sound  plan  to  help  them  succeed  in

                       whatever task they are responsible for.

                              I teach grade 7. Sarah, I saw an improvement in the class time-end since I

                       dismissed  my  class  at exactly  8:55  without my  cooperating teacher's  signal,  and I

                       think I've perfected being time-aware because it's essential for the students not to be


                       late  for  their  next  class  as  well.  Despite  evaluating  how  I  delivered  the  lecture;  I

                       discovered a few typos in my PowerPoint. I'd want to see the issue addressed, and

                       I'm hoping that by being extra cautious with my materials, I'll be able to do it. I want to

                       improve in this matter.

                              So  far,  just  a  few  students  have  cooperated  on  my  question-and-answer


                       portion of the lesson, possibly because I only show a few opportunities for everyone

                       to answer a question, I don't do the groupings today at the same time, and only a few

                       activities are given because it is more on-topic discussion due to the long weekend

                       vacation.

                              For  today's  realization,  even  if  you  are  doing  your  absolute  best,  you  will

                       occasionally feel guilty. This guilt comes out of nowhere and you have no idea where

                       it came from. All you must do now is pray and seek God's guidance so that you may


                       build wisdom to deal with a situation and sprinkle what is needed and vital action for

                       the  benefit  of  the  students.  I'm  hoping  to  figure  out  a  way  to  provide  every  single

                       student an equal chance and equal attention at the same time. Because I feel guilty

                       when I see approximately five children answering questions over and over while the

                       other nearly twenty students are just silently listening to me. I want to communicate


                       with them; I want to hear a word from them; and this emotion concerns me a lot. It

                       makes me wonder what I could do to hear their voices as well, so that they do not

                       become  silent  students.  I'm  hoping  that  as  time  passes  and  my  professional

                       development progresses, I'll be able to overcome this and find a solution.









                                                               31]]></page><page Index="279"><![CDATA[Day 22:  05 November 2021

                              I just taught one class today, grade 8 Genesis, and I also observed one class,

                       grade 10 David, with Miss Clarrise.

                              In grades 8 through 12, So far, the same character has emerged: they are


                       highly engaged, they ask questions when they don't understand, but I can't deny that

                       some students prefer to remain quiet. Even though you encouraged them to open,

                       they remained off-camera. However, there is a consideration for students who have

                       connection issues. That is one of the obstacles that a teacher must confront, and I

                       hope  that  one  day  I  will  be  able to  provide  a  way for  them to  be  heard.  The  best


                       solution  I  came  up  with  to  address  this  issue  is  groupings,  which  entails  breaking

                       them up into smaller groups so that they can present themselves. I'm delighted to

                       see various students flourish in participation; not just 5 to 10 faces who are active,

                       but everyone is racing to be heard.

                              Even though I am uneasy because of unmet goals, I must continue to dream,

                       to bring up the wants and hopes of the passion, because you never know how much

                       our creator understands what is deep down in our hearts, and perhaps one of these


                       days he will provide an opportunity for you so the desire will be put into action and

                       be heard  by the people or  students  around  us. Never  give  up  on  your aspirations,

                       never  give  up  on  your passion,  because  those  are the  things  that  will  lead  you  to

                       success. Always remember that God placed you in that position, with that authority

                       and responsibility, because he has a plan for you that is greater than any plan you


                       have ever had. Those who wished for good things were given excellent things. Those

                       who wish for success will get it.

                                I entered my class around 7:50 in the morning with grade 7 Sarah. The topic

                       I prepared is an algebraic expression. Since it's Monday and I haven't seen them in a


                       long time, I attempt to ask them how their weekend was, but I'm ashamed since just

                       one student responds. Fortunately, there is one for the preceding days when no one

                       responds, it's an unsettling sensation when you're trying your hardest to make them

                       feel  at  ease  with  you,  but  they  don't  seem  to  be  ready  yet.  I  also  go  to  Miss.

                       Clarisse's class in Grade 9 David today, but Sir Ivan, an ST student from the Silang


                       CvSU campus, has taken over. At the same time, I sent Ms. Rea my updated lesson

                       plan, which I had started working on over the weekend. During my class, I start with

                       prayer, then verify attendance (some students arrive early, some late), and then go

                       through the previous topic again. After presenting the lecture, I called on the student

                       who raised their hand to read the important content on my PowerPoint. When no one

                       raises their hands, I just direct the students to respond, but this is a rare occurrence

                       because my learners have always been quite engaged, especially when allowed to


                       share their thoughts. Today's experience and approach have left me happy since I

                       believe  all  students  engaged  well  virtually,  except  for  some  who  I  have  contacted

                       several times but have had no answer, maybe because communication is difficult for

                       them, which I understand. I completed my discussion on my own with a precise time;

                       I'm becoming better at keeping track of time, and I enjoy it.


                              My realization during this encounter was that I saw how addictive your mind

                       becomes when it is already designed to teach. It's as if you want to teach all the time.

                       This sensation excites you to the point that, even if you are already on your way to

                       relaxation, your heart and mind yearn to accomplish more. I pray that this emotion

                       will remain longer, that it will be ingrained in my heart so that I will constantly look for

                       opportunities to teach others.





                                                               33]]></page><page Index="281"><![CDATA[Day 24:  09 November 2021

                              Today I  teach two classes:  grade  7  Sarah  and grade  8 Math.  At the  same

                       time, I am working on my module for weeks 5 and 6. I'm trying my hardest to plan so

                       that I don't have cramps anytime soon, especially because I have a lot of time on my


                       hands right now.

                              As I teach my grade 7 Sarah, I had the idea that if I chose five students who

                       participated  well  each  day  to  announce  congratulatory  praise,  it  would  encourage

                       others who are just silently listening to me to raise their hands because, as I have

                       observed,  even  the  students  who  are  not  actively  participating  know  the  answer


                       when called. They know how to do it, yet they seem to prefer silence. I'm not sure

                       whether  that's  a  good  plan,  but  I'm  hoping  I'll  be  able  to  accomplish  it  and  stay

                       motivated to do so in the long term.

                              So far, I've been almost ten minutes early for my classes. Then I go about my

                       daily routine as usual. I used to ask and answer questions during the lecture, and the

                       class has been attentive thus far. Most of them collaborated, and I'm nearly at a loss

                       for who to choose because virtually everyone is participating; I'm overwhelmed, and


                       I'm appreciative.

                              I get the idea that some of the students in my Genesis class are already at

                       ease  since  I  occasionally  see  grins  on  their  cheeks,  particularly  when  they  share,

                       which was previously casual, and that’s interesting.

                              My  realization  from  today's  experience  is  that  it  truly  takes  time  to  gather


                       yourself to be comfortable. We just need to wait for that perfect time. We must be

                       patient  with  every  new  experience  we  encounter.  The  unusual  feeling  will  not  last

                       forever; it will end soon, and sooner it will be replaced with a great experience that

                       surely remains in everyone's heart.

                              I teach only one class today, which is grade eight Genesis. I follow the usual

                       routine  like  prayer,  attendance  checking,  and  recalling  the  previous  topic,  then

                       proceed with the activity as a pre-assessment regarding my topic, and finally present


                       my  lesson  using  the  PowerPoint.  After  I  gave  my  presentation,  I  let  my  students

                       navigate  the  topic  by  asking  them  questions  and  enabling  them  to  participate  in

                       various  activities.  Some  individuals  also  ask  questions  when  they  don't  grasp

                       something, which I enjoy since it allows me to analyze how they can improve their

                       understanding.


                              As  far  as  I can  tell, my  students  are  becoming  more  open  to  one  another.

                       Individuals  now  talk  about their  events  as  I  engage  in  their "kamustahan,"  which  I

                       love. After my presentation, I delegated the group exercise to the students. I divided

                       them into four groups so that nearly all the students could participate effectively, and

                       they would be presented at the next meeting on Friday.

                              I congratulated the top three who were compensated for their participation, as

                       I  had  intended,  but  I  also  encouraged  everyone  to  bring  their  ideas  because  I


                       believed anybody could participate well.

                              My takeaway from today's lecture is that time truly does allow us to cope with

                       the anxiety we experience. All we need now is more time to comprehend it and the

                       right  moment  to  accept  it.  Continue  to  look  on  the  bright  side  since  everyone  is

                       having a great time dealing freely, which will naturally show in everyone's personality.


                       Simply learn to value every moment and do your best to enjoy every single action

                       taken by anyone through it. This will serve as a step to open a new window of a good

                       relationship and respect.

                              I  started  my  class  with  grade  7  today  at  around  7:50  in  the  morning.  The

                       grade  7  students  are  yet  very  comfortable  with  me.  They  don’t  show  any  sign  of

                       comfort when I am the one teaching, compared with Miss Rea's class before. They


                       sometimes share funny ideas, which are very helpful for the class to be lively. We

                       just  perform  casual  teaching  and  seldom  grin;  it's  merely  a  teaching  and  learning

                       procedure. I also want the students to feel at ease with me. I'm waiting for the right

                       moment  to  experience  that  with  the  grade  7  class.  In  terms  of  my  teaching,  the

                       process has been participatory because, even if they are not particularly comfortable,


                       they know how to push those feelings aside and simply enjoy the learning process.

                       Then, as I had planned in my earlier days, I congratulated them on receiving the top

                       trophy earner. I believe it is useful since practically everyone is attempting to raise

                       their hands. I hope that everyone will participate and that no one will just sit there

                       silently observing and listening until the conversation period is through. I want them

                       to provide a sense of belonging to the group, that they are a part of it, and that they

                       may freely express their opinions, whether they are accurate or not. Because I feel


                       that if kids are taught to voice their thoughts as soon as possible, they will be more

                       confident in themselves.

                              Today, I utilized group activities to evaluate what they've learned. There are

                       four groups, and I feel that assessing them in this way will allow me to analyze them

                       not  just  in  terms  of  comprehending  the  topic  but  also  in  terms  of  discovering  the


                       students' leadership potential. Because, in my experience with these groups, some

                       students are adamant about not becoming a leader. Developing leadership skills is

                       an  important  step  in  students'  future  careers  since  it  allows  them  to  achieve  their

                       goals. Their capabilities would be shown.

                              My current realization is that it is extremely beneficial to provide students with

                       various learning strategies because, in the long run, you are developing not only their

                       intellect but also their ability to handle a situation or their emotions, particularly when



                                                               36]]></page><page Index="284"><![CDATA[they  are  appointed  to  lead,  as  well  as  their  skills  in  standing  when  they  are

                       heart that I did a wonderful job preparing my students to take on the duties when they

                       are selected.




                       Day 27:  12 November 2021

                              Today  I  handle  one  class,  which  is  grade  8  Genesis.  At  the  same  time,  I

                       observe grade 9, David. During my spare time, I am doing my 2 modules, which are

                       scheduled for Q2 weeks 5 and 6.


                              In  class,  the  students  will  just  submit  their  performance  work  on  linear

                       functions, which will be completed after the prayer and attendance check. I will not

                       have  a  subject  discussion  today  because  the  entire  week's  topic  is  practically

                       complete.  At  the  previous  meeting,  the  students  were  assigned  a  group  job  to

                       complete, which will be delivered today. Before the students presented their work, I

                       went  through  the  rubrics  with  them  since  they  needed  to  grasp  the  rubrics  to

                       understand how they are graded and to be able to evaluate the students consistently.


                       The  rubrics  assist  the  instructor  in  providing  accurate  and  fair  grading  while  also

                       assisting  the  student  in  achieving  excellence  in  their  assignment.  Collaboration  is

                       also a fantastic method for reducing their academic problems, since I feel that not all

                       pupils  are  gifted  enough  to  master  every  mathematics  topic  step  by  step.  So  far,

                       everyone in the grade 8 class has done an amazing job, and I've seen that they have


                       outstanding collaboration and leadership skills, which is a necessary basis for them

                       to succeed in a real-world scenario. I feel this is an excellent skill to cultivate since

                       effective cooperation and leadership have a significant impact on the success of any

                       profession.  Since  not  all  the  time  we  encounter  a  perfect  moment,  I'm  further

                       ashamed today, since the kids were required to give a little cheer introduction before

                       beginning  their  presentation,  which  served  as  an  ice  breaker.  Then  they  chose  a






                                                               37]]></page><page Index="285"><![CDATA[joke, but it didn't register in my thoughts correctly, so I did not react; seriously, when

                       but  also  by  considering  and  allowing  them  to  demonstrate  not  only  individual

                       character toward their peers, and how they shared all their responsibilities with their

                       peers.



                       Day 28:  15 November 2021


                              I have 1 class today, Grade 7. Sarah, I received a significant announcement

                       that the monthly assessment is approaching. Therefore, I've been assigned the task

                       of preparing a 25-item exam for grades 7 and 8, with a 4-week course covering it, at

                       the  same  time  conducting  a  short  quiz  for  the  students  before  the  assessment

                       comes. I just prepared a 10-item exam for the brief quiz that will serve as a review.

                       I supply feedback on my teaching performance; thus far, she has given me favorable

                       comments, such as that I am a very independent person who can stand in my class.


                       It serves as an excellent reminder to keep your passion alive in your heart.

                       Even though my class today was on a topic that was a little bit complicated,

                       But  they  still  tried  their  hardest  to  keep  up.  Students  quickly  grasped  the  new,

                       complex topic, while others struggled, which is understandable, especially since the

                       material is new to them. All we must do now is double our patience. It's all part of the


                       learning  and  teaching  process.  So  far,  the  lesson  has  ended  with  strong  student

                       engagement.

                              My revelation today is that there is a perfect time to appreciate every struggle

                       you invested in your passion and aspirations. You may believe that no one notices

                       your labor or that you have been forgotten. You may believe that your efforts were

                       unappreciated, yet all of that was simply in the back of your mind, waiting for God's

                       ideal moment to allow you to be acknowledged. Your work will influence the lives of



                                                               38]]></page><page Index="286"><![CDATA[others. You supplied success to others around you  because of your perseverance

                       Day 29:  16 November 2021

                              Today I have two classes: grade 7 and grade 8. I'm also continuing to work

                       on my Grade 8 module. I conduct extensive studies so that my students can manage

                       the parts that are difficult to understand.


                              I  have  challenges  in  my  grade  7  discussion  since  it  is  a  problem-solving

                       activity that requires the students to look up to their performance, but the students

                       have a tough time showing their answers. because they're only utilizing text as input.

                       I hope that one of these days, students will not only use text to show solutions or the

                       mouse to write, especially with exponents, on the virtual board but will instead use an

                       electronic pen and pad to experience convenience in learning, particularly in solving

                       problems and showing up their mathematics solutions. I think students will just solve


                       it in their notebooks, but it is essential to show their work to their classmates, how

                       they do it, and how they spend the time in a meaningful way since this is an add-on

                       for other students' learning. When one student learns from the other students, there

                       will be learning cooperation. It is not always possible for all students to absorb the

                       professors'  methods,  but  it  is  also  important  that  they  learn  from  their  classmates'


                       methods and strategies so that it is easier for them to grasp. because I feel that a

                       student's  level  of  comprehension  does  not  always  correspond  to  how  a  teacher

                       perceives  a  topic.  They  can  learn  from  one  another  through  peer  teaching,  which

                       involves  seeing  their  peers'  learning  styles  and  levels  of  comprehension,  and  I

                       discovered that in my grade 8 class. When a student asks me what she finds tough, I

                       try to figure out the best technique and approach. So, to address that problem, I had

                       other students who understood my technique express how they understood it, which



                                                               39]]></page><page Index="287"><![CDATA[was quite useful since it proved that they applied their improved method to alleviate

                              Today,  I  discovered  that  students  require  more  attention,  and  those

                       individuals are putting a strain on our hearts. As a teacher, you strive to ensure that


                       everyone  receives  equal  attention,  but  I  can't  deny  that there  are times when  you

                       have the feeling that one of the students’ needs special attention from you to help

                       them bring out the best in them. If you don't address this, it's as if you are missing a

                       point in your life where you can make an impact and make changes so that these

                       students can reach their full potential.




                       Day 30:  17 November 2021

                              Today  I  just  have  one  class,  Grade  8  Genesis.  After  the  usual  routine  of

                       prayer,  attendance  checking,  and  recall,  I  diligently  check  the  students'  earlier

                       participation performance. I am overwhelmed with their cooperation because almost

                       all of them were doing an excellent job of participating, except for those who had an

                       unstable connection. That makes me pleased, and I hope and pray that I can come


                       up with more things for them to help them realize their full potential and confidence.

                       At the same time, I finished my Grade 7 module today and handed it to Ms. Rea at

                       the end of the day.

                              After a smooth ending to the discussion, I reminded them to be ready for their

                       short quiz on Friday. Their quiz is extremely crucial for students to prepare for their


                       next monthly assessment. It will function as a pre-review, easing the pressure of full-

                       load studying.

                              On this day of learning, I realized that everyone needs drive and inspiration.

                       When you see someone going through a tough time, be there for them, be a part of

                       their lives, offer comfort, reach out, and be their guiding light. Our availability to them

                       aided their development, and our desire to guide them has been greatly beneficial in

                       encouraging them. I believe that even if you only see your students from afar or in



                                                               40]]></page><page Index="288"><![CDATA[the back of the monitor, you can see deep down in their hearts that they tried their

                       successful.




                       Day 31:  18 November 2021

                              My class today is in grade 7, Sarah. There is no discussion today. I have only

                       prepared a ten-item quiz to help them prepare for their forthcoming grade 7 monthly

                       exam.


                              I  saw  that  practically  everyone  opened  their  camera  throughout  their  quiz,

                       which  made  me  delighted.  I  presented  it  using  PowerPoint.  However,  one  of  the

                       challenges of using PowerPoint is that the students' response times to quizzes are

                       not the same. The kids respond quickly, while others do not. I did, however, upload a

                       backup copy of their class assignment so that certain students could complete it at

                       their own pace. The students completed the quiz before the time limit was reached,

                       while  others  did  not.  I  simply  give  them  a  reminder  that  it  is  beneficial  for  their


                       evaluation  since  it  will  function  as  a review to help  them  prepare  for  their monthly

                       assessment.

                              After  my  class,  I  check  the  quizzes  of  the  students.  So  far,  students  have

                       received flawless responses and a passing grade, while others have received a lower

                       rating. It is understandable that not all children are capable, but I am providing them


                       with the opportunity to rectify their replies.

                       A teacher’s job is to raise and aid them, create opportunities, and, most importantly,

                       push them on when they feel behind. Regardless of their background, everyone has

                       an  opportunity  to  succeed.  Our  guidance  and  consideration  are  relevant  to  their

                       academic  growth.  I  believed  that  no  matter  how  hard  your  students  experienced

                       today, there was always a chance. They can excel in diverse ways. It may be hard

                       for them to excel in numbers, but not all the time they are facing that hardship. Life is

                       Day 32:  19 November 2021


                              My  Genesis  Grade  8  class  was  supposed  to  be  today.  However,  it  was

                       canceled due to a TFUCS faculty briefing and a medical emergency. Since the quiz

                       was planned for today, I simply added the quiz to the task for them to complete, as it

                       was  an  announced  quiz.  We  must  conduct  a  quiz  if  it  is  announced  because  the

                       students' efforts are more valuable. I recall a time when our instructor announced a


                       quiz, and it was so frustrating when it didn't happen since you had spent so much

                       time preparing for that quiz, and then it was eventually canceled. You spent the time

                       and effort, and I'm sure you didn't go to bed early for that quiz, so I value it. I also

                       went to Ms. Clarrise's class, but it was Mr. Mark, a student-teacher, who took over.

                       His  method  is  more  activity-based,  allowing  students  to  display  their  work.  I  also

                       inputted my 25-item test for the grade 7 and grade 8 students in the class. It's my first

                       time submitting a question. I discovered minor issues, such as question numbering


                       and placement, which are critical because it will be difficult to find the correct answer

                       if you are not paying attention. However, with a little more time spent exploring the

                       inputting process, the difficulties I discovered became manageable

                              My insight is that we will learn if we allow ourselves to explore. We reached

                       the  progress  that  we  deserved  when  we  refused  to  limit  ourselves  to  the  fresh


                       opportunity of information that was knocking on our development. I am also reminded

                       that the word that comes out of our lips has an impact on every person who hears it,

                       and even on the younger generation who look up to and trust every word we utter.

                       There are instances when uncontrolled situations take over our plans but striving to

                       push through the plans, we have is something of an add-on so that the trust will be

                       kept.





                                                               42]]></page><page Index="290"><![CDATA[Day 33:  22 November 2021

                              Today is the first day of assessment for Grade 7, which begins at 8:00 a.m.

                       After I complete the routine, I try to return to the test settings, but I am unable to do

                       so  because  when  I  click  the  confirm  button,  all  my  questions  appear  one  by  one,


                       causing me to panic. After all, I assumed the test question I created the day before

                       had  not  been  processed  into  a  test  paper.  This  is  my  first-time  uploading  test

                       questions to Classin, so I was unsure of what to do next. I saw that I had to complete

                       the  questionnaires  one  by  one,  but  the  students'  time  was  running  out.  They  only

                       have one hour for the test, and if I caused them to be late, it would affect their other


                       exam, which is scheduled after this time. So, even though I'm embarrassed by my

                       cooperating teacher for the unfinished assignment, I decide to inform her that I won't

                       be able to complete it, so I exit the account and let her take over the uncertainties.

                       Fortunately, she managed it well, and the exam schedule was adhered to.

                       I was affected by what had happened, but Ms. Reah explains to me that I might have

                       missed  clicking  the  select  button  part  of  the  setting,  which  is  why  the  test  paper

                       doesn’t appear. She said that I took the test correctly.


                              Today, I'm experiencing overconfidence in my ability to do the task. I didn't

                       double-check  the  procedure  since,  in  my  mind,  I  had  already  completed  it  and

                       assumed that I could do it again. It is a mistaken perspective since it was previously

                       taught a month ago and we tend to forget about it, especially when it is not performed

                       often in the process. I'm unhappy about it, but learning isn't always a bed of roses,


                       and we occasionally have experiences like this to remind us that we must constantly

                       be alert and double-check our allotted work.

                              Today I discovered that our work does not always reflect who we aspire to be.

                       There are events that will inevitably distract us, and this is beyond our control. What

                       matters is how we respond to it and how we deal with it so that the issue does not

                       affect  everyone.  Then  always  call  for  help.  Requesting  aid  will  decrease  the

                       challenges of the scenario we find ourselves in.



                                                               43]]></page><page Index="291"><![CDATA[Day 34:  23 November 2021

                              Today is the second day of the students' monthly assessment, and because I

                       don't have a schedule for Miss Rea, I just go to Miss Clarries' class, where Sir Mark,


                       one  of the  ST  students,  handled  it.  He  is  the  one  who  assigns the  grade  9  David

                       students'  assessment.  So  far,  everything  has  gone  smoothly.  While  the  students

                       were  taking  the  test,  they  opened  their  cameras.  The  pupils  demanded  a  "bunos"

                       question,  which  Sir  Mark  agreed  to  provide.  Giving  them  a  bonus  question  is

                       beneficial  in  mathematics  since  it  allows  them  to  cover  the  area  where  they  are


                       missing  anything.  I  also  recall  that  during  my  assessment,  I  gave  my  students  a

                       bonus  question,  which  helped  students  cover  up  the  areas  where  they  made

                       mistakes.

                              When I observed Sir Mark's task, I noticed that they have different styles in

                       giving the test paper because, in his test paper, you'll see a word next in the bottom

                       part of the test paper, and when I press the next button, it shows the sent message,

                       and there's a textbox where you can type a message; it's different in how we make


                       the  exam  because,  in  my  way  of  giving  exams,  when  you  present  the  test,  it

                       automatically shows all questions.

                       I'm hesitant to inquire why since I don't want to interrupt the students who are taking

                       the exam.

                              My realization is that nothing is impossible when you are willing to learn and


                       ready to explore. Every time we go out of our comfort zone, surely there will be a

                       bunch of innovative ideas that we will be learning and buying.

                              Today  is  grade  8  students'  assessment  day.  The  latency  in  the  connection

                       interrupts my preparation to enter 15 minutes before the time. I'm scared because it

                       takes over 15 minutes to attempt. I sent a text message to my cooperating teacher


                       informing  her  that  my  present  connection  was  insufficient  to  complete  the

                       assessment. I was worried that the day would be awful again, but happily, around 8

                       a.m.,  I  was  able  to  join  the  virtual  room.  I  automatically  begin  the  process  of

                       administering  the  exam  to  the  pupils.  I've  previously  gone  through  the  entire

                       procedure  since  I  don't  want  to  repeat  what  happened  in  my  grade  7  class  last


                       Monday.  I've  been  effective  in  assessing  the  students,  and  I'm  pleased  with  the

                       outcome.

                              In the video gallery, I keep a careful eye on the students while they take the

                       exam. So far, everything has been done in full view and quietly.

                       For one student who doesn’t take an exam for an important reason, my cooperating

                       teacher told me that they will take it some other time.

                       The  session  went  off  without  a  hitch,  and the  students  completed the  assessment


                       before the time limit ended.

                       Due  to  a  last-minute  change  in  the  class  activity,  I  also  created  a  PowerPoint  for

                       Grade 7. I expected that tomorrow would be an online seminar day and that there

                       would  be  no  classes,  but  my  cooperating teacher  informs  me  that  there  will  be  a

                       class tomorrow, so I need to finish my PowerPoint. Fortunately, I finished it before it


                       became dark.

                              The lesson I learned today is that if we are well prepared before the start of

                       time, the responsibilities will go smoothly. To prevent making mistakes overall, never

                       be  overconfident.  If  you  fail  eventually  despite  your  best  efforts,  accept  it  since

                       certain  things  in  life  are  beyond  our  control,  and  no  matter  how  prepared  we  are,

                       interruptions  can  create  a  distraction.  Always  pray  about  the  conditions  that  are

                       beyond our control. Everything will be well when God is present.



                                                               45]]></page><page Index="293"><![CDATA[Day 36:  25 November 2021

                              Today in my grade 7 class, I started with the normal greetings, attendance,

                       and prayer.  Before  I  begin  my  recollection  and  topic  discussion,  I'll  give  a  quick

                       overview  of  their  assessment  regarding  their  scores  and  bonus  points,  which  are


                       important since they can be added to a student's score if they submit a test paper

                       with a missing answer to one or more questions. So far, almost everyone is happy

                       with the score, except for the 2 students who failed to make it into a passing grade.

                       My  cooperating  teacher  mentioned  to  me  previously  that  the  students  who  didn’t

                       pass must retake another set of exams.


                              They continue to strive to convey their thoughts, particularly on the parts that

                       are difficult for them to understand, which is a cheerful outlook on the part of the kids

                       to alleviate the challenges they have met. We closed class with a new set of skills

                       that the kids were going to value and that would serve as an excellent basis for a

                       more difficult topic in the future.

                              I  also  attended  the  online  seminar  that  was  scheduled  to  begin  at  about  1

                       p.m.  that  afternoon.  However,  there  were  technical  difficulties.  Being  in  the  new


                       mode  of  learning  entails  all  of  this.  The  online  seminar  is  about  COVID-19  and

                       educational preparedness awareness and protection during the pandemic with Ms.

                       Althea Zaballa Mascarenas as a resource speaker. The online seminar is beneficial

                       in terms of preparing us for these times of uncertainty.

                              My revelation for the day was that in moments of doubt, educate yourself. Be


                       open to receiving essential lessons and recommendations that will help you alleviate

                       your problems. Worries don't assist you, instead the information does with the help of

                       those who are knowledgeable about our circumstances.

                              Today there is no meet-up with the students. I am doing paperwork. planning

                       and  searching  for  the  lesson  that  needs  to  be  taught  by  next  week,  which  is  the

                       module weeks 7 and 8 for grades 7 and grade 8. It takes much too long to merely link


                       each lesson to the next. I can't deny that I struggle with the activities that must be

                       presented  before  the  lesson  as  a  motivation  to  attract  the  students'  attention;

                       sometimes when you can't connect it from the start, the students may be confused.

                       However,  if  you  plan  it carefully, this  will  supply  an  opportunity for the students to

                       become active participants in the learning process. To fairly share the topic for the


                       whole week's discussion, you must carefully select which ideas to address. Some of

                       the mistakes I've made in building a module so far include sometimes you can't finish

                       the full  idea  for  a  week,  and  other  times there were  brief  concepts  that  you  could

                       accomplish in two days, but it was a fantastic opportunity since the students were

                       given time to complete the exercise.

                              My  current  realization  is  to  always  try  your  best,  be  resourceful,  and  be

                       extremely  careful  while  searching  for  information  since  ignoring  this  might  take


                       students  down  the  wrong  route.  Always  double-check  that  you're  on  a  trustworthy

                       website.  When  it  comes  to  constructing  modules,  I  always  prefer  DepEd  sites

                       because they are already well verified. I haven't had any misunderstandings thus far

                       while working on my module, which I am grateful for. The students can relate to it

                       quickly because of my meticulous planning. They have a greater understanding.

                              We don't have a class meeting today since the TFUCS faculty are attending

                       seminars, but my cooperating teacher has asked me to create a ten-item exam for


                       the grade 7 class, which is given to them from 8:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. I didn't check

                       my messenger the night before, so I didn't notice the message. I'm in a rush to finish

                       it  early  in  the  morning.  I  am  grateful  that  I  was  able  to  upload  it  on  time  after

                       producing it.

                              After  the  time  limit  ended,  I  discovered  that  approximately  ten  pupils  had


                       completed their work; others may not have responded yet. It is not surprising to me

                       because this is one of the problems teachers usually face, especially now that we are

                       in the current situation where uncontrollable connections occur. The only thing you

                       can do is to continue sending a notification to the students. Then I went through the

                       work of the students who had already gave their papers. So far, the results of the

                       students'  scores  were  amazing,  they  got  the  highest  score.  Then  I  spent  time

                       developing my module for weeks 7, and 8 for grades 7 and grade 8. I start it early


                       because sometimes it takes time to make because it needs research in organizing

                       the concepts and activities that you want to share with the students. So far, in making

                       modules, my CT trusted me to do. She believes that I have a good sense of creating

                       content.

                              My  realization  today  is  that  you  should  constantly  be  on  the  lookout  for


                       unexpected  announcements.  We  never  know  when  we'll  get  the  next  task,  so  I'm

                       hoping to develop the habit of checking my messenger accounts before going to bed

                       and after I wake up just in case an unforeseen circumstance happens. At the same

                              Today,  I  taught  grade  8  students,  and  I  began  with  the  typical  process  of

                       prayer, checking attendance, and supplying explanation for their earlier assessment.

                       Then, before starting the topic, I started with the activity by dividing the students into


                       two groups, which must be completed and gave to the Classin task after they have

                       presented  their  work  to  the  class.  It  will  be  added  to  the  task  so  that  it  may  be

                       recorded. The activity's outcome is positive since everyone received a perfect score.

                       Then I go on to the next topic for discussion. When students take part, they will get a

                       trophy as a reward, as is customary. Even though the topic was a little difficult, the


                       talk went off without a hitch thus far. I also gave my modules for grades 8 and 7 for

                       weeks  7  and  8  to my  cooperating  teacher,  which I  did  ahead  of time because  we

                       have long weekends, so I spent the day working on my papers. I also updated my

                       class records for students who gave late tasks. When I look at the students' work, I'm

                       a little sad because even though you tried your hardest to make learning easier for

                       them, some still can't cope with the topic, and when you give them an activity, you'll

                       see in their score that they're having difficulties understanding, but, understandably,


                       not all students can automatically catch up, which is why, as teachers, we're there to

                       remind  them  to  read  and  practice  often.  Regardless  of  whether  the  students

                       understand  the  material  quickly,  it's  only  a matter  of  looking  up the  good  aspects.

                       Although  it's  difficult  to  educate  the  other students,  you  must  still  rebuild  the

                       enthusiasm in your heart so that you don't lose your burning passion.


                              Today I understood that even if you feel ineffective with some students, look

                       for the positive side because even if two, three, or even five students have difficulty

                       understanding  you,  you  still  have  nearly  20  students  who  understand  and  answer

                       their exams wonderfully. Turn your bad feelings into something positive by focusing

                       on a cause that is important to you. Not all students are gifted enough to understand

                       all that is going on in the classroom, which is why you have varied intelligence and

                       diverse learners. It is the teacher's responsibility to plan for a balanced classroom.



                                                               49]]></page><page Index="297"><![CDATA[Group activities, in my opinion, are the ideal way to challenge children who struggle

                       Day 40:  02 December 2021


                              I teach grade 7, Sarah, and today I began with the routine of prayer, checking

                       attendance, and pleasantries, followed by a recall of the topic and finally, a topic that

                       was a continuation of the earlier one, which is the law of exponent. I also urged the

                       students  who  had  not  yet completed their  tasks  to  do  so to  reduce the  amount  of

                       work they would have to conduct.


                              I  used  the  question  methods  to  see  whether  they  could  catch  up  on  the

                       material and allowed them to do virtual board work to see how they processed the

                       information.

                              Because today is the last meeting of the week for the grade 7 mathematics

                       students, I completed the topic of the law of exponent and its application, but not all

                       the topics for the week because there were vacations and other major festivities at

                       our school. So far, the classroom has gone well, with a fresh set of lessons that will


                       serve as a solid basis for their upcoming mathematical theme.

                       After the lesson, I spent my time correcting my PowerPoint for the next topic, and I

                       am pleased to say that I completed it faster.

                              Today's insight is that I must always learn to limit my time. It is critical to know

                       how  to  manage  your  time  effectively  to  manage  your  workload,  and  I  pray  that  I


                       always finish my job on time to avoid workload burnout. I must take a break, for a

                       short break accumulated from long hours of work can help us be more productive.


















                                                               50]]></page><page Index="298"><![CDATA[Day 41:  03 December 2021

                              Today  I  taught  grade  8  students,  and  I  arrived  over  10  minutes  early  to

                       arrange the virtual class sit-up. Then I pray, verify attendance, and greet everyone,

                       before  recalling  the  prior  topic  and  moving  on  to  a  topic  we  started  at  the  last


                       meeting. The students have been highly active in their engagement thus far, while

                       others are simply waiting to be called. Understandably, they are students choose to

                       be  silent  listeners  in  class,  no  matter  how  you  encourage  them  to  reach  their  full

                       potential. As a teacher, do your best to instill confidence in them by reassuring them

                       that it's fine if they make errors; the most essential thing is that they are corrected


                       thereafter.  Before  the  time  ran  out,  the  students  expressed  their  concerns  and

                       reservations about the content, which is critical to their learning. Today's lesson went

                       off without a hitch, and I was pleased with my performance. I covered a meaningful

                       topic for them that would help them expand their knowledge.

                              Then  I  went  to  Ms.  Clarise's  class,  the grade  9  David,  which  is  run  by  ST

                       student  Sir  Mark.  After  the  session,  since  I  completed  my  grade  7  PowerPoint

                       yesterday, I spent the rest of my time editing the grade 8 PowerPoint. It has been a


                       productive day for me.

                              My discovery today is that I need to learn new things every day, especially in

                       dealing with kids, to help them reach their full potential and increase their confidence

                       because  I've  seen  that  they  are  reluctant  and  fearful  of  answering  incorrectly  on

                       every recitation. I'd like to see how kids manage incorrect answers and help them


                       understand  that  it's  fine  if  their  response  is  incorrect;  what  matters  is  that  they

                       learned from it and were corrected. I understand how difficult it may be to deal with

                       mistakes, but with the right approach, I believe I can learn to reduce those feelings

                       and turn them into a positive outlook.









                                                               51]]></page><page Index="299"><![CDATA[Day 42:  06 December 2021

                              I teach a grade 7 class today at 8 in the morning and end at 9 o'clock. After

                       my session, I saw a grade 10 Psalmuel science class with my cooperating teacher,

                       Ms. Reah. At around 1 o'clock in the afternoon, I saw Ms. Clarisse's class, which was


                       managed by Sir Mark St. students from CvSU Silang Campus.

                              During my discussion with the grade seven class, I followed my usual routine

                       from prayer, greetings, and checking of attendance, then recalling of the earlier topic.

                       It's been a challenging day since the topic is a little bit difficult for them, especially

                       since it is about the multiplication and division of binomials and trinomials. I sense the


                       intricacy  because  there  are  so  many  processes  and  guidelines  to  consider  in  this

                       topic, but even though I'm doubtful, I need to think on the bright side to support your

                       students through difficult moments.

                              One of my hopes is that before I begin my lesson, I will double-check that the

                       device is already connected to the charger to avoid this type of disaster.

                       Despite  the  topic's  difficulties,  the  students  tried  to  cooperate  as  best  they  could,

                       sharing  their  perspectives  on  how  they  understood  the  topic.  Although  students


                       struggled, we were there with a broad understanding, willing to extend as much as

                       we could just to lift our students' spirits in these trying times.

                              My revelation today is that, even though we have faced challenges, we must

                       keep our heads up and remain calm since whatever situations we face are beyond

                       our  control,  and  we  can  no  longer  do  anything  except  wait  for  the  process  to


                       complete. There are no shortcuts to success. If we want to be on top of all we do, we

                       must not skip the process but rather be attentive with prayers, because no matter

                       how  many  times  we  desire  a  flawless  moment,  when  something  is  designed  to

                       disrupt  us,  we  cannot  do  anything  except  be  aware  in  that  moment,  whether  it  is

                       good  or  unpleasant.  When  things  go  wrong,  don't  worry  since  it  won't  solve  the

                       problem; instead, stay cool and enjoy the experience.






                                                               52]]></page><page Index="300"><![CDATA[Similarly,  the  outcome we  want  will  always  be  decided  by  how  we  prepare

                       phase and leave the remaining tasks to God, which you no longer have control over.




                       Day 43:  07 December 2021

                              Today, I teach grades 7 and 8. This is the second day of the week for grade

                       7, so it's just a continuation of the prior topic. Because there's a little difficulty, some

                       students  have  been  asked  to  elaborate  further  on  the  problem,  which  is  critical

                       because  we'll  be  short  on  time  for  the  entire  week's  lesson.  Despite  this,  I  can


                       conclude the topic with the kids' participation and board activity.

                              As  I  approached  the  grade  8  class,  I  started  with  a  little  bit  of  humor  as  I

                       presented my joke as a motivational exercise for the students. Then go on to the oral

                       activity for them, which is part of the new topic's introduction. Then move on to the

                       next  section  of  the  discussion,  which  is  the  if-then  statement.  The  talk  was  light,

                       everyone could relate to the lesson, and there was a wonderful exchange of ideas

                       and dialogue. So far, the conversation has gone off without a hitch or obstacle. The


                       class ended then with a closing prayer.

                              After class, I used the rest of my time to create an assessment question for

                       the  second  assessment  month  or  quarter  2.  So,  I  need  to  prepare  questions  for

                       grades  7  and  8,  which  will  be  a  25-item  exam  that  must  be  approved  by  my

                       cooperating teacher.


                              My epiphany for the day was that we do not always face challenges. If you

                       had  difficulties  the  day  before,  the  next  day  can  be  different.  Like  what  I've

                       experienced  today,  which  has  rekindled  my  enthusiasm  for  teaching.  This  day

                       revealed that whatever we go through in life, what we hold in our hearts will be fed by

                       each unique experience. Just don't give up and constantly keep your heart open to

                       new changes that come knocking.






                                                               53]]></page><page Index="301"><![CDATA[Day 44:  09 December 2021

                              As part of the one-week subject discussion, I am teaching grade 7 today. I

                       tried my  hardest to  finish  the  topic  after  I  completed the regular  procedure for  the


                       class, but I struggled since one of the students' worries is that they want me to repeat

                       the entire process, which makes it difficult for me. This is one of the most difficult

                       aspects of being a teacher. You want to move on to the next part of the conversation,

                       yet the students want you to go over everything again. When the time was running

                       out, I had no choice but to stop it and find another time. This aspect of the experience


                       is where I want to improve on how to manage and manage appropriately, particularly

                       when students ask you to repeat the discussion when they don't understand. After

                       class,  I  spent  the  rest  of  my  time  creating  Kahoot  tasks  for  the  grade  8  students,

                       which were due on Friday. As a warm-up for their monthly test, I'd want to review

                       them through games.

                              Today's  understanding  is  that  no  matter  what  occurs,  I  must  continue  to

                       strive. Try to excel uniquely. Our approach is not always effective, but we must look


                       forward and do our best to improve what we have since our road to success is still

                       long. As we can see, even those with a lot of expertise have failures, just as I did

                       when I was a novice, but the essential thing is that we are willing to accept failure

                       and be mentored by others because our range of experience is so broad, unexpected

                       events may arise out of nowhere, but the most essential thing for everyone is to trust


                       God.  No  one  would  be  against  you  being  successful  if  God  wants  you  to  be

                       successful.

                              Today  I  teach  one  class,  grade  8  Genesis,  and  simultaneously  see  Ms.

                       Clarise's grade 9 David class, which is overseen by Sir Mark the ST students. The

                       rest  of  my  time  was  spent  inputting  questions  into  class  as preparation  for  the


                       monthly  exam,  which  will  take  place  next  week,  December  14  to  17.  So  far,  I've

                       completed it and told my cooperating teacher that I've completed my task.

                       Since today is merely a continuation of the entire week's topic, I try to finish all the

                       remaining lessons in my Grade 8 class by following the routine. Fortunately, I made

                       it.


                              Since I told them at the last meeting that we were going to build a gaming

                       activity as part of a review for their forthcoming assessment using the Kahoot apps, I

                       decided  to  let  them  play.  I've  created  a  ten-item  list  of  questions.  Students  will

                       answer  questions  with  a  time  limit  on  the  Kahoot  apps,  and  they  must  answer  as

                       quickly as possible to get more points.

                              I  was  initially  anxious  since  this  was  my  first  time  using  the  apps,  and  I

                       struggled to integrate them into the lesson, but after a minute of experimenting, I was


                       able to present them in class. Since the class is experiencing this for the first time

                       too, they  are  also  anxious  because  we  learned  that  the  options  do  not  display  on

                       their devices, so they must look at them on my share screen to see the options.

                       It's  been  fascinating  to  see  people  experiment  with  different  methods  of  learning.

                       There  are  students  feel  ecstatic  because  they  made  the  top  three,  but  others  are


                       frustrated because they aspire to be at the top but have difficulties managing it. Every

                       one  of  the  students  will  fail;  what  matters  is  their  sportsmanship  in  accepting  and

                       dealing with failure.

                              Today's class made me a bit emotional, and I felt a pinch of sadness in my

                       heart when Mis Rea, my cooperating teacher, reminded the class that I might only

                       have two days left to teach them because I'm almost done with my time as a student-

                       teacher. I'm fighting back my emotions but not my heartache, since I know I'll miss



                                                               55]]></page><page Index="303"><![CDATA[my  job  and  my  students.  I  can't  think  that  after  just  a  few  weeks  of  forming

                       relationships  with  the  students,  I'll  be  able  to  carve  a  place  in  my  heart  for  them.

                       Through that, I realized that if you spent the entire year educating students and then

                       spent the rest of your life mentoring them, your eyes would be brimming with tears


                       when there was a sudden stop to your work.

                              My  epiphany  today  is  that  every  ounce  of  effort  and  time  you  put  in  will

                       undoubtedly cause you pain when the time comes to say goodbye, but life is a fight

                       of coming and going; there are times when an hour will come to form memories, and

                       there are moments when some individuals will arrive to leave a pleasant or painful


                       memory in our hearts; the most important thing is that you lived your best life while

                       they were still with you and you're still able to speak with them. The significance of all

                       this is the tracks you leave behind, footsteps that will remind people of you. Leave as

                       much as you can to inspire others, offer value to others, and allow people to feel that

                       in  their  moments  of  weakness,  someone  stood  by  them,  encouraging  them  to

                       succeed  on  their  path  to  learning.  This  makes  me  pleased,  especially  when  I

                       consider that I am making a difference. I am teaching others. I am adding learning


                       today. I am a part of their lives.



                              Day 46:  13 December 2021

                              I'm  teaching  the  grade  7  Sarah  class  today,  and  because  it's  assessment

                       month, I'm merely using PowerPoint to prepare a reviewer for them. After the regular


                       sequence of prayer, pleasantries, and verifying attendance, I go on to topic recall,

                       such  as  polynomial  multiplication.  It's  been  a  difficult  topic  for  them,  and  I'm

                       concerned about their evaluation score since they still struggled to answer some of

                       my  questions  because there  are so  many  stages  and  rules to  follow  to  get  to  the

                       correct solution. Although pupils struggled, others were able to quickly adjust to the

                       content. It is a characteristic of a multifaceted learner.






                                                               56]]></page><page Index="304"><![CDATA[After  my  class  in  grade  7,  I  saw  David  in  grade  9  with  the  Sir  Mark  ST

                       students who were distributed to them. Based on my observations and experience,

                       I've concluded that not all students will like you right away. Getting along with them

                       will  be  a  long  process.  It  will  take  time  for  children  to  trust  you  and  express  their


                       confidence in you, particularly when it comes to sharing their ideas and opinions. It's

                       difficult to trust someone you've just met, and that's what I'd like to concentrate on:

                       how to acquire the kids' entire confidence and trust in a short period. I recall one of

                       my mentors/teachers asking for personal interests, abilities, and even hobbies, then

                       connecting them to every conversation we had as a tactic for gaining the trust and


                       hearts of the students. He uses witty language and jokes from time to time so that

                       everyone can empathize and laugh till they open and feel comfortable revealing who

                       they are. Incredibly, he had extra time to approach us as his students through the

                       messenger  even  though  the actual  class  time  was  done.  Those  tactics  for  getting

                       along with the children impressed me. And I intend to change it in the future for the

                       sake of getting along with new students, particularly when we are in the current world

                       of work.




                       Day 47:   14, December 2021

                              Today is Sarah's second monthly evaluation in grade 7. I still began with a

                       prayer,  followed  by  a  check  of  attendance  and  pleasantries.  On  this  day  off

                       evaluation, everyone has been present thus far. Some pupils appeared to be both


                       delighted and worried, but I feel I did all I could to ensure that they were prepared for

                       this day. And now it's their chance to show how well-prepared they are for another

                       assessment that coincides with becoming a student. I'm hoping that the exam, which

                       includes  a  25-item  and  a  3-point  bonus  question,  will  be  a  good  way  for  them  to

                       assess their learning and go smoothly.

                              Technicalities will not vanish as part of this new normal education experience.

                       I had difficulty reading my monitor since the letters on the exam I supplied were too



                                                               57]]></page><page Index="305"><![CDATA[small for my eyes to read, yet the letters were visible to the student. I couldn't refresh

                       the  test  because  it  was  already  set,  so  I  just  waited  for  the  student  to  submit  the

                       exam.  Another  complication  is  the  automatic  shutdown  of  my  monitor  when  my

                       battery is low; I'm now facing this issue since I frequently forget to charge my laptop


                       before attending a virtual class. My CT informed me that I needed to be aware of it to

                       prevent  this  from  happening  at  the  final  demo.  This  frightened  me  a  little,  but  I'm

                       hoping to keep alert throughout the day.

                              After  reviewing  the  students'  tests,  I  discovered  that  more  students  did  not

                       receive  a  passing  mark  than  in  the  previous  month's  assessment.  In  the  earlier


                       assessment, only two students needed a repeat, but nearly ten students required a

                       retake in this month's evaluation. It's upsetting for the instructor when you've given it

                       your all and they're still having trouble with the test. This aspect of the experience is

                       a genuinely painful experience, but through it, we get stronger. Every new sensation,

                       whether it is pain or emotional attachment to the students, is all part of the invested

                       relationship.

                              I discovered that the emotion we have for the children is unpredictable and


                       cultivated  throughout  our  interactions  with  them.  The  longer  we  stayed,  the  more

                       conflicted  emotions  we  experienced.  And  we  must  be  prepared  to  deal  with  it,

                       particularly  in  this  day  of  constant  transformation.  Life  is  a  fight  of  emotions,  and

                       when we manage them right, we may inspire others. Yet, if we fail, the consequences

                       can be far-reaching, causing conflict inside ourselves and among those around us.


                       One thought that came to me is that when things get unbearable, place them in the

                       hands of the creator. When you know you've done your best, trust God to take care

                       of the rest. You will be an achiever if you are a dreamer, and this will guide you to

                       your aim and vision. No bad sensations can block your vision. Stick to the goal since

                       adversity pales in comparison to the aspirations God has placed in our hearts.

                              Since it is still assessment week and I only have two days to meet with the

                       students for their examination schedule, which is Tuesday for grade 7 and Thursday


                       for  grade  8,  I  just  spent  my  whole  day  working  on  students'  records.  I  track  and

                       record  the  work  and  activities  of  various  students  to  lessen  the  impact  of  tasks.

                       Examining  the  kids'  assessment  scores,  particularly  grade  7,  which  was  given

                       yesterday at the monthly assessment, analyze where the students’ made mistakes

                       for  me  to  understand  in  what  ways  the  kids  are  still  struggling.  tracing  their  prior


                       performance,  such  as  participation,  attendance, tasks,  and  activities  that  are  still

                       pending. Then send them notifications about the activities and tasks that they need to

                       comply with.

                              Even  though  there  was  a  busy  schedule,  I  realized  that  a  time  like  this  is

                       crucial because it allows you to digest how the entire month of your teaching went.

                       How the students' performances met was one of my strongest indications that I am

                       effective in teaching. When I discover that many learners succeed in the areas I am


                       working  with,  I  become  overwhelmed.  When  I  learned  that  more  students  were

                       increasing their grades for that marking period, it was like a dream come true. I will

                       always be an inspiration to the learners and urge them to work hard to please their

                       parents. Despite the hardships that their parents face, their children's greatness and

                       accomplishments at school will provide them with the energy they need to continue


                       their sacrifices. This will act as a terrific incentive for them to keep working on seeing

                       their child's aspirations come to reality.

                              The monthly assessment for grade 8 is scheduled for today. The first thing I

                       did  was  set  an  exam  timer,  and  then  I  began  with  a  prayer  and  a  check  of

                       attendance. The test went well, but you may meet individuals who are adamant about


                       their answer, even if it is incorrect, since they want to be at the top of their class. We

                       can't blame them since they're under a lot of pressure. It's understandable because

                       they have a reputation to uphold. It reminds me of how I used to have a competitive

                       mindset but how I gradually changed and prayed for it to vanish since I considered it

                       unhealthy, especially for our friends whom we rely on in times of need. Having this


                       mentality  alienates  you  from  your  friends  and  makes  you  feel  lonely.  For  me,  the

                       worst aspect of being a student is having no one to talk to since your classmates

                       don't get along with you because you are aiming to be on top. This reminds me of

                       one of my professors who said that we must learn to admit when we are wrong and

                       not always that what we believe is correct, and that when that time comes, there is

                       no point in insisting on our beliefs because sometimes what matters most is the love

                       and respect of higher authorities.


                              Today serves as a reminder to me that while it is not bad to remain firm in our

                       convictions, balancing the circumstances and seeking an answer on our own may be

                       beneficial, particularly in times of doubt. Doubts about others' perfectionism, as well

                       as doubts about ourselves I used to believe that we had to figure out solutions to all

                       our problems on our own first, and that being resourceful and trusting someone with


                       ability  to  make  us  better  people.  Studying  and  appreciating  those  in  positions  of

                       authority may have a considerable influence and teach us valuable lessons on our

                       life's  path.  I'm  not  suggesting  that  we  should  trust  everything  we  hear  but  being

                       balanced in quiet makes us better competent in handling whatever work or obligation

                       we have. On my side, it can be off-putting to come across a competitive person, but

                       this person, whom God allows to be a part of our lives, supplies a pepper as a spice

                       to help us grow as people and educators. There's a time for everything, and there's a



                                                               60]]></page><page Index="308"><![CDATA[cause  for  everything.  It's  a  privilege  to  meet  young  minds  who  understand  their

                       responsibilities and strive to maintain the pressure behind every victory they achieve.

                       Life is a series of circumstances, and how we respond to and accept them decides

                       how far we progress. There may be some who criticize us and don't understand what


                       we're fighting for but keeping true to ourselves is the most important thing we can

                       do.

                              As  I  progress  in  my  career,  I  pray  that  God  gives  me  an  attitude  that  is

                       accepted and may encourage others. The value we can leave on this planet is often

                       decided by what we offer to other people rather than what we stand for. To all who


                       aided us in achieving our goals: It is ingrained in our hearts to continually want to

                       satisfy  people,  which  is  why  we  are  under  pressure.  The current  world  isn't  about

                       competition;  it's  about  collaboration  and  moving  as  a  group  transforms  us  into  a

                       magnificent artwork of life.



                       Day 50:   17 December 2021

                              I don't have to meet with the kids today, so I'm focusing on the next topic that


                       will be discussed at the next meeting. Because today is the last working day before

                       the Christmas break, I make it a point to work on the students' outstanding records. I

                       also worked on and planned my forthcoming demo, which is set for January 5. The

                       topic I chose, the lesson plan, and the instructional materials must be ready. I'll have

                       to  submit  it  to  my  CT  for  feedback  and  improvement  later.  It  will  require  planning


                       because  this  is  my  last  demonstration  and  the  capstone  of  my  whole  student

                       teaching experience. I shall be judged based on how well I perform my duties as a

                       teacher. I want to be the best on that day, so I'm going to put in a lot of effort.

                              My discovery for today is that even if you are not sure of the outcome, you

                       must  do  your  hardest  and  devote  a  significant  amount  of  time  and  effort  to  avoid

                       being  disappointed  by  the  event.  Since  the  outcome  is  always  reliant  on  how  we

                       prepare things before they occur, I believe that nothing is impossible when you do



                                                               61]]></page><page Index="309"><![CDATA[everything. Just trust God and then trust the process. Believe that you have already

                       improved. You are not the same anymore as you were on the first day of teaching.

                       You learn, and that learning is already a good foundation to have a heads-up upon

                       facing this big day.


                              When I remember the final demonstration, I get mixed emotions. At the same

                       time, excited because this might be the end of my journey as a student-teacher, at

                       the same time sad because the smile on my students' faces can't be seen anymore. I

                       need to count on the memories we shared with the students at the same time with

                       my cooperating teacher. The last feeling is that I need to accept that I will be facing


                       sleepless  nights  preparing  everything  to  have  a  good  result,  but  it  is  preferable to

                       make a sacrifice today than to apologize later. No matter what you're afraid of, a hard

                       effort is always the key. Just always remember, "Hard work beats talent when talent

                       doesn’t work hard" – Tim Notke.



                       Day 51: 03 January 2022

                              The classroom was taken over by Ms. Rea, my cooperating teacher, to teach


                       grade 7 Sarah, to allow me to prepare for my demo teaching, which was scheduled

                       for Wednesday. I will just provide her with the module and the PowerPoint for the

                       discussion.  Then  I  spent  my  time  editing  my  lesson  plans  and  PowerPoint  for  the

                       demo because the changes continued, especially in the flow of the discussion. I have

                       seen that Ms. Rea is also under pressure, but I trust that everything will go well on


                       my demo day. I prepared, and this is enough so that I can deliver it confidently.

                       She begins the session with a prayer, pleasantries, and motivating activities, as is

                       her regular procedure. Her way of delivering the lessons features a dynamic teaching

                       and learning process. The students enjoy what they're doing.

                       There  is  a  graphic  depiction  to  attract  the  students'  attention  as  the  discussion

                       proceeds. Simultaneously, a real-life representation is used to relate the principles to

                       the student's experiences.



                                                               62]]></page><page Index="310"><![CDATA[The students' learning time was spent more on individual attention,  seeing,

                       and taking notes. There was also a direct activity letting the students prove on the

                       virtual board what they had learned. She employs informal assessment for students

                       such  as  observational  learning,  open-ended  inquiry,  and  verbal  evaluation.  The


                       session was well-managed, and the students had a fantastic time learning.

                              As  a  result  of  my  realization  today,  I've  been  reminded  to  always  connect

                       concepts  to  a  real-life  example  in  the  classroom  because  students  become  more

                       interested  and  eager  to  participate  in  the  discussion  if  this  happens,  and  students

                       have a better chance of remembering the concepts, resulting in lifelong learning. On


                       my CT's part, I like her character of having a heart of consideration and a willingness

                       to aid in the same way. That's a character I've always admired.



                       Day 52: 04 January 2022

                              Grade 7 Sarah and my cooperating teacher continue the week's topic today.

                       It was the same approach that was used yesterday because it was just part of the

                       unit lesson. I oversaw grade 8 class Genesis from 10:00 to 11:00, which I considered


                       a preparatory topic for my final demo teaching, which was the mathematical system.

                       This  is  the  first  day  of  the  class,  so  it's  just  an  introduction  to  the  entire  week's

                       subject.

                              In this  session, I  began  with  a  prayer,  greetings,  attendance  checking,  and

                       motivation. The students' time was spent during the discussion through observation


                       learning,  taking  notes,  and  individual  learning.  I  employed  informal  assessment

                       methods  such  as  open-ended  questions  during  discussion,  verbal  recitation,

                       observation  of  how  the  students  behave  in  class,  and  monitoring  while  they  were

                       engaged  in  certain  tasks  to  assess  them,  and  the  informal  assessment's  findings

                       were positive.

                              To  be  positive  and  trust  God  in  everything  you  do  is  my  revelation  today,

                       since if we dream big for ourselves, so does our God. He is the one who is striving



                                                               63]]></page><page Index="311"><![CDATA[and  preparing for  us  to become  better  and more  successful  so  that  we  may  be  a

                       give it your all to be molded. You just need to know how to listen and pay attention

                       Day 53:   05 January 2022

                              Today is the most important day of my whole practice teaching career since it

                       will be the day when my effectiveness will be evaluated. Our head chair of TED and


                       ST adviser, Ms. Mildred Sebastian, Sir Micheal Aquino, of TFUCS JHS coordinator,

                       and  Ms.  Mary  Joy  Mojica,  Mathematics  teacher,  will  assess  all  the  learning

                       experiences  I  have  accumulated.  There  are  goosebumps  in  my  heart,  but  I'm

                       optimistic; I've prepared well, and I've spent a sleepless night just to be better on this

                       day with Ms. Rea Olleres' support and the pieces of preparation we conducted. I feel

                       confident in my ability to do well on this day since all forms of preparation to be the

                       best on this day were reviewed over and over before we made our final verdict.


                              During my session, I started with prayer, greeting, classroom management, or

                       rules  just  to  remind  the  students  and  panelists  of  the  restrictions  if  they  are  not

                       familiar  with  the  virtual  classroom  yet,  and  I  believe  it  is  significant  to  create  a

                       harmonic flow of discussion. Then I go through the prior topic and then motivation. As

                       my motivation, I used Kahoot apps, a learning game application. This is significant,


                       for  the reality  of  the  younger  generation  rising  in  the  digital  age  is  that  they  are

                       practically addicted to game applications. It's interesting to them that while they enjoy

                       video games, they may also learn from them, which helps them to assist in getting

                       ready for their future lesson discovery. Then, before moving on to my major topic, I

                       used  a  video  presentation  to  attract  their  attention.  I  believed  that  a  presentation

                       would influence my class since it would supply more knowledge and that the use of

                       ICT would be a wonderful way to pique the students' attention. During my discussion,



                                                               64]]></page><page Index="312"><![CDATA[the students spent their time seeing, taking notes, participating in individual learning,

                       and taking part in large group discussions throughout my lecture. I allowed them to

                       use  the  models  to  present  during  a  group  presentation;  I  offered  a  direct  activity

                       as an extra learning experience; and I employed audio-visual to attract their attention.


                       I used both formal and informal assessments to examine the students. I was formal

                       in the sense that I let them take an individual exercise in which I collected and graded

                       them  according  to  the  correct  items  they  got.  Informal  assessment  in  the  form  of

                       games  and  recitation,  and  groups, which  isn't  scored  since  I  only  observed  the

                       students' behavior in class, as well as their actions while doing and having specific


                       activities. Then, throughout the session, there is a question-and-answer part. After a

                       certain activity, I just give them a remark.

                              My realization is that nothing is impossible when you want to dream big and

                       have the best of everything. You may face trials and sacrifices; sleepless nights and

                       stress; problems and barriers; and the worst thing is that other people may also make

                       sacrifices to reach what is best. At least you have done your best to receive a reward

                       of satisfaction for that action. The last point is that when the ultimate moment arrives,


                       you  should  let  everything  happen  as  it  is  supposed  to  happen,  since  the  most

                       important part of all is how you prepared everything before allowing it to happen.

                       This day is a wonderful one for me because I received positive comments from the

                       panelists  on  my  final  demo  after  that  tough  time.  I  may  say  that  I  am  conducted

                       because of it.




                       Day 54:   06 January 2022

                              Today, I'm simply observing Ms. Rea's class, which is grade seven Sarah's.

                       It's the last day of the week's geometry topic. As she continued the discussion, after

                       the  usual  routines  and  recalls,  she  went  ahead  with  a  question  and  answer,  a

                       recitation of the students, and then a large group discussion, because the class was

                       divided  into  three.  This  grouping  serves  as  a  formal  assessment  because  she



                                                               65]]></page><page Index="313"><![CDATA[recorded  the  scores  of  the  students.  She  also  used  informal  assessment  during

                       recitation,  open-ended  questions,  and  verbal  assessment.  The  students'  time  in

                       learning was spent through individual work, observation, note-taking, and large group

                       discussion. She closes the whole week's topic with a summary and a verbal activity,


                       which is an answer and a question to the prepared assessment.

                              Today, I realized that as time goes on, there is always room for progress. If

                       you now feel like you're not good enough, like you're at the bottom, don't worry; just

                       go after what you want and dream of, because the most important thing is that you're

                       working from the heart, that you're giving your all from the bottom of your heart, and


                       that  every  action  you  take  is  made  with  love.  Just  remember  for  whom  you  are

                       working because this will serve as a recharge, something to reflect on when you are

                       feeling drained or out of steam. Just remember, life is full of difficulties. Just play by

                       the rules of life and do what is best for you without interfering with others' hopes and

                       aspirations. Continue to inspire others and aid them in achieving their goals, because

                       your charitable deeds will one day serve as your weapon in achieving a fulfilling life.

                       Even though others don’t appreciate what you have done, just continue to make a


                       difference and do your best for the welfare of the students and the organization you

                       belong to. Every work of the hands with a heart will be paid off according to how it is

                       invested. A good return will be earned if you invest right.



                       Day 55:  07 January 2022


                              Today,  I'm  teaching  grade  8  Genesis  as  part  of  the  whole-week  topic

                       continuation. I began with a prayer, pleasantries, and attendance, and then a review

                       of the topic. Then I go ahead with the remaining lessons, which are about defined

                       terms  and  the  second  classification  of  a  mathematical  system.  Individual,

                       observational, verbal, open-ended questioning, and small group discussion were the

                       methods used by the students to learn. I used both formal and informal assessments

                       to  examine the  students. formal  through  group work  in  which students' scores  are



                                                               66]]></page><page Index="314"><![CDATA[collected,  then  informal  in  a  form  of  recitation  during  a  discussion,  seeing  the

                       students on their class behavior and checking their actions while they are doing a

                       certain activity. The result of the evaluation is excellent because almost all students

                       got the correct answer. However, the result of my informal assessment is that there


                       are  still  students  who  are  hesitant  to  share  their  thoughts,  and  even  though  you

                       encourage  them  to  speak,  they  prefer  to  remain  silent,  and  it  still  takes  time  to

                       develop. I didn't believe that students didn't know the answer when they neglected

                       presenting since they achieved excellent on a test, they just had a lack of confidence

                       in speaking or reporting. I remember my days when I was on the same grade level as


                       my classmates. I was forced by my teacher to speak and take the risk of having an

                       individual report, which became my first foundation so that I could stand in front of my

                       classmates. While on my student part today, they had a choice to choose whether to

                       speak or not, but the big opportunity was missed. It is sad because they missed the

                       moment to stand and let themselves shine. I also attended my scheduled evaluation,

                       where the results and comments on my final demo teaching were released. So far, I

                       am pleased with the results and responses of the panelists. They reminded me to


                       perform better through the words they said. When students are troubled by anything,

                       you must supply some reassuring words to help them forget about the unpleasant

                       ideas  that  are  distracting  them.  I  passionately  believe  that  I  did  my  best,  that  I

                       prepared extensively on that day, and that I should not be concerned about anything

                       since if my best is not good enough, this will serve as another opportunity for growth.


                       I can't deny that I have a feeling that something isn't the finest of all, and that notion

                       may prevent me from achieving the objectives I've set for myself, but there comes a

                       moment in each season when it is difficult to reach. Don't worry; you did all you could

                       according to your ability. You don't know someone's story about how they obtained

                       such excellence, and they don't know your own story either. You sacrifice to be the

                       best. Simply appreciate what would be the result.






                                                               67]]></page><page Index="315"><![CDATA[I  realize  that  everyone  has  their  own  success  journey.  There  is  something

                       Day 56:  10, January 2022.

                              As my demo teaching has already passed, I wasn't permitted to teach further


                       today.  So,  Ms.  Rea  takes  over  the  class,  so  I'm  simply  here  to  do  my  5  days  of

                       observation for daily  time  record  completion to  reach  the  60-day  job  as  a  student-

                       teacher.

                              The discussion was completed to better understand the topics. She opens the

                       lecture  with  an  activity  to  get  the  students'  attention  and  motivate  them.  Visual

                       displays  were  also  used.  During  the  lecture,  the  students  spent  their  time  doing

                       individual  learning,  taking  notes,  and  seeing.  An  informal  evaluation,  such  as  an


                       open-ended  inquiry,  verbal,  or  recitation,  was  used  to  assess  the  students.

                       Simultaneously, it is observational learning because no grade is acquired; instead,

                       they are awarded trophies that serve as an incentive, prompting students to avidly

                       engage.

                              Every day will be a fresh beginning, as I've realized today. What you've gone


                       through will always teach you knew things about life. I've missed how I teach every

                       day and sitting down and listening to the discussion is a new challenge for me. I'd like

                       to return to teaching, but my time is up. I'm not already permitted since I'm simply

                       here to complete paperwork and give a presentation. I missed my regular routines

                       like student interaction, but time tells other tasks; just wait for the perfect time that

                       Day 57:  11, January 2022.

                              I saw Ms. Rea today in grades 7 and 8. All I'm doing now is keeping an eye

                       on the class. Her teaching style, which was always focused on the details, impressed

                       me.  a  little  detail  that  I  had  previously  ignored,  but  owing  to  her  guidance,  I  now


                       recognize its value.

                              In the Grade 7 class, a continuation of the  earlier discussion took place on

                       Monday. A recap of the material was given to the students to begin. The purpose of

                       the  conversations  was  to  ensure  that  the  pupils  understood  the  principles.  Visual

                       displays are used to pique the kids' interest. The students spent their time learning

                       both individually and in groups. There is also observational learning and taking notes.

                       The  students  were  assessed  through  formal  and  informal  assessments.  formal


                       evaluation in the form of groups since the score was gathered and recorded for their

                       grades  after  they  presented  their  work.  Informal  evaluation  might  take  the  form  of

                       recitation, open-ended questions, or verbal assessment.

                              Ms. Rea began the first meeting with encouragement through an activity for

                       the Grade 8 Genesis class. She allowed the kids to answer prepared questions to


                       grab  their  attention.  There  was  a  visual  exhibit  and  a  direct  exercise.  During  the

                       class,  the  student  spends  time  on  individual  learning,  direct  activities,  and

                       observation  while  taking  notes.  Informal  assessments  are  used  to  evaluate  them.

                       During  the  exercise,  there  is  an  observation  of  the  student's  behavior.  There  is  a

                       verbal assessment and an open-ended inquiry.

                              My realization should always be encouraged. Begin your day with a sense of

                       possibility.  Allow  the  unmanageable  circumstances  to  be  controlled  by  time.  I'm



                                                               69]]></page><page Index="317"><![CDATA[fighting  my  emotions  today;  I'm  having  conflicting  sentiments,  which  I  suspect  is

                       since my time with the children is now so limited. I'm looking forward to living them

                       and discovering how time has led me to new horizons in my new path. Life is about

                       winning  every  feeling  you  give  to  each  one,  not  only conquering  your  abilities  and


                       information. I've gotten a whole bundle out of this experience since I've developed

                       not just mentally but also personally. I've rethought how I think about teaching in the

                       past  year.  The  goal  of  teaching  is  to  build  personalities  in  addition  to  imparting

                       knowledge. Leave an impression on the students with whom you've worked in the

                       past. Even though few people will remember you, the few people you meet in a brief


                       period will leave an indelible mark on their lives. Life and experiences change all the

                       time,  so  you  must  be  ready  to  say  goodbye  and  accept  another  opportunity  to

                       develop. Always be willing to accept tricky situations, whether they are unpleasant or

                       bring  you  enjoyment.  Now  I  understand  how  the  teacher  feels  when  the  students

                       quickly  forget  the  connection  you've  established.  Always  respect  and  adore  our

                       professors, for they have been through various circumstances to educate us. They've

                       made a lot of physical, mental, and emotional sacrifices. Kudos to all the instructors


                       I've met and will meet in the future. May God keep me in a state of constant gratitude

                       and appreciation for what they've done for me.



                       Day 58:   12 January 2022

                              Today,  Mis  Rea  is  teaching  grade  8 Genesis.  I  watch  the  class  while  also


                       working  on  the module for Quarter 3  weeks  3  and  4,  which  I  gave  for  review  and

                       approval shortly after I finished it. Ms. Rea offers a concept comprehension lesson

                       that supplies a solid platform for students to link topics in a more complex manner.

                       She began the lecture by going over the prior topic in detail. To grab the students'

                       attention,  she  employs  visual  presentations.  During  the  class,  the  students  spent

                       their time learning on their own and taking part in small group discussions. There was

                       direct  involvement,  as  well  as  observation  and  note-taking.  The  students  were



                                                               70]]></page><page Index="318"><![CDATA[assessed  using  informal  assessment,  which  consisted  of  simply  seeing  how  they

                       learned,  how  they  behaved  during  discussions,  and  how  they  responded  to  other

                       activities.  The  class  was  ended  by  delivering  a  summary  and  collection  of  group

                       activity  outcomes  at  the  following  meeting.  The  submission  of  the  activity  is  being


                       considered.

                              Today, I've concluded that life experiences provide us with valuable lessons

                       that  help  us  improve.  It  is  part  of  the  process  when  something  awkward  occurs.  I

                       sympathize with the students because they feel ashamed every time, they take part

                       and supply a mistaken response, which leads to a lack of confidence. As teachers,


                       we must reassure children that even if they give a poor response, it is okay since

                       they have given their all to take part. We don't always get perfect students who won't

                       make mistakes, as it was once said that scientists and inventors must fail many times

                       before they produce the perfect product, as evidenced by the life experience of the

                       florescent  inventor  Edison,  who  failed  1000  times  before  producing  the  perfect

                       product,  which  we  now  enjoy.  To  avoid  being  affected  by  the  students'  incorrect

                       replies to our questions, we must learn how to deal with them.




                        Day 59: 13 January 2022

                              Today, Ms. Rea oversaw the grade 7 class; I was only there to see. Since this

                       is  the  last  day  of  the  week  for  the  grade  7  subject,  practically  all  the  topics  have

                       already been addressed, so the students only must take a quiz to see how well they


                       understand the material.

                              While  taking  the  quiz,  I  noticed  that  students  expressed  concern  that  they

                       were not ready, but Ms. Rea assures us that even those who say they are not ready

                       should take the quiz as part of their learning improvement. Ms. Rea was just given an

                       extension on the submission to give her time to review it because she was not ready.

                       As I saw them having time upon taking the quiz, not all students completed the quiz

                       before the timer ran out. Only about half of the students' class  gave the work. We



                                                               71]]></page><page Index="319"><![CDATA[have no choice but to expand and accept their paper because we are in a new and

                       student's and teacher's sides.

                              Even  if  one  student  said  that  she  was  not  ready,  I  realized  today  that  the


                       activities must continue because more than 20 kids have stated that they are ready

                       and prepared for the evaluation. We must just expand our awareness that there may

                       be reasons why she says this, but it is disheartening when you inform the students

                       that there will be an exam and they declare they are not ready. As teachers, we are

                       there  not  simply  to  share  our knowledge  but  also to  instill  trust  and to  understand


                       each child's circumstances. We just address them correctly and reassure them that

                       their issue is considered and appreciated. We made a space for them such that they

                       could rely on us when there were doubts.



                       Day 60:   14 January 2022

                              Today,  I'm  teaching  grade  8  since  Miss  Rea  gave  me  another  chance  to

                       teach  the  class.  Given  that  today  is  the  last  day  of  the  week's  topics,  it  is  just  a


                       continuation  of  the  previous  day's  topic.  Since  there  were  just  group  activities

                       scheduled for today, I simply let the students display their work.

                              Visual  displays  were  employed  to  pique  the  students'  interests.  Individual

                       learning,  large  group  discussion,  observation  learning,  taking  notes,  and  direct

                       activities  were  all  part  of  the  student's  learning  time.  Formal  and  informal


                       assessments,  such  as  group  work  and  individual  activities  in  which  the  students'

                       scores  were  gathered  and  recorded,  were  used  to  aid  the  students.  There  was

                       informal  assessment  in  the  sense  that  the  learner  was  seen  while  completing  the

                       exercise, answering an open-ended question, and recitation in which the trophy icon

                       served as a reward each time they took part. Through a collection of activities, the

                       class ended. Due to the concern of certain students who suffer from network logging,

                       my guidelines for this class were to allow students to give their work even beyond the



                                                               72]]></page><page Index="320"><![CDATA[deadline  lesson.  Today's  lesson  will  be  beneficial  in  laying  the  groundwork  for

                       topic, which is about proving.

                              Today,  I  realized  that  I  should  always  supply  students  the  opportunity  to


                       correct their work, like in presenting their activity, for it is helpful for them to build their

                       fixing them has a considerable influence on their lives. It may be painful, but as part

                       of learning, that pain may be transformed into beauty when it is managed properly.

                              The  common  classroom  problem  I  encounter  because  of  out-of-memory


                       space and a poor internet connection, I encounter gadget logs, which creates a delay

                       in  joining  my  virtual  classroom  not  only  on  my  side  as  a  teacher  but  also  on  the

                       students'. To alleviate the problem of students logging on, there is a playback option

                       for them to be used at any moment to rewatch the class discussion and stay up to

                       date  on  the  discussion.  On  my  side,  I  usually  refresh  my  gadgets  to  be  back  to

                       normal. I also run into an automatic Windows upgrade while delivering the lesson,

                       which causes trouble. To make sure it doesn't happen again, I update the software


                       immediately whenever I get a notification.

                              My workplace can be a source of tension for me because there is destructive

                       noise during the delivery of the lessons, such as dogs, chicken sounds, and children

                       playing. The solution to this is background noise cancellation software such as Krisp.

                              The  behavior  of  a  learner in a specific  exercise is  another  challenge  I face.


                       They take too long to complete their tasks until the deadline  for obtaining a grade

                       from the admin approaches. even though you keep reminding them over and over.

                       Helping them needs a lot of patience. The easiest way to fix it is to have a one-on-

                       one  discussion  with  the  student;  if  that  doesn't work,  my  CT talks to the  student's

                       parents about their child's status.

                              The  next  issue  that  arises  during  the  discussion  is  that  since mathematics

                       topics  are  mostly  concerned  with  calculation,  you provide  students  access  to  the


                       board,  which  takes  a  long  time,  especially  when  it  comes  to demonstrating  their

                       computations or solutions to the class using their mouse. It's a real struggle for them,

                       and  it  sometimes  leads  them  to give  up  on  illustrating  their  ways.  To  solve  this,  I

                       recommend  the  students  use the  tablet  pen  to  boost  their  learning  during  the

                       discussion since I believe students may learn through peer learning as well.

                              Three weeks before the big day, I'm planning and organizing the topics and


                       activities for my final demo teaching, which is scheduled for January 5th, 2021. My

                       ST student tried my hardest to include gaming applications into my teaching from the

                       beginning of my ST student, but my CT refused since it was time-consuming. She

                       said that it may cause a delay, so I just understand her. I never informed my CT that

                       I'd  be  using  it  on  my  final  demo.  I  went  along  with  what  she  wanted,  but  I  had  a

                       feeling that I wasn't allowed to see if it would work for the students. As a result, I was

                       limited to visual presentations due to her statement that I needed to use the weekly


                       time  frame  properly  according  to  each  topic.  So,  I  merely  made  breakrooms  for

                       groups  to  study  and  learn  the  LMS.  I  utilized  and  implemented  it  in  my  lesson

                       delivery only to have a better understanding of how it consumes time. Since my CT

                       stated that the topic, I must discuss must adhere to the MELC timetable, which states

                       that  January  5 falls  under Quarter  3  week  1,  the  topic  for  the  final  demo  must  be


                       undefined terms. When I look at it, I'm both excited and worried since the undefined

                       term is a basic component of geometry that just serves as a foundation. I am nervous

                       that I won't be able to teach it at the critical thinking level, but since I don't have a

                       choice, I'll do my best and be creative so that the students can relate to their real-life

                       experiences. Until the last three days before Christmas vacation, I mustered the guts

                       to tell my CT that I wanted to test out the Kahoot game with the students for my final

                       demo teaching,  which I had  hoped  to  incorporate  into the  discussion.  Luckily,  she


                       agreed,  and  finally,  I  tried  it  on  the  students.  That  was  our  first  attempt,  and

                       I encountered  several  technical  difficulties  before  finally  launching  the  game.  I  felt

                       scared  to  utilize  the  activity  game  program  because  it  was  the first  time,  but  I

                       summoned bravery and overcame my fear, even though I had only tried it once. I'm

                       still  thinking  of  new  ways  to  engage  learners  in  activities  that  are  fun  for  them.  I

                       my CT and waited for feedback, but after a few days went by with no response, I

                       decided to move on to lesson plan writing. When the lesson plan is finished, I send it


                       to  my  CT,  but  I  haven't  received  any  response  yet,  so  I  keep  working  on  my

                       instructional material even though I'm not sure if it's been authorized by my CT, for

                       at the back of my mind, I will be editing it if something needs to be changed. With one

                       week  until  my  final  demo,  my  CT  asks  if  I  am  ready.  She  apologizes  for  not

                       answering  sooner  since  she  is  busy  with  other  responsibilities.  Since  I  prepared


                       everything from the lesson plan to instructional material, I said yes. Then she tells me

                       that I will demonstrate it to her, so she schedules a time that is convenient for both of

                       us. When I presented it to her, she said it was OK, and the only feedback I received

                       was  for  my  pronunciation.  I  need  to  improve  my  speaking  skills.  I  was  unhappy

                       because  it  is  one  of  my  weaknesses since  there  was  no  way  I  could  remove  the

                       identity that was already ingrained in my psyche, but since she said so, I've been

                       doing  my  best  to  learn  proper  word  usage.  She  said  I  was  required  to  modify


                       something in my lesson plan in the following days. I was shocked because I thought

                       it  was  already  OK.  However,  for  the  best  result,  I  followed  her  advice,  such  as

                       removing one of the objectives because I had four, to make it three. Then she had a

                       lot of suggestions on my lesson plan that made me too tired to edit it, even at the last

                       minute  of  my  demo.  I  feel  a  little  bit  of  frustration  because  she  wants  to  remove


                       something and then, after a little time, my daughter also wants to put it back, so there

                       was lots of trial and error, but I trust her. I did everything to make it beautiful. So, edit

                       the  lesson  plan several times,  then update the  instructional  material  as well.  I  told

                       myself about a week before the final date that I was prepared, but what happened

                       was  that  I  started  cramming.  I  spent  about  two  days  without  sleep  trying  to  finish

                       everything, but it appears that I won't be able to finish due to some adjustments. I

                       think it's just a slight adjustment, but it can't be finished, and I can feel the pressure



                                                               76]]></page><page Index="324"><![CDATA[she's  exerting  on  my  shoulder.  She,  too,  wanted  the  best  demo,  so  she  spent  so

                       much time going over everything. My CT has proved to be a true perfectionist, as she

                       strives for excellence in all she does. from the terms I employed till the end of my

                       discussion. "Your activity is OK, the concept is fine, but you must follow the DepEd


                       standard," was one of the encouraging words I heard and can't forget from her. She

                       reminded  me  that  everything  in  the  lesson  plan,  including  the  questions, must  be

                       addressed, and discussed with the students, and I kept that in mind. So, the last time

                       we practiced, she stated that I was ready since everything had been polished as she

                       listened  to  me  when  I delivered  it  to  her.  I  feel  confident,  though  I


                       experienced sleepless nights. When the big day arrives, I'm torn between wanting to

                       be the greatest on this day and hoping that my CT's efforts will be repaid, because I

                       know how much she helped me. How she goes above and beyond to make this day

                       possible.

                              About 5 minutes after I began teaching, I got a text from my CT stating that

                       my  voice  is  lagging,  so I  am  distracted.  This  is the  uncontrollable  situation  of  my

                       internet connection. I was hoping that the internet would be functional for the duration


                       of the demonstration. Despite receiving comments, I believe the good side is that if I

                       am  not  disconnected,  I  must  continue  and  be unaffected.  The  presentation  began

                       with a prayer, greetings, checking attendance, a recap of the prior topic, classroom

                       rules, and then a motivator, in which I used the Kahoot software, a learning game

                       app in which students answer questions as rapidly as they can to gain the greatest


                       score and be ranked first. The students say they appreciate the motivating activity,

                       but the timing puts them under pressure, causing them to become excited when they

                       answer. I utilized a visual presentation that was also tied to their real-life experiences

                       to  grab  the  learners'  attention  and  make  it  relevant  to  their  lives.  The  topic  was

                       discussed to have a better understanding of it. The audiovisual I used before moving

                       on to the final topic, and there is also a hands-on activity where I let the students use

                       real things, they found around them during the group's activity. They'll be able to tie it



                                                               77]]></page><page Index="325"><![CDATA[to their personal experiences with the assistance of a visual depiction. Since I only

                       divided the students into three groups out of 29 total, they spent the lecture in large

                       groups  to  allow  them  to  brainstorm  their  ideas  at  the  same  time  as  completing

                       individual  tasks.  Individual  learning  occurred  concurrently  with  notetaking,  as  I


                       prompted them to take down important details while viewing the video. The students

                       were  assessed  using  both  formal  and  informal  methods.  formal  in  the  sense  that

                       each  planned  individual  task  was  evaluated,  and  the  results  were  collated  and

                       documented  once they were  all  handed  in. Informal  assessment  in the  sense that

                       students were watched throughout each activity to see how they behaved throughout


                       the  teaching  and  learning  process.  I  also  used  open-ended  questions  and  verbal

                       assessments, such as during the students' recitation while the discussion was taking

                       place.  I  wrap  up  the  class  with  a  recap  of  the  lecture,  enabling  students  to  ask

                       questions and collect unfinished tasks such as the exam and homework. I present an

                       enrichment activity for the learners that will be gathered according to their spare time

                       due to the evident concern about the internet connection while also sharing gadgets

                       from their siblings. They are graded based on how many correct items they receive.


                       This lesson will lay a solid foundation for pupils to understand future concepts that

                       may be more difficult and sophisticated. This will be a major help in linking the new

                       knowledge, especially as my students' ability to understand each topic varies greatly.

                              Since I instantly obtained pre-feedback from my CT and the panelist after the

                       demo, I believed I was effective in this demo teaching. I was told that the exercise


                       fulfills the learners' critical thinking and that I have good classroom management. I

                       have excellent voice control, which is important for students to follow, and I also have

                       a pleasant personality, which is vital when dealing with students to establish dignity

                       while engaging with them. During the post-conference, I received positive feedback,

                       such as "I have a mastery of the concepts, mastery of the LMS, I am well prepared,

                       and  I  have  set  my  standards,"  but  there  was  also  feedback  that  taught  me  to

                       reconsider,  such  as  from  Sir  Micheal  Aquino  about  "giving  no  reaction  when  the



                                                               78]]></page><page Index="326"><![CDATA[students are concerned about the internet connection." I might neglect it, but during a

                       normal discussion, I always reassure the students that everything is OK, that they

                       can  refresh  their  devices,  and  that  they  need  not  be  worried  because  the  LMS

                       records the entire conversation. This was also addressed during my demonstration.


                       However,  it  may  not  have  been  enough.  It  reminds  me  that  teaching  is  a  total

                       package;  it's  not  only  about  presenting  effectively  or  having  a  flawless  flow  of

                       conversation, but also about addressing the students' problems and feelings. We are

                       not just giving knowledge, but also developing personalities. We need to demonstrate

                       to  the  kids  that  they  are  valued,  and  we  need  to  reassure  them  that  technical


                       difficulties  will  not  impair  their  grades.  The  second  area  in  which  I  feel  I  have

                       succeeded is the students' performance, specifically how students collaborate during

                       open-ended questions or recitation while also receiving individual evaluation results

                       at  the  end  of  the  lesson.  Almost  everyone  has  earned  high  marks  thus  far  after

                       reviewing their activities. The third element is my self-evaluation. I feel satisfied with

                       my performances; I have had no conflicts or issues during the approach, so I am glad

                       for  it;  it  makes  me  happy  and  content.  With  a  few  minor  glitches,  I  was  able  to


                       complete  it.  The  students  got  along  swimmingly.  If  we  engage  in  the work  with  a

                       heart, every effort we put in, every sleepless night throughout the preparation will pay

                       off.  When  you  receive  positive  comments  and  encouragement,  the  sacrifices  are

                       forgotten. We will also achieve genuine success if we surround ourselves with the

                       right people, listening to and absorbing all their ideas, information, and wisdom. We


                       just remember that "Success is no accident." It is hard work, perseverance, learning,

                       studying, sacrifice, and most of all, love of what you are doing or learning to do. by

                       and  that  it  will  serve  as  a  solid  foundation  upon  which  I  may  build  greater

                       professional  progress  and  where  I  can  impart  it  to  individuals  I  encounter  in  the

                       future.

                                  I felt apprehensive on my first day of student teaching since I didn't know

                       how I would cope every time I had to face my schedule, especially since the school

                       utilized  a  different  LMS.  I  was  having  trouble  navigating  the  LMS.  I'm  afraid  of


                       exploring, especially when I'm among students. Throughout the observation, I was

                       conversing  with  my  microphone  on,  which  was  one  of  the  most  memorable  and

                       embarrassing things that happened. Then the CT asked whether I had any trouble in

                       the  middle  of  the  conversation.  I  occasionally  press  the  raised  hand  button  by

                       accident. Then, when the teaching was turned over to me in the lesson delivery, I


                       was  embarrassed  because  I  didn't  know  how  to  erase  the  visual  board  with

                       illustrations such as photographs, screenshots, and shapes that the students used

                       while  presenting  their  work,  but  happily,  I  was  able  to  overcome  it.  My  CT gives

                       feedback  on  the  important  topics  that  need  to  be  addressed at  the  end  of every

                       discussion. She also pays attention to my needs and provides materials that will help

                       me teach more successfully, such as how to utilize the learning management system

                       (LMS). She is willing to go above and  beyond, when necessary, which makes me


                       proud of her. I am fortunate to have a CT like Ms. Rea Olleres.

                                  I'm having trouble coping with my situation since I need to spend a lot of

                       money  on  online  gadgets  that  are  very  relevant  to  my  teaching,  particularly  in

                       computation, to have convenient teaching. I also must purchase a good quality web

                       camera  with  a  USB  port  and  lights  just  to  be  presentable  to  them,  which  initially


                       caused me pressure because it could result in budget cuts for the family, but luckily, I

                       received some scholarship fees from various organizations, which helped to alleviate

                       the financial burden. After I got through it all, my CT told me about the noises in the

                       background, such as a dog, chickens, children, and so on. I was also worried about

                       how I was going to get through it all. The experience of my first months as a student-

                       teacher was dismal, and I can say that it was far from ideal, but I felt that, little by

                       little, I would overcome it until I was able to enjoy my teaching process. When the



                                                               80]]></page><page Index="328"><![CDATA[time  came  for  me  to  deal  with  the  predicament  I  was  in,  I  began  to  form  positive

                       relationships with the students. There was some hesitation at first, and I felt a lot of

                       uneasiness throughout our interaction, but I was extremely pleased with the students

                       I  worked  with  because,  despite  their  reservations,  they  welcomed  you  with  open


                       arms. Every time I give the lesson, I see some people raising their hands and waiting

                       to  be  called.  They  perceive  me  as  their  instructor.  I  began  to  appreciate  them.  I

                       missed  their  smiles,  which  I  typically  observed  whenever  I  complimented  them  for

                       their  participation,  and  I  missed  instructing  and  engaging  with  them  when a  long

                       weekend  or  holiday  passed  by.  They  treated  me  with  such  respect.  Even  though


                       certain students are difficult to let them follow the deadline for activity submission and

                       occasionally go over your patience limit, I am still determined to deal with them. Even

                       when I am dealing with difficulties, I've managed to always look on the bright side.

                       Look for the silver lining and give credit to the students who worked so hard and were

                       responsible in their tasks when it came to dealing with student personalities. I also

                       must deal with other obstacles in the classroom, such as how I talk; my CT always

                       reminds me of my pronunciation. She tells me to do my best to be extremely cautious


                       because if I don't, this will become my identity. I usually try to be extremely careful

                       about  it,  even  if  there  have  been  moments  when  I  have  mentioned  terms  having

                       incorrect  diction  without  recognizing  it.  I'm  embarrassed  about  it,  but  I'm  getting

                       better and want to get rid of it for good. I felt I could since I've seen a lot of folks in

                       similar situations who are also excellent speakers.


                                  When  I  was  nearing  the  end  of  my  student  teaching  experience,  I

                       encountered my first heartbreak as a teacher. I am sad every time it crosses my mind

                       that I will no longer be teaching my first student. It's tough to say goodbye to your first

                       learners. When I told the kids that it was my final day with them, my eyes welled up

                       with tears. I can see the sadness in every student's eyes. I think I made an impact on

                       them  over  that  little  period.  They  are  unable  to  get  messages  from  me,  such  as

                       "Keep it up, Congratulations, just keep trying, continue to make your parents proud" if



                                                               81]]></page><page Index="329"><![CDATA[they receive a good grade on my assessment. They can't hear a word from me that

                       duration. The coordinator, CT, and students have all been  helpful in facilitating my

                       journey. I learned to be imaginative when there was a discussion among the students

                       on a topic, I was teaching them. I enhance my concept by carefully selecting each


                       activity I provide to the learners. I investigate a variety of things, such as visual and

                       auditory displays, learning games, and other activities that can help me give high-

                       quality information to a wide range of learners. When it comes to selecting resources

                       from various websites, I've grown quite cautious. I became more mindful of my words

                       and  chose  them  carefully  while  speaking  to  the  students.  The  positive  input  I

                       received from my supervisors strengthened my ideas and personality. I've learned to

                       be aware  of  how  I  react to  any  scenario  that  isn't  essential.  My  confidence  was


                       strengthened  by  my  CT's  compliments  every  time  she  entrusted  me  with  a

                       responsibility that required me to respond promptly and on time. I've made significant

                       progress in areas such as personality, and I've learned that genuine concern for your

                       kids  is  required.  My  performance  was  deemed  a  successful  teaching  experience

                       since  it  was  demonstrated  at  the  final  demo, at  which  I  received  a  lot  of  positive


                       feedback from my CT and panelist. My CT kept track of the tasks I did every day. I

                       am a responsible and resourceful student who she can rely on, especially when she

                       is having challenges. She is thankful to me since my efforts resulted in a reduction in

                       her burden. She had fewer obligations and a less rigorous schedule when I started

                       my practice teaching. I always hear from her that she has become less stressed and

                       more good-looking because of my daily contributions, and this has given me a big

                       smile on my face and even in my heart since I have provided value to my mentor and



                                                               82]]></page><page Index="330"><![CDATA[have left an essential mark on her heart. The statements of the panelists were so

                       encouraging that they bolstered my confidence. I rebuilt it and discovered that I could

                       work as a teacher. It encourages me to dream big and try new things to get closer to

                       my passion. I also learned that nothing is impossible when you put God first in all you


                       do. Even if several problems were racing to block the route so that you would not be

                       a  part  of  where  you  are  today,  your  life's  destinations  will  never  alter.  My

                       comprehension was extended, and my viewpoint was broadened. I've learned that

                       there  is  a  purpose  for  everything,  so  you  must  exercise  extreme  caution  when

                       dealing  with  the  students'  emotions  since  you  are  not  only  developing  their


                       knowledge but also their personalities. We're there to help them, to guide them in the

                       correct  direction  as much  as  possible,  so  leave your emotions  aside  and  focus  on

                       the responsibilities anchored to your profession.

                                  The  most  essential  lesson  I  learned  was  that  I  must  always  act  with

                       dignity in front of my students as well as in front of individuals I have never met and

                       who do not know me personally yet. I believe that I must be a source of inspiration for

                       young  people.  I  must  provide  hope  to  those  who  have  lost  hope.  I  must  be  a


                       motivator for people who are down and out. I was once reminded of this saying, "The

                       mediocre  teacher  tells."  The  good  teacher  explains.  The  superior  teacher

                       demonstrates the great teacher inspires by: William A. Ward and I want to be great

                       teachers in the future. I want to be a good leader for those who have put their faith in

                       me and my capacity to succeed. I must plant this saying in my heart: "Great leaders


                       harness  personal  courage,  capture  the  hearts  and  minds  of  others,  and  empower

                       new leaders to make the world a better place. (“Quotes Inspirational Leadership”) —

                       Maxine Driscoll, when everything else is going on, the thing that I wish not to lose is

                       humility.  May  God  keep  putting  my  feet  on  the  ground.  It's my  biggest fear,  but I

                       believe that whenever you want something strongly right, none of it is impossible.

                       Dear Readers,

                              This portfolio is a summary of my entire practice teaching experience at Dawn

                       Amadis Christian School, Inc.

                              Through this portfolio, you will be able to learn about my expectations for my

                       students,  cooperating  teacher/school,  and  student  teaching,  as  well  as  what  I

                       observed from students at various levels during our observation week. It will give you


                       an idea of how to prepare and get ready for actual teaching as a student teacher, as

                       well  as  how  to  adapt  the  instructional  methods  of  the  cooperating  school  during

                       online classes.

                              Reading this portfolio will give you information about a student teacher's day-

                       to-day life. It discusses common classroom problems that you may face in the future


                       and  provides  suggestions  for  how  to  solve  those  problems.  It  also  discusses  my

                       experiences  during  my  final  demonstration  teaching  and  what  I  did  to  make  it  a

                       success. Lastly, you will learn about my overall reflections and self-assessment of my

                       own learning and insights on student teaching.

                              In  the  last  part  of  this  portfolio,  you  will  be  able  to  see  figures  as

                       documentation  from  my  entire  internship,  and  my  lesson  plan  in  my  final

                       demonstration  teaching  and  PowerPoint  presentation  that  I  used  during  class


                       discussion, including the references that I used in creating this portfolio.

                              This portfolio will inspire you to pursue your dreams and goals in life; it will

                       show you that there is always a way around every obstacle, and even if things do not

                       always go as planned, God will help you find a way. Let us look back at my amazing

                       journey. Happy reading!

                                  EXPECTATION ON THE STUDENT TEACHING PROGRAM





                              Expectation!  Through  expectation,  we  can  sometimes  cause  our  own

                       heartbreak (Lethbridge, n.d.). Related to this, there is no wrong with expecting the

                       causes heartbreak, it allows us to learn from the unexpected.

                       the same respect they do to their teachers. I expect them to be on time and to always


                       participate in our class discussions, and I also expect them to follow our classroom

                       rules  even  if  I  am  not  their  actual  teacher.  I  hope  they  are  all  courteous  and

                       respectful and that they will enjoy our class discussion.  I am worried that because

                       they are in a private school, they will be so smart and intelligent that they will put my

                       abilities as their teacher to the test, and I know that as a student-teacher I will learn

                       from them.


                              And as for my cooperating teacher, I expect to learn from her and hope she

                       enjoys  having  me  as  her  student  teacher.  I  hope  she  can  demonstrate  her

                       capabilities as my cooperating teacher, and that the distance between us will not be

                       a hindrance to our having a good relationship. I anticipate her introducing me to their

                       classroom routines and instructional materials, as well as giving me opportunities to

                       observe and participate in their various classes. I hope she will willingly help me with


                       how to make a daily lesson plan and give me ideas on how to teach mathematics in

                       an online setting. I expect that she will have trust in my ability to properly teach her

                       students, and that I will be able to learn how to create quizzes, exams, and activities,

                       as  well  as  how  to  check  them.  I  also  wanted  to  know  how  she  calculated  her

                       students'  grades;  hopefully,  she  will  teach  me  this.  And  I  expect  my  cooperating

                       school to support me and give me what I need while taking this internship.]]></page><page Index="415"><![CDATA[2


                              I am really looking forward to this student teaching program because I believe

                       it will teach me how to be a great teacher someday. This course will provide me with

                       the opportunity to gain direct experience teaching students and to learn strategies for

                       teaching mathematics in an online class and in face-to-face classes. This is what I


                       want  to  know  as  of  now,  since  the  mode  of  learning  is  an  online  setting:  what

                       teaching methods did the math teacher use to discuss the math lessons during online

                       class?  I  am  excited  to  learn  about  those  methods.  Throughout  this  journey,  I  am

                       confident  that  I  will  learn  a  wide  variety  of  strategies  for  teaching  various  math

                       lessons. I presume that I will encounter issues involving my students, and I hope that


                       I will be able to manage them with the assistance of my cooperating teacher.

                              I know it will be difficult to be a student-teacher; I know it will be hard to deal

                       with different students every day; I know there will be challenges, but I believe it will

                       help shape me into a good teacher. There are lessons to be learn and tears to be

                       shed, but the important thing is that I learned from those experiences and know how

                       to stand and fight for my dreams. As a student teacher, I hope for the best, brace

                       myself for the worst, and prepare to be surprised.]]></page><page Index="416"><![CDATA[3


                                        REFLECTION IN CLASSROOM OBSERVATION



                              As a student-teacher, one of my commitments is to observe the classroom for

                       one  week  before  deploying  in  the  actual  field  of  teaching.  During  this  time,  my


                       cooperating  school  allowed  me  to  observe  my  cooperating  teacher's  class

                       discussions  with  students  of  various  levels.  My  cooperating  teacher  sent  a  link  of

                       Google  Meet  in  their  Facebook  Messenger  group  chat,  and  students  will  join  in

                       Google Meet. I sat in on all her synchronous classes and took notes on everything I

                       had seen.


                              The first thing I noticed was that my cooperating teacher used the whiteboard

                       to discuss the lesson and show solutions to the given problem while also presenting

                       the  lesson  in  class.  She  informed  me  that  it  is  the  best  way  to  help  her  students

                       understand  the  lesson.  Previously,  she  used  a  PowerPoint  presentation  only  to

                       discuss the lesson, but she discovered that it was ineffective for the students. I am so

                       impressed that it looks like you are in a face-to-face class, with the teacher writing

                       everything  on  the  board  while  discussing  the  lesson.  However,  the  difference


                       between  face-to-face  classes  and  online  classes  is  that  her  students  will  not  be

                       present in the actual classroom. Therefore, I decided to buy a whiteboard, as I do not

                       have  one.  It  is  nice  that  it  is  less  expensive  than  a  pen  and  pad;  in  comparison,

                       others  in  the  online  class  used  a  pen  and  pad  while  discussing  the  lesson  in  a

                       PowerPoint presentation.


                              Concerning the classroom routines, I noticed that they only do the prayer in

                       the first class of the day, and the rest of the classes only say greetings to each other.

                       I am simply curious, and I would like to know why. For me, it is essential that before

                       we begin our class discussion, we always pray for wisdom and knowledge, as well as

                       to  remind  them  that  there  is  a  God.  That  is  why,  if  the  day  comes  when  I  am  a

                       teacher, I will begin the class with a prayer. My cooperating teacher demonstrated

                       her  authority  as  a  teacher  by  instructing  her  students  to  open  their  cameras]]></page><page Index="417"><![CDATA[4


                       whenever  she  did  not  see  them  on  her  monitor  and  by  reminding  her  students  to

                       mute their microphones if students forgot to mute and made a noise in class. She

                       instructs students to raise their hands and unmute their microphones if they wish to

                       respond to something or clarify something. Therefore, I admire her authority; I have


                       seen how all her students obeyed her. I realized that as a teacher, it is important that

                       I demonstrate authority to earn the students' respect. I also noticed that she keeps

                       calling on her students to participate in class discussions and allowing them to share

                       their ideas. If students refuse to participate, she inquires as to why. Based on what I

                       have  observed,  I  have  learned  that  it  is  my  responsibility  to  keep  encouraging


                       students to participate in class discussions to determine whether they have learned

                       from the lesson. And, according to my cooperating teacher, it is essential that I treat

                       all my students equally, to instill in them the concept that they are all important to me.

                       I made a promise to treat all my students equally because I know what it is like to feel

                       unappreciated as a student. When I was in high school, I had a teacher who had a

                       favorite  student.  She  skewed  in  her  grading  and  did  not  value  the  work  of  other

                       students. And for attendance, the cooperating teacher reminds her students not to


                       leave  the  classroom  after  the  discussion  so  that  a  picture  can  be  take  of  those

                       students who attended the class.

                              In  terms  of  the  classroom  environment,  I  noticed  that  my  cooperating

                       teacher's  background  was  noisy,  possibly  because  her  co-teachers  were  also

                       discussing the lesson at the same time and in the same place. As a result, if I were a


                       student, I would struggle to understand what she was saying because I could also

                       hear the voices of other teachers. The background noise was distracting.  I am not

                       sure  if  she  was  aware  of  it.  Fortunately,  the  students  are  aware  of  the  classroom

                       rules, which state that they should only unmute their microphones when responding

                       to or clarifying something about the lesson. I also noticed that all her students were

                       respectful and polite. They respect each other even at the lower levels of students,

                       and  it  is  amazing  that  even  at  such  an  early  age,  they  know  how  to  attend  class]]></page><page Index="418"><![CDATA[5


                       properly. When it comes to interaction, few of grade levels, particularly Grades 9 and

                       10, have interactive class discussions. While other grade levels, such as grades 6, 7,

                       and  8,  have  a  lack  of  interaction  because  mostly  of  the  students  do  not  want  to

                       participate, the cooperating teacher is the only one who keeps talking to the rest of


                       the class. In this setting, I observed a positive and healthy relationship between the

                       teacher  and  the  students,  which  is  beneficial  in  creating  a  conducive  learning

                       environment in online settings.

                              Since I noticed that they did not implement all classroom routines that I had

                       learned in my previous subject, I asked about the lesson plan after observation. I am


                       genuinely surprised that they did not create a lesson plan for the lessons. From what

                       I  have  learned,  it  is  necessary  to  generate  a  lesson  plan  before  creating  a

                       PowerPoint  presentation.  They  told  me  that  in  private  school,  the  most  important

                       thing is to master the lessons and use a PowerPoint presentation to present them to

                       the  class.  Therefore,  as  I  observed,  they  did  not  conduct  any  activities  prior  to

                       discussing the lessons, claiming that the allotted time was insufficient to cover all the

                       lessons if they followed the flow of the lesson plan. Math subjects always consume a


                       time,  so  to  prioritize  the  lesson;  they  must  discuss  the  lesson  and  conduct  an

                       individual  activity  if  there  is  any  remaining  time.  I  am  surprised, but I  respect  their

                       perceptions,  and as a  student-teacher,  I must  follow  what  they  implement as  their

                       classroom routines, so I take note that I do not need to create a lesson plan, only a

                       presentation, and then ensure that the lesson discussed in the allotted time. No need


                       other activities for motivation, just a quick review of the previous lesson is enough.


                              In  terms  of  assessment,  my  cooperating  teacher  assesses  her  students'

                       learning  through  recitation,  activities,  quizzes,  long  tests,  and  periodic  tests.  The

                       student's participation in class discussions serves as their recitation, and their grades

                       are based on their performance. The activities completed during the remaining class

                       time and submitted via private message on Facebook Messenger. It is important to]]></page><page Index="419"><![CDATA[6


                       announce that there will be a quiz to allow students time to prepare before taking the

                       quiz, which will take during the online class. The quiz must have fifteen items, and it

                       is up to me to design a quiz based on the lessons. The long test had thirty items and

                       was multiple choice, whereas the periodic test had fifty items and was also multiple


                       choice; both tests will take online.


                              My cooperating teacher informed me that the students would submit a picture

                       of their work individually, and she would check it by editing the picture and returning

                       the graded and recorded work to the students. At this point, I felt confused as to why


                       students  will  have  to  submit  it  individually  via  private  message  on  Facebook

                       Messenger. Why can't they use Google Classroom instead? For me, it is preferable

                       that they use Google Classroom to organize all the students' records. It is not difficult

                       to check the work of students and to be transparent with both the teacher and the

                       students.  Anyway,  Google  Classroom  is  popular  nowadays,  and  it  used  by  both

                       public and private schools. But, once again, I respect them; I know they have their


                       own reasons and goals for everything they do in school. They consider their students'

                       capabilities; mostly of them have poor internet connections or prefer to use Facebook

                       Messenger.  On  the  other  hand,  there  is  one  thing  that  I  really  admire  about  my

                       cooperating teacher when it comes to assessing students: if her students still do not

                       understand the lesson and mostly of them are still asking for clarification, she insists

                       on repeating the lesson rather than moving on to the next lesson. She will only move


                       on to the next lesson if everyone is able to answer her questions and participate in

                       class discussions.


                              Observing the classroom in an online setting is amazing; I am grateful to my

                       cooperating  school  for  allowing  me  to  conduct  my  internship  at  their  school.  I  am


                       looking  forward  to  my  journey  as  a  student-teacher,  and  I  am  confident  that

                       everything  will  be  fine,  especially  in  relation  to  my  future  students.  I  need  to  be

                       prepared for the students in the upper grade levels who are always participating in]]></page><page Index="420"><![CDATA[7


                       class discussions and who are constantly asking for clarification because, based on

                       my observations, there are students were asking questions that were not always part

                       of the actual discussion. And I need to do something about the grade levels that are

                       not  participating  in  class  discussions;  I  need  to  know  if  they  are  just  too  shy  to


                       participate  or  if  they  did  not  learn  anything  from  the  lesson.  It  is  important  that  I

                       recognize their strengths and weaknesses to teach them effectively. I need to think of

                       motivation, or I need to conduct the lesson that they have enjoyed. I had a wonderful

                       time observing the Grade 4 and Grade 3 students' classes. They are ridiculously cute

                       and  courteous.  They  are  fantastic,  especially  when  they  respond  to  questions


                       presented by my cooperating teacher. They were not shy and smiling at the cameras.

                       I really want to teach them, but since I am only at secondary level, it is impossible for

                       me to manage  them.  I  assume  my  cooperating teacher  will  assign me  to a  higher

                       level.

                              After observing all my cooperating teacher's classes,  I am really impressed

                       with her;  I am  curious about how  she  manages those different  students  at  distinct

                       levels. Every class discussion, I observed the changes in her mood and approach to


                       the  students.  I am  also  intrigued  by how  she prepared  all  the  lessons  she  will  be

                       discussing every day.  I am grateful for the opportunity to  observe her classes and

                       look  forward  to  developing  a  positive  relationship  with  her.  I  hope  I  can  fulfill  her

                       requests.  I  am  hoping  and  praying  that  my  journey  as  a  student-teacher  will  be

                       successful with the assistance of my cooperating teacher and cooperating school.]]></page><page Index="421"><![CDATA[8


                              SELF-ASSESSMENT ON READINESS IN THE ACTUAL TEACHING



                              As  a  student  teacher  pursuing  a  Bachelor  of  Secondary  Education  with  a

                       major in Mathematics, I am eager to teach math lessons, and it is the subject that I


                       must master. Since my  cooperating teacher assigns me to Grade 9 and Grade 10

                       students  for  their  math  class,  I  am  already  familiar  with  my  students'  abilities  and

                       attitudes based on what I observed them doing last week. I must use a whiteboard

                       and a whiteboard marker to demonstrate the lesson. I will use my phone to show the

                       solutions on the board and my laptop for presenting the lesson, which requires an


                       internet connection.

                              I informed that I would require to teach them every Monday and Wednesday

                       for one hour only. Students in grade 9 will begin at 7:00 a.m. and must end at 8:00

                       a.m., while students in grade 10 will begin at 8:15 a.m. and must end at 9:15 a.m. To

                       motivate  and  pique  their  interest  in  the  lesson,  I  must  begin  the  discussion  by

                       reviewing  the  previous  lesson  and  then  proceed  to  the  new  topic  while  using  an

                       attractive  virtual  PowerPoint presentation  and  whiteboard.  I  must  be energetic  and


                       always encourage students to participate in our class discussion to have interaction

                       and keep them focused on the lesson. For classroom management, I must ask them

                       to open their camera and mute their microphone, and they may raise their hand if

                       they wish to respond. Understanding of the content is important, so I must study the

                       lessons  from  their  book  and  the  internet  and  be  prepared  for  clarification  and


                       inquiries from my students. After discussion, I must assign them an individual activity

                       that they must complete and submit by the end of the class. Students will answer the

                       questions and ask for clarification during the discussion as a formative assessment.

                       Every  topic  we  discussed  requires  the  preparation  of  fifteen  items  for  a  quiz.  The

                       student's  response  will  inform  me  if  I  was  successful  in  teaching  the  lesson.  It  is

                       critical that students achieve their learning objectives and develop their 21st century

                       skills.]]></page><page Index="422"><![CDATA[9

                       Day 1: 04 October 2021

                              What an exciting day it is to begin my internship as a student teacher! It was


                       the first day of our observation week, and I was excited. My cooperating teacher, Ms.

                       Loraine Oblipias, instructs me to attend her classes for the day. I attended her first

                       synchronous class from 7:00 a.m. to 8:00 a.m. with Grade 9 students. Ma'am Loraine

                       reviewed  the  previous  lesson  with  the  students  to  ensure  that  they  understood  it

                       completely. Students were actively participating, while others were dozing off. I have


                       noticed that she was using a white board to show the solutions to the problem and

                       keeps on asking if the students understand the lesson.

                              After her class with Grade 9 students, I attended her synchronous class with

                       Grade 10 students. I observed that students were actively participating in their class

                       discussion. I have noticed one of her students always keeps on asking and clarifying

                       something, showing his interest in the lesson. After observing the Grade 10 students,

                       I realized that I had to be prepared if my cooperating teacher assigned me to teach


                       them.

                              At  3:30  p.m.,  I  attended  online  orientation  with  our  coordinator,  Mr.

                       Christopher  Lim.  He  told  us  that  we  must  first  observe  my  cooperating  teacher’s

                       classes  to  familiarize  ourselves  with  how  she  facilitates  learning  in  synchronous

                       classes with various levels of students.]]></page><page Index="423"><![CDATA[10




                       Day 2: 05 October 2021

                              It  was my  second  day of  classroom  observation,  and  from 7:00  a.m.  From

                       7:00  a.m.  to  8:00  a.m.,  I  attended  my  cooperating  teacher's  grade  7  students'


                       synchronous  class.  As  a  teacher,  I  have  learned  that  I  must  clearly  explain  the

                       lesson. I have noticed that students are not taking part in the class discussion.

                              I  attended  my  cooperating  teacher's  grade  8  students'  synchronous  class

                       from  8:15  to  9:15  a.m.  When  students  did  not  understand  the  lesson,  they  were

                       honest and politely requested a repetition of the discussion, and from 12:00 p.m. to


                       1:00  p.m.,  I attended  her  synchronous  class  with  Grade 6  students.  I  noticed  that

                       students  are  paying  attention  to  the  lesson;  they  are  all  actively  participating  and

                       showing  interest  in  it.  I  attended  my  cooperating  teacher's  Grade  5  students'

                       synchronous class from 1:15 to 2:15 p.m. As a teacher,  I have noticed that I must

                       constantly  call  for  their  attention  and  explain  the  lesson  clearly  and  slowly  for

                       students to understand it.

                              Lastly, I attended orientation with Ma'am Loraine Oblipias from 2:16 to 3:00


                       p.m. She advised us that the important thing is to teach the students about what and

                       how  we  understand  the  lesson  in  an  effortless  way  and  to  always  repeat  the

                       discussion if students are still confused and do not understand the lesson yet. Then,

                       following the discussion, I must assign an activity to assess the students' learning.

                       She  also  reminded  me  that  quizzes  must  announced  and  that  when  creating  a


                       PowerPoint  presentation,  the  font  size  should  be  32–40  to  ensure  that  it  was

                       readable and visible. Ma'am Loraine assigned me to Grade 4 students for my first

                       demo teaching with the topic "estimating the products of 3-to 4-digit numbers by 2-to

                       3-digit numbers." I must create a lesson plan and PowerPoint presentation for this

                       topic by  Monday  and submit  it  to  Ma'am Loraine  for  checking.  This demonstration

                       teaching will assist her in determining which grade level she will assign to me.]]></page><page Index="424"><![CDATA[11


                       Day 3: 06 October 2021

                              My third day of classroom observation has arrived. I get up early and check

                       my  laptop to  see  if  the  wired  connection  I  installed  is  functional.  I must  spend  the

                       entire day observing my cooperating teacher's class.


                              First,  from  7:00  a.m.  to  8:00  a.m.,  I  attended  my  cooperating  teacher's

                       synchronous class for Grade 9 students. They talk about how to solve problems with

                       inequalities. I noticed that the students were friendly and helpful. They are actively

                       engaged in class discussion. Then, from 8:15 to 9:15 a.m., I attended my cooperating

                       teacher's synchronous class for Grade 10 students. There will be a quiz, and Ma'am


                       Loraine will allow students to review before the quiz. While taking the quiz, students

                       always  ask  for  clarification.  I  attended  my  cooperating  teacher's  grade  4  students'

                       synchronous class from 12:00 p.m. to 1:00 p.m. The entire time, students were taking

                       their quiz. I have noticed that students frequently seek clarification while taking the

                       quiz.  Finally,  from  1:15  to  2:15  p.m.,  I  attended  a  synchronous  class  with  my

                       cooperating teacher's Grade 3 students. They are sweet and polite. They took part in

                       the  class  discussion.  I  am  so  impressed  that,  despite  their  age,  they  can  follow


                       classroom rules, mute their microphones when the teacher is talking, and raise their

                       hand before answering a question. They are such cute and adorable students.]]></page><page Index="425"><![CDATA[12


                       Day 4: 07 October 2021

                              It is my fourth day of classroom observation, and I have been there since 7:00

                       a.m. I had a synchronous class with my cooperating teacher's grade 7 students from

                       7:00 a.m. to 8:00 a.m. As a teacher,  I have learned that I must explain the lesson


                       clearly  and  always  encourage  my  students  to  participate  in  class  discussions,

                       especially those who did not raise their hands to answer but instead silently listened

                       to the teacher. Starting at 8:15 a.m., I attended an online class for my CT Grade 8

                       students from 8:15 a.m. to 9:15 a.m. I noticed that the students were struggling with

                       word  problems  and  needed  more  examples  to  grasp  the  lesson.  My  cooperating


                       teacher  provided  more  examples  and  slowed  down  the  discussion.  I  attended  her

                       online class with Grade 9 students from 9:15 a.m. to 10:15 a.m. It was a continuation

                       of their previous lesson. A special student, Erick Paolo Santos, caught my attention.

                       He kept saying words that I did not understand while my cooperating teacher was

                       discussing  the  lesson,  so  she  told  him  to  mute  his  microphone,  and  Kuya  Paolo

                       apologized to my CT before turning off his microphone. I felt relieved that, despite

                       being a special student, he immediately followed his teacher. I thought it was difficult


                       to deal with him.

                              I  attended  my  cooperating  teacher's  grade  6  students'  synchronous  class

                       from 12:00 p.m. to 1:00 p.m. They are taking their test. I noticed that students were

                       constantly seeking clarification. As a teacher,  I have learned that I must be patient

                       with these students and explain the direction of the quiz clearly. I also attended an


                       online class of my CT in Grade 5 students from 1:15 to 2:15 p.m. As a teacher,  I

                       have  noticed  that  I  must  constantly  call  students'  attention  and  explain  the  lesson

                       clearly and slowly for them to understand it. When the teacher calls their name, they

                       actively participate. After observing  various levels of classes, I was impressed with

                       my  cooperating  teacher's  handling  of  those  different  students.  I  noticed  that  she

                       approached her students differently depending on their ages.]]></page><page Index="426"><![CDATA[13


                       Day 5: 08 October 2021

                                     Today is Friday, and my cooperating teacher has asked me to prepare

                       a  lesson  plan  and  PowerPoint  presentation  for  my  demo  teaching  on  Monday

                       because  she  does  not  have  a  math  lesson  scheduled  for  today.  When  my


                       cooperating teacher sends me a lesson about estimating the products of 3-to 4-digit

                       numbers  by  2-to  3-digit  numbers,  I  will  start  working  on  my  lesson  plan  for  it.

                       Because it is all about estimating the products, my first activity was to estimate the

                       number of apples in the basket. Teaching grade 4 students was challenging for me,

                       so  I  had to  produce activities  in  which my  students  could participate  and  increase


                       their interest in the lesson. I remembered that at their age, they love food, especially

                       Jollibee, so for their second activity, I plan to show them pictures of Jollibee menus

                       and  ask  them  what  food  they  want  to  eat  and  how  orders  they  want,  to  get  an

                       estimated  price  for  their  order.  When  creating  a  lesson  plan,  I  realized  that  it  is

                       always difficult to think of activities that align with the objectives of the lesson while

                       also motivating students.

                              After  finishing  my  lesson  plan,  I  created  my  PowerPoint  presentation  and


                       double-checked  that  it  was  readable  and  visible.  I  designed  a  template  that  was

                       simple  and  neat  but  also  appealing  to  my  students.  I  used  animated  images  and

                       applied  simple  animations.  It  is  important  to  me  that  the  content  of  my  lesson

                       perfectly fit into every slide of my presentation by using the appropriate fonts and font

                       size. Because my first demo teaching was on Monday, I submitted my lesson plan


                       and PowerPoint presentation to my cooperating teacher for review in the evening.]]></page><page Index="427"><![CDATA[14


                       Day 6: 11 October 2021

                              My first demo teaching experience in grade 4 was observe by my cooperating

                       teacher and coordinator. I could not even sleep last night because I was so nervous

                       because it was my first-time teaching in an actual online classroom. From 12:00 p.m.


                       to 1:00 p.m., I taught Grade 4 students about estimating the products of 3-to-4-digit

                       numbers by 2-to-3-digit numbers. Unfortunately, I ran into technical difficulties, such

                       as my laptop lagging and my network being unstable enough that I  could not even

                       share  my  PowerPoint  presentation;  I  decided  to  connect  my  cell  phone  as  well  in

                       Google Meet. Fortunately, Ma'am Loraine assists me in sharing my presentation in

                       class while I am discussing it, allowing me to continue our class discussion.


                              I  attended  an  online  meeting  with  my  cooperating  teacher  and  coordinator

                       from 3:00 to 4:00 p.m. to receive feedback on my performance in my demo teaching.

                       My CT stated that I have the required energy as a teacher of grade 4 students, that I

                       conduct good activities and have a proficiency in the content, but that I have poor

                       pronunciation and reading of numbers. She advised me that when I am writing on the

                       whiteboard, I should keep my body in a side view to make it visible to my students


                       and keep an eye on the monitor to see who is raising their hand. It is also essential to

                       encourage all my students, not just few, to participate in class discussions to avoid

                       bias  and  favoritism.  She  assigned  me  to  Grade  9  and  Grade  10  students  and

                       informed me that she would send me a copy of the lesson because I needed to use

                       their book as a reference. My coordinator advised me to always make the classroom

                       environment enjoyable, teach students to love math, and have my own methods for

                       making discussions easy. I am incredibly grateful and thankful for their suggestions,


                       which will help me improve my teaching skills and have a satisfactory performance

                       someday.]]></page><page Index="428"><![CDATA[15


                       Day 7: 12 October 2021

                              It  was  the  day  my  cooperating  teacher  assigned  me  to  encode  the  first

                       periodic exam in Math 10 in Microsoft Word for Grade 10 students. I check my emails

                       first  thing  in  the  morning.  I  received  a  message  from  her  with  her  written  test


                       attached, which I downloaded onto my laptop. I used Arial fonts with a font size of

                       twelve and a paper size of A4. I noticed that the type of exam she used was multiple

                       choice,  with  only  twenty  items  having  three  choices.  This  task  is  simple  for  me

                       because  I  already  know  how  to  create  test  papers  from  our  previous  subject.  My

                       cooperating  teacher  informed  me  that  I  only  needed  to  encode  her  first  written

                       periodical exam of different grade levels in Microsoft Word this week because their


                       first periodical examination is next week.



                       Day 8: 13 October 2021

                              Today I woke up early. I immediately checked my messenger and email to

                       see if my cooperating teacher had sent me a message. I received her written test,

                       and  she  instructed  me  to  encode  the  1st  Periodical  Exam  in  Math  9  for  Grade  9


                       students in Microsoft Word. I downloaded it to my laptop. I used Arial for the fonts,

                       twelve (12) for the font size, and A4 for the paper size. I have noticed that the type of

                       exam she used was multiple choice, with only thirty (30) items having three choices. I

                       would be happy to complete the task; I really want to assist her because I know she

                       has  a  work  to  do,  especially  since  she manages  both elementary and  high  school

                       levels. I cannot imagine how difficult it must be to be a teacher. I double-checked the

                       document before sending it to ensure that my cooperating teacher was satisfied with


                       what I did.]]></page><page Index="429"><![CDATA[16


                       Day 9: 14 October 2021

                              It  was  the  day  my  cooperating  teacher  assigned  me  to  encode  the  first

                       periodic exam in Math 8 in Microsoft Word for Grade 8 students. She emailed her

                       written test to my Gmail account, which I downloaded onto my laptop. I used Arial


                       fonts with a font size of twelve (12) and a paper size of A4. I noticed that the type of

                       exam she used was multiple choice, with only thirty (30) items having three choices. I

                       was curious as to why she was not using other types of exams, such as true or false

                       and identification. On the other hand, I realized she was just following school rules or

                       giving students a chance to pass their exam because it was multiple choice. I double-


                       checked  the document  before  sending  it  to my cooperating  teacher  to  ensure  that

                       there were no errors in the test paper, and I submitted it when I finished.



                       Day 10: 15 October 2021

                              My cooperating teacher assigned me the task of encoding the first periodic

                       exam in Math 7 for grade 7 students and Math 3 for grade 3 students in Microsoft

                       Word. She emailed her written test to my Gmail account, which I downloaded onto


                       my laptop. I noticed that the type of exam she used was multiple choice with only

                       thirty items and three choices for both Grades 7 and Grade 3. I carefully encode the

                       written  exam  in  Microsoft  Word  and  occasionally  ask  my  cooperating  teacher  to

                       clarify any words that are difficult to read. I double-checked the documents to ensure

                       there  were  no  mistakes  before  submitting  them  to  my  cooperating  teacher.  I  am


                       happy that my cooperating teacher was so appreciative and satisfied with what I did.]]></page><page Index="430"><![CDATA[17


                       Day 11: 18 October 2021

                              This morning, my cooperating teacher messages me and asks if it is okay if I

                       encode the 1st Periodical Exam in MAPEH 6 in Microsoft Word, to which I replied

                       that it is fine and that I am willing to do it for her. She emailed her written test to my


                       Gmail account, which I downloaded onto my laptop. I used Arial fonts with a font size

                       of twelve (12) and a paper size of A4. I am amazed that she can manage not only

                       math  but  also  MAPEH  6.  The  periodic  test  includes  fifteen  (15)  fill-in-the-blank

                       questions  in  music,  ten  (10)  true  or  false  questions  in  art,  ten  item  identification

                       questions  in  physical  education,  and  fifteen  multiple-choice  questions  in  health.  I


                       double-checked  the  documents  to  ensure  that  they  properly  encoded  before

                       submitting them to my cooperating teacher.



                       Day 12: 19 October 2021

                              This  morning,  I  sent  a  message  to  my  cooperating  teacher,  asking  if  she

                       needed assistance or if I had anything I could do for her, and she replied that she

                       would notify me if she needed assistance. I also checked my Gmail account to see if


                       my cooperating teacher had sent me a copy of the lesson, but there was no message

                       from  her,  so  I  could  not  create  a  PowerPoint  presentation.  While  I  waited  for  her

                       instruction, I checked our research questionnaires on Google Forms and asked my

                       adviser, Ma'am Mildred, to do the same. Because my cooperating teacher had not

                       assigned me a task for the day, I decided to work on our final research paper.]]></page><page Index="431"><![CDATA[18


                        Day 13: 20 October 2021

                              This day, I waited for my cooperating teacher's instructions, but there was no

                       message at all. My cooperating teacher did not assign any tasks to me. Fortunately,

                       my  adviser  sent  me  a  message  informing  me  that  she  had  already  checked  the


                       Google form questionnaires for our research. She instructs me to write a formal letter

                       for the participants and distribute it to those who do not belong to our sample. With

                       the assistance of my classmates and fellow students, I created a formal letter for the

                       participants in our research questionnaires in Google Form and distributed the link to

                       participants.  It  is  difficult  to  ask  students  to  participate  as  our  participants,  and

                       students  refused.  Since  we  needed  thirty  (30)  participants  for  our  reliability  test,  I


                       enlisted the assistance of an old classmate who is a student at Main Campus, and

                       she promised to assist me in disseminating our Google form's link to her classmates

                       after they finished their exam.



                       Day 14: 21 October 2021

                              This morning, I sent a message to my co-student teacher, Ma'am Mary-Ann,


                       asking if our cooperating teacher had messaged her, and she replied that there had

                       been  no message  from my  cooperating  teacher.  Since  there  was  still no assigned

                       task  from  my  cooperating  teacher,  I  decided  to  check  the  responses  of  the

                       participants  for  our  reliability  test  in  Google  Form.  I  was  frustrated  that  we  only

                       received six responses from Main Campus students. Because we are not in face-to-

                       face classes, few of the students did not want to participate; they could easily decline

                       and ignore our request. I am so helpless; I am not sure how we can persuade them


                       to take part in our research.]]></page><page Index="432"><![CDATA[19


                       Day 15: 22 October 2021

                              I am having a sad day because my cooperating teacher has not assigned me

                       a  task.  I  was  curious  to  know  if  she  disliked  me  as  her  student  teacher.  I  am

                       wondering if I said or did something she did not like. I am wondering silently why she


                       did  not  let  me  observe  her  class  while  she  was  conducting  the  first  periodic

                       examination. I am interested in how they conduct their online exams, but I respect

                       her decision for not asking me to facilitate the examination. I waited all day for my

                       cooperating teacher's instruction, but there was no message.




                       Day 16: 25 October 2021

                              This  was  the  day  that I  received a  copy  of the  lesson  for  Grade 9  and 10

                       students,  and  my  cooperating  teacher  informed  me  that  I  would  be  teaching  on

                       Wednesday.  I  am  extremely  happy,  but  also  nervous.  I  made  a  PowerPoint

                       presentation  for  Grade  9  on  the  topic  of  direct  variation  because  my  cooperating

                       teacher  said  I  did  not  need  to  make  a  lesson  plan  for  it,  so  I  just  made  the

                       presentation. I studied and researched direct variation on Google while creating my


                       PowerPoint presentation, and I watched video discussions on YouTube to gain ideas

                       on how to  teach  this  lesson  in a  way  that my  students  would easily understand.  I

                       found a simple but appealing template on the internet and made sure it was readable

                       and visible by using the appropriate fonts and font size. I also included images in my

                       presentation, and to avoid lag with my device, I used simple animation, which I then


                       submitted for review to my cooperating teacher.]]></page><page Index="433"><![CDATA[20


                       Day 17: 26 October 2021

                              Today  I  woke  up  early  and  am  excited  for  my  first  synchronous  class

                       tomorrow. I used this day on creating my PowerPoint for the Circles lesson for Grade

                       10,  and  while  doing  so,  I  also  studied  and  researched  it  on  Google  and  watched


                       videos on YouTube for additional information and ideas on how to deliver this lesson

                       to my students. Because I noticed that grade 10 students were continually active and

                       always wanting to know more, I needed to be ready for them. As a teacher, I must

                       respond correctly when they ask questions about our topic. To pique their interest in

                       the lesson, I prepared a 4pic in 1 word activity. By using the appropriate fonts and


                       font  size,  I  was  able  to  make  my  PowerPoint  presentation  readable,  simple,  and

                       captivating  to  my  students.  I  have  learned  from  our  previous  subject  that  I  must

                       inform students about the lesson's learning objectives, which is why they are always

                       in my presentation. I sent the copy of my PowerPoint presentation to my cooperating

                       teacher for checking.]]></page><page Index="434"><![CDATA[21


                       Day 18: 27 October 2021

                              That is, it! It was the first day of my synchronous class with Grade 9 students

                       from 7:00 a.m. to 8:00 a.m. and Grade 10 students from 8:15 a.m. to 9:15 a.m. While

                       I waited for the Google link from my cooperating teacher, I prepared my laptop for the


                       presentation as well as my phone, where I was able to open my camera to show the

                       whiteboard.

                              My cooperating teacher introduced me to my grade 9 and grade 10 students

                       as her student-teacher, I am glad that my students welcomed me warmly. They are

                       all excited to meet me, and they are incredibly happy that I will be the one who will


                       teach them soon.

                               In Grade 9, I discussed direct variation, and in Grade 10, I discussed circles.

                       I  successfully  delivered  the  lesson  to  grade  9  students,  and  my  students  actively

                       participated in our class discussion. I finished the lesson on time, which is important

                       for me because my cooperating teacher told me before that I had to finish the lesson

                       every time, we discussed it. In Grade 10, I dissatisfied with my performance because

                       I did not sleep well last night, did not eat my breakfast this morning, and I was also


                       suffering  from  stomach  aches  because  of  the  chilly  weather.  I  am  so  weak  and

                       nervous  that  my  voice  trembles.  I  am  so  glad  they  are  participating  in  our  class

                       discussion.  Fortunately,  Ma'am  Loraine  congratulates  me  on  my  performance  and

                       instructs me to prepare an activity for my students for the next grade 9 discussions.



                              I am so happy for this day; I  cannot explain the feelings when my students

                       call me "ma’am". I found myself smiling all day. I realized that it is so good to be a

                       teacher and I felt great that they are all learning from me. I am looking forward to the


                       upcoming days and hoping to have a good day together with my cooperating teacher

                       and students.]]></page><page Index="435"><![CDATA[22


                       Day 19: 28 October 2021

                              I had to get up early today because I had a synchronous class with my Grade

                       9  students.  I  prepared  my  laptop  and  phone  and  checked  to  see  if  my  internet

                       connection  was  stable.  During  our  last  meeting,  I  informed  my  students  that  we


                       would have an activity today. I waited 5 minutes before the scheduled time for my

                       cooperating  teacher  to  send  me  the  Google  link.  Before  assigning  an  activity,  I

                       reviewed  direct  variation  with  my  Grade  9  students.  I  explain  the  directions  to  my

                       students on how to answer the activity. I noticed that they are doing their activities

                       silently, and there are times when I must remind them to open their cameras to see

                       them if they are doing the activity. They completed the activity in the allotted time and


                       submitted it to my cooperating teacher via private message.

                              After  lunch,  my  cooperating  teacher  sent  me  a  picture  of  my  students'

                       answers, instructing me to check it by editing the picture and using any color other

                       than red to check it. I checked my students' answers and wrote the correct answer if

                       their answers were incorrect, along with a motivational note for them, and submitted

                       it to my cooperating teacher. I am relieved to know that they understand what I have


                       discussed because mostly of my students received passing grades. I was relieved

                       and motivated to facilitate them.

                       Day 20: 29 October 2021

                              Today  is  Friday.  My  cooperating  teacher  has  no  assigned  task  for  me

                       because  she  does  not  have  a  math  lesson  schedule  every  Friday.  Since  I  do  not

                       have a task for my cooperating teacher, then I decided to check the responses of our


                       research  reliability  test.  I  re-distributed  the  Google  form  link  to  a  student.  I  am  so

                       disappointed  that  we  have  not  received  thirty  responses  yet.  It  is  hard  to  please

                       students to participate in our research study, they can easily ignore it because we

                       can only communicate with them online, and we cannot talk to them personally.

                               In  the  afternoon,  I  prepared  a  PowerPoint  presentation  for  my  Grade  9


                       students' inverse variation lesson. It takes me a long time to finish my PowerPoint

                       presentation  because  I  am  also  studying  and  researching  additional  information

                       about the lesson. It is my habit to watch video discussions on YouTube about the

                       topic to gain strategies for implementing the lesson in class. I prepared examples and

                       activities that are relevant to the learning objectives. As a teacher, it is important for

                       me  to  be  well-prepared  and  knowledgeable  about  the  subject  matter.  For  my

                       presentation,  I  used  a  simple  but  appealing  template  that  I  downloaded  from  the


                       internet. I used the appropriate fonts and font size to ensure that it was readable and

                       visible to my students before submitting it to my cooperating teacher for review.]]></page><page Index="437"><![CDATA[24


                       Day 21: 01 November 2021

                              It is a holiday today. I sent a message to my cooperating teacher, asking if

                       there was anything I could do for her. I told her that if she needed my assistance, she

                       should just let me know, and she told me to take this day off. I checked my email to


                       see  if  she  had already  sent the  picture of  the Grade 10  lesson, but  there  was  no

                       email  from  her.  So,  I  went  online  and  downloaded  the  learning  materials  for  the

                       second grade period from the DepEd. I studied the circle lesson and its subtopic. I

                       discovered  examples  and  activities  that  I  plan  to  use  when  creating  activities  and

                       quizzes. I discovered that the next topic for Grade 10 is all about chords, arcs, central


                       angles, and inscribed angles, and that this lesson includes circle theorems. I studied

                       theorems,  knowing  that  grade  10  students  were  more  likely  to  ask  questions  and

                       seek clarification on the lesson, so I should be prepared for this lesson.



                       Day 22: 02 November 2021

                              Tuesday is the day. Even though I do not have classes today, I got up early to

                       prepare  for  the  presentation  that  I  will  be  discussing  at  the  next  meeting.  After


                       receiving a picture of the lesson from my cooperating teacher, I created a PowerPoint

                       presentation  for  my  Grade  10  students  about  chords,  arcs,  central  angles,  and

                       inscribed angles. I will wait for her email before making a presentation because she

                       previously told me to use it as a reference. She reminds me that the examples and

                       activities  for  each  lesson must  come  from  the  school's  book, but  it  is  fine  if  I  use

                       examples from other sources. I did not make a lesson plan because she said I did

                       not need to; the important thing is to create a PowerPoint presentation for every class


                       discussion.  I  made  my  own  presentation  template  to  ensure  that  the  figures  and

                       content of my  lesson  fit on  every  slide.  I  spent  time  because  there  were  so many

                       figures and lines to insert into the slide. I used different fonts, as well as a single,

                       consistent animation, and printed out the figures as visual aids.]]></page><page Index="438"><![CDATA[25


                       Day 23: 03 November 2021

                              Today's  discussion  with  my  Grade  9  students  was  about  solving  word

                       problems  with  direct  variation.  I  am  so  proud  of  them;  they  listened  carefully  and

                       participated  every  time  I  asked  them  questions  about  the  topic,  and  after  the


                       discussion,  because  we  still  had  time,  I  gave  them  a  short  activity  to  see  if  they

                       learned anything. My cooperating teacher instructs them to send their work to her via

                       private message.

                              I taught a lesson about chords, arcs, central angles, and inscribed angles to

                       grade 10 students. It is all about proving theorems related in a circle, which is why

                       my students struggled to understand it; they kept asking how it happened, and I had


                       to explain it to them so they could understand how to prove theorems. I told them that

                       they  needed  to  pay  attention  to  the  figure  and  that  they  needed  to  know  how  to

                       identify the various parts of the circle. I also told them that to prove theorems, they

                       must carefully examine the figures and analyze what statements and reasons they

                       make  based  on  the  information  provided.  One  of  my  strategies  for  helping  them

                       understand and think critically on their own is allowing my students to share their own


                       statements and reasons. I gave them hints to help them analyze the next statements

                       and  reasons,  but  we  only  proved  two  theorems  that  day.  The  allotted  time  is

                       insufficient  to  discuss  all  the  theorems  because  they  found  it  difficult  to  prove

                       theorems, so I told them to study the next theorem that we will discuss at the next

                       meeting.

                              In the afternoon, I received the answer to my grade 9 students' activity from

                       my cooperating teacher, and I immediately checked it and sent it to her.  I am glad


                       that all my students received passing grades; this indicates that they understood our

                       discussion and that my teaching style was effective.]]></page><page Index="439"><![CDATA[26


                       Day 24: 04 November 2021

                              Today  is  Thursday,  and  I  discussed  inverse  variation  today  because  my

                       cooperating  teacher  previously  stated  that  she  will  allow  me  to  use  her  time  in

                       another subject for Grade 9 students if I need more time to discuss math lessons. My


                       students  were  consistent;  they  always  contributed  to  our  class  discussion.  They

                       shared their ideas and answered my questions about our topic very well. In this way,

                       I ensure that I call the names of all students for recitation to avoid bias and assess

                       their  learning  from  the  lesson.  What  an  engaging  class!  It  makes  me  happy  that

                       every  time  I  ask  my  students  a  question,  they  respond  correctly.  And  after  a

                       discussion, my cooperating teacher instructed me to create a quiz for Grade 9 and


                       Grade 10 students using a PowerPoint presentation. She told me that the quiz had to

                       have  fifteen  items.  I  made  a  list  of  everything  she  said  about  making  a  quiz  and

                       informed her that I would submit the presentation to check the given problems.



                       Day 25: 05 November 2021

                              Today is Friday, and I do not have any classes scheduled. This day I created


                       a PowerPoint presentation for the quiz for Grade 9 and 10 students. I used DepEd's

                       Grade 9 learning materials with my Grade 9 students. The quiz is all about direct and

                       inverse variation. For test one, my students will complete the given table; for test two,

                       they will find the constant and equation of variation from the given problem and graph

                       its representation; and for test three, students will solve the given problem using the

                       K-finding  method.  To  create  the  quiz  for  grade  10  students,  I  used  the  learning

                       materials for grade 10 copy from DepEd. The quiz divided into two parts: in Test 1,


                       students will use the given figure to identify and name the following terms related to

                       Circle  A,  while  in  Test  2,  they  will  prove  the  intersecting  chords  theorem  by

                       completing  the  given  table.  I  made  figures  of  circles,  inserted  lines,  and  shapes,

                       labeled them properly, and used the appropriate fonts and font size to make them

                       readable, and submitted them to my cooperating teacher.]]></page><page Index="440"><![CDATA[27


                       Day 26: 08 November 2021

                              It is Monday again. With my Grade 9 students, I taught them about solving

                       word problems involving inverse variation. Our class began with a prayer and then

                       moved on to the discussion. I realized that the time allotted for learning mathematics


                       in  an  online  class  was  insufficient  to  cover  the  entire  lesson,  which  is  why  my

                       cooperating teacher advised me to always go straight to the lesson, with no time for

                       extracurricular activities. I really impressed my students, especially Ate Ericka, Ate

                       Myraine, Ate Ashtrid, Ate Althea, and Kuya Ron, who I noticed are the top students in

                       my class. They always participate in our class discussions and receive the highest


                       scores  in  our  activities and  quizzes.  After our discussion,  I  assigned them  a  short

                       activity and asked them to submit it to my cooperating teacher.

                              I discussed the continuation of the lesson about proving theorems related to

                       circles with grade 10 students. I was relieved that all my students would understand

                       how to make statements from the figure and would be able to justify their statements.

                       I have noticed that my students, Kuya Joshua, Kuya Aron, and Kuya Nathaniel,  do

                       not  hesitate  to  ask  clarifying  questions.  All  my  students  took  part  in  our  class


                       discussion, which made me incredibly happy because every time I called their name,

                       they tried to respond and share their ideas. I admired their willingness to participate,

                       even  though  they  found  it  difficult  to  respond.  After  the  discussion,  I  assigned  an

                       activity related to proving theorems and instructed them to submit their answers to

                       my cooperating teacher.


                              In the afternoon, my cooperating teacher sent me a picture of the answer my

                       Grade 9 students gave in their recent activity. I checked it carefully, wrote the correct

                       answer if they got the wrong answer, and submitted it to my cooperating teacher for

                       recording the score. I am so happy that mostly of my students got the passing score;

                       it means that they really understood our discussion.]]></page><page Index="441"><![CDATA[28


                       Day 27: 09 November 2021

                              Today is Tuesday. I woke up early and ate my breakfast immediately, even

                       though I did not have synchronous classes today. I checked my Gmail account to see

                       if  there  was  a  message  from  my  cooperating  teacher.  I  used  this  day  to  create  a


                       PowerPoint presentation for the lesson about joint variation because my cooperating

                       teacher sent me a copy of the lesson for Grade 9 in my Gmail. While creating it, I

                       also watched a YouTube video about joint variation, which helped me understand the

                       lesson as well as how to execute it properly. For my presentation, I used a simple but

                       appealing template with one animation on each slide. I used appropriate fonts and


                       font  sizes  to  make  it  readable.  I  downloaded  images  to  represent  the  lesson's

                       examples. I spent a long time finishing my PowerPoint presentation for joint variation

                       because I was also studying the lesson. I always include the learning objectives of

                       the lesson in my presentation to inform my students what they will be able to do after

                       the discussions.

                              As a teacher, it is essential to have proficiency in the content so that when my

                       students ask questions, I can properly answer them. I was slightly sad that I could not


                       conduct activities related to the lesson due to the limited time. That is why to pique

                       their interest, I need to sound energetic while discussing and keep them interactive

                       the  whole  time. I  submitted the copied PowerPoint  presentation  to my  cooperating

                       teacher for checking.]]></page><page Index="442"><![CDATA[29


                       Day 28: 10 November 2021

                              Today is Wednesday. I woke up early and prepared my devices that I would

                       use  for  my  synchronous  class.  I  always  make  sure  that  I  am  ready  ten  minutes

                       before the exact time of discussion. When my cooperating teacher sent me a link for


                       Google Meet, I joined immediately and was ready for the class discussion.

                              My Grade 9 students and I discussed the joint variation. This time, I asked

                       other  students  to  answer  my  questions  about  our  topic,  especially  those  I  did  not

                       know yet, because I wanted to know their weaknesses and strengths so that I could

                       assess them based on their abilities. I noticed Kuya Paolo, a student with a special


                       condition; his strength was in solving multiplication problems, so for him to participate

                       in our class discussion, I always called him to ask the question that I knew he would

                       be able to answer. After the discussion, I assigned an activity to assess their learning

                       from our discussion and instructed them to submit their answers to my cooperating

                       teacher.

                              With Grade 10 students, we continue our discussion about proving theorems.

                       We spend a time in proving theorems, which is understandable because theorems


                       are difficult to prove, but the important thing is that they can understand and prove

                       theorems on their own. They were always curious and eager to learn more about our

                       subject. They express their curiosity, which always surprises me, and I am glad that I

                       was able to answer their questions.]]></page><page Index="443"><![CDATA[30


                       Day 29: 11 November 2021

                              This was the day my cooperating teacher instructed me to prepare a long test

                       for grades 9 and 10 and submit it for checking on Monday. She informed me that the

                       long test schedule was approaching and that each test paper would consist of thirty


                       multiple-choice questions. In the morning, I created a long test for Grade 9 and 10

                       students,  using  a  PowerPoint  presentation  and  DepEd  learning  materials

                       downloaded from the internet. The long test contains thirty multiple-choice items: in

                       grade 9, it is all about variation, while in grade 10, it is all about circles and proving

                       theorems.


                              In the afternoon,  I  created a PowerPoint  presentation  for  Grade 9  students

                       about  combined  variation.  I  used  a  simple  template  that  was  appropriate  for  my

                       lesson. I made it readable and visible by using the appropriate fonts and font size. To

                       make  my  students  appreciate  the  lesson,  I  used  images  to  represent  various

                       problems. I submitted the documents to my cooperating teacher as her copy.



                       Day 30: 12 November 2021


                              Today  is  Friday.  Since  I  do  not  have  synchronous  classes  every  Friday,  I

                       decided to create a PowerPoint presentation about tangents and secants of the circle

                       for  Grade  10  students  that  we  will  discuss  at  our  next  meeting.  I  spent  time  in

                       creating the presentation because there are figures that I needed to create. I studied

                       the lesson and searched for videos of people discussing it on YouTube. Because it


                       was  all  about  proving  theorems  again,  I  needed  to  master  the  lesson.  I  was

                       disappointed  with  the  book  because  I  discovered  errors  in  it,  and  I  realized  that  I

                       needed to be more careful and knowledgeable about the subject to avoid confusion,

                       especially since my students are inquisitive. I am proud of myself because I was able

                       to identify if there was an error in the book, which means that I already know the topic

                       and  believe  I  will  be  able  to  deliver  it  to  my  students  properly  and  answer  their

                       inquiries.]]></page><page Index="444"><![CDATA[31


                       Day 31: 15 November 2021

                              What a hectic day! We begin the day with a prayer in the morning. Kuya Ron,

                       my Grade 9 student, really impressed me when he shared his wonderful prayer in

                       class.  I  discussed  the  combined  variation  with  students  in  Grade  9.  They  learned


                       faster  than  I  expected  because  the  combined  variation  is  a  combination  of  all  the

                       variations  we  have  already  discussed.  My  entire  class  took  part  in  our  class

                       discussion. I am extremely happy that they are eager to learn and are engaged in the

                       lesson.  After  the  discussion,  I  assigned  an  activity  to  assess  their  learning  and

                       instructed  them  to  submit  their  answers  to  my  cooperating  teacher.  While  in  my


                       grade  10  students,  I  gave  them  a  quiz  and  instructed  them  to  submit  it  to  my

                       cooperating teacher after they answered it. I explained how to answer their quiz and

                       gave  them  enough  time  to  complete  each  portion.  They  responded  to  their  quiz

                       silently and we ended our class exactly at the allotted time.

                               In  the  afternoon,  I  created  the  PowerPoint  presentation  of  Quiz  #  2  for

                       Grade 9 students. The quiz divided into three parts, each of which focuses on joint

                       and combined variation. For test one, students must complete the given table, while


                       for test two, they must solve a problem involving joint variation, and for test  three,

                       they must solve a problem involving combined variation. I made sure that it has a

                       clear  direction  for  them  to  understand  what  they  will  do  to  answer  the  quiz.  After

                       creating  a  PowerPoint  presentation  for  the  quiz,  I  submitted  it  to  my  cooperating

                       teacher for checking.]]></page><page Index="445"><![CDATA[32


                       Day 32: 16 November 2021

                              Today  is  Tuesday.  I  woke  up  early  and,  since  I  do  not  have  synchronous

                       classes  today,  I  decided  to  check  the  work  of  my  students  in  both  levels  that  I

                       managed.


                              I started with the work of my grade 9 students. I am happy that my students

                       received passing grades; this indicates that they understood our class discussion. I

                       appreciated  Kuya  Paolo's  effort;  despite  being  a  special  student,  he  was eager  to

                       participate in the activity. I have noticed that my students mistakenly copy the given

                       problems  in  my  presentation,  which  is  why  they  got  the  wrong  answer,  but  the


                       important  thing  is  that  they  already  know  the  process  on  how  to  solve  the  same

                       problems.

                              Then, I checked my grade 10 students' answers to their recent quiz. Few of

                       my students still did not know how to identify and name the parts of a circle in the

                       figure,  but  I  was  surprised  that  mostly  of  my  students  got  the  perfect  score  when

                       proving  theorems.  Now  I  realize  that  I  must  do  something  in  areas  where  my

                       students failed to answer correctly.


                              I made sure that I put the correct answer in every wrong answer that they got

                       for them to know why they got it wrong, but even though they got the wrong answer, I

                       still gave them a point for the effort. In this way, they will always feel motivated and

                       participate in our class activities. I want them to feel that it is okay to make mistakes if

                       we do our best and are always willing to learn. Then, after checking the work of all


                       my students, I sent it to my cooperating teacher for her to record the outputs of the

                       students.]]></page><page Index="446"><![CDATA[33


                       Day 33: 17 November 2021

                              Today,  I  woke  up  early  and  prepared  my  devices  that  I  would  use  in  our

                       synchronous class. As usual, I waited for the Google Meet link from my cooperating

                       teacher  to  join  the  class.  I  am  still  wondering  why my cooperating teacher  did not


                       allow me to create the link since I was the one who was going to facilitate the class,

                       but I still respect her decision. I am here to follow what my cooperating teacher wants

                       and needs.

                              I  discussed  joint  and  combined  variations  with  Grade  9  students  as  we

                       prepared for the quiz. After our discussion, I gave them a 15-item quiz; this is their


                       second quiz for the second grade period. The quiz divided into three sections, and I

                       explained the direction of each section to ensure that they understood how to answer

                       the quiz. I noticed that they were taking the quiz silently. I reminded my students to

                       open  their  cameras  while taking  the  quiz to  demonstrate  that they are  taking  it  on

                       their own, because I noticed my students closing their cameras when the quiz began.

                       I instruct them to submit their work to my cooperating teacher if they have already

                       completed it.


                              With Grade 10 students, I discussed the continuation of the previous lesson

                       on proving theorems related to tangents and secants of the circle. I have noticed that

                       they already know how to construct their own statements and arguments to prove the

                       given theorem. They show their interest in our lesson, as they always do in my class,

                       which makes me happy because we always have an active interaction.]]></page><page Index="447"><![CDATA[34


                       Day 34: 18 November 2021

                              It is Thursday today. My cooperating teacher sent me an email with the Grade

                       9  lesson,  but I  am surprised that  it  is  not  related  to  the mathematics  subject.  The

                       lesson  is  about  common  communicable diseases,  and  it  is meant for my  Grade  9


                       students'  MAPEH  class.  I  was  surprised at  first,  but as  a future  teacher,  I  had no

                       choice  but  to  do  it.  Because  I  needed  to  teach  this  lesson  by  tomorrow,  I  quickly

                       created a PowerPoint presentation for it. To learn more about the lesson, I searched

                       for and watched videos about it. It is important that I have a broad understanding of

                       the  subject  so  that  I  can  provide  more  information  to  my  students.  I  searched  for


                       those unfamiliar words to fully comprehend it. To make my presentation readable and

                       visible to my students, I used a simple template, appropriate fonts, and font size, and

                       the lesson content was readable on each slide.

                              The lesson was truly relevant and timely because of Covid- 19 virus that we

                       faced today, and I believe that my we will have an interactive class discussion since

                       everyone  can  be  able  to  relate  it.  I  was  thinking  that  my  cooperating  teacher

                       challenge my flexibility as a student-teacher that is why she gave this MAPEH lesson


                       and I willingly accept her challenge, I will do my best to discuss it to my students.]]></page><page Index="448"><![CDATA[35


                       Day 35: 19 November 2021

                              On this day, I discussed with Grade 9 students about common communicable

                       diseases. My cooperating teacher reminds me that I need to finish the lesson today

                       because they have topics to discuss. I was confused as to how I was going to wrap


                       up the entire topic, knowing that there was so much to cover. Unfortunately, we did

                       not finish discussing the lesson because time was insufficient for the subject. After a

                       discussion, my cooperating teacher provided me advice. She told me that in MAPEH,

                       I should always allow my students to share their ideas and experiences by asking

                       them  because  most  students  can  relate  to  and  appreciate  the  lesson,  unlike  in


                       mathematics, where most ideas and information come from the teacher. I admit that I

                       forgot to ask my students to share their thoughts and experiences about the lesson; I

                       focused on finishing the lesson in the allotted time, which was incorrect. To have an

                       interactive class, I realized that it was more important to have interaction between me

                       and  my  students  in every discussion than  to  finish  the  lesson  immediately.  In  this

                       way, I can assess my students' learning from the lesson. She also informed me that I

                       would need to review both my grade 9 and grade 10 students on Monday to prepare


                       them for their upcoming long test. She told me that I had to use the content from the

                       long test that I had prepared, but that I had to revise the given problem. She asked

                       how I would evaluate my students. I told her that I would evaluate them using Quiz

                       Bee, and she agreed, saying it was a great idea.]]></page><page Index="449"><![CDATA[36


                       Day 36: 22 November 2021

                              What an engaging day! As a review, I prepared a presentation with multiple-

                       choice questions about variation for grade 9 students and circle questions for grade

                       10 students. The quiz bee's title is Who Wants to Earn Points, and the theme is like


                       Who  Wants  to  Be  a  Billionaire,  a  TV  5  game  show  hosted  by  Vic  Sotto.  The

                       questions are all like what I prepared for their long test to familiarize them with how to

                       answer the given problem. Students received bonus points for each correct answer.

                       My students from both levels were delighted because they had enjoyed our review

                       for their long test. I am incredibly happy that they understand our lessons and can


                       answer all the questions that I have asked. It means that my teaching method was

                       effective, and it indicates that my students will receive a passing grade on their long

                       test.



                       Day 37: 23 November 2021

                              Today,  my  cooperating  teacher  sent  me  a  copy  of  the  lesson  for  Grade  9

                       students in my Gmail account. I immediately created a PowerPoint presentation for


                       the  new  lesson  about  Zero  and  Negative  Integral  Exponents.  I  searched  for  and

                       watched videos to learn more about the lesson and get ideas on how to implement it.

                       I felt relieved that this lesson was familiar to me because I already knew it from the

                       discussion  with  my  previous  instructor,  and  I  am  confident  that  I  will  be  able  to

                       discuss  it  perfectly  with  my  students.  For  my  presentation,  I  used  a  simple  but


                       captivating template that I downloaded from the internet. I used appropriate fonts and

                       font  sizes to  make my  presentation  readable and  visible.  I used  one  animation  on

                       each slide because too much animation causes my presentation to stop. I double-

                       checked the content of my slide to ensure that the lesson objective was present and

                       that  there  were  no  errors.  In  the  evening,  I  sent  a  copy  of  my  PowerPoint

                       presentation to my cooperating teacher via private message.]]></page><page Index="450"><![CDATA[37


                       Day 38: 24 November 2021

                              Today, I reviewed with the Grade 10 students how to prove theorems in Circle

                       to prepare them for the upcoming long test. We discussed how to prove an inscribed

                       angle  theorem.  I  gave  them  a  given  figure  and  asked  them  to  prove  it.  I  let  my


                       students make their own statements and reasons, and sometimes I gave them a hint

                       to make them think about what the next statement and reason would be based on the

                       figure.  I  observed  that  my  students  will  find  it  difficult,  but  others  will  succeed.  I

                       always remind them that to get the next statement, they must rely on the previous

                       one  because  all  the  statements  they  are  about  to  make  must  be  related  to  the


                       previous one. After the review, my cooperating teacher instructed me to re-edit my

                       prepared  long  test,  and  she  also  instructed  me  to  change  the  given  problem  in

                       proving the theorem because it was like what I reviewed with my students. I re-edited

                       the long test and sent it to her immediately.



                       Day 39: 25 November 2021

                              Today, I woke up early and created a PowerPoint presentation for my grade 9


                       students' lesson on Rational Exponents. I used a simple template with a numerical

                       design  that  I  found  on  the  internet.  To  make  my  presentation  readable,  I  used

                       appropriate fonts and font sizes, and the lesson content was readable into each slide.

                       I researched and watched videos on the topic to gain more information and ideas on

                       how to execute the lesson. It takes time to create my presentation since it is my habit


                       to study the topic while doing it. To avoid mistakes during the discussion, I double-

                       checked  all  the  examples  and  their  solutions  and  submitted  the  copy  of  the

                       PowerPoint presentation to my cooperating teacher for checking.]]></page><page Index="451"><![CDATA[38


                       Day 40: 26 November 2021

                              This was the day when I created the PowerPoint presentation for the Grade 9

                       lesson  on  the  laws  of  radicals.  I  used  a  template  with  a  numerical  design  and

                       appropriate fonts and font size. Because there are no examples in the book, I used


                       from the Grade 9 learning materials, a copy from the DepEd downloaded from the

                       internet. I researched and watched videos on the subject because it is important for

                       me as a teacher to understand the subject, especially as it contains different laws for

                       radicals. Every law contains an example to help distinguish the differences between

                       the  laws.  To  familiarize  them  with  the  various  laws,  I  include  explanation  in  each


                       solution as to what type of law used to arrive at the definitive answer. I am hoping

                       that I will be able to execute it correctly based on what I have learned from the book

                       and videos.



                       Day 41: 29 November 2021

                              Today is Monday. Monday has arrived. I woke up and prepared my teaching

                       aids  for  the  day,  only  to  discover  that  there  would  be  no  classes  until  tomorrow


                       because it was a holiday. My cooperating teacher did not notify me that there would

                       be no class today. She just told me there was no class when I asked where the link

                       for the class discussion was, and then she apologized for not informing me about the

                       memo,  saying  she  forgot  because  she  had  paperwork,  and  I  said  it  is  okay,  I

                       understand.  What  am  I  going  to  do?  I  silently  chuckle  at  what  happened  to  me.  I


                       would not have gotten up so early if I had known there would be no class today. The

                       weather is cold, and it is nice to sleep. To make my day more productive, I double-

                       checked my presentation and studied the lesson I will be discussing on Wednesday. I

                       watched  YouTube  videos and  looked up  other  references on  the topic, particularly

                       the laws of exponents; it is crucial that I be able to introduce it before discussing the

                       new lesson.]]></page><page Index="452"><![CDATA[39


                       Day 42: 30 November 2021

                              It is Bonifacio Day. There will be no synchronous classes today because it is

                       a regular holiday. My cooperating teacher advised me to use this day as my rest day.

                       I  do  not  have  anything  to  do  because  I  have  already  created  and  prepared  my


                       presentation for both grade levels. I checked my Gmail account to see if there was a

                       new  message  from  my  cooperating  teacher,  but  there  was  none,  so  I  could  not

                       create a new PowerPoint presentation. I decided to do something for our research

                       study,  so  I  checked  to  see  if  there  was  a  new  response  from  our  research

                       questionnaire,  but  there  was  none,  which  means  they  ignored  our  request.  It  is


                       difficult to find someone who is willing to help us.

                              In  the  afternoon,  I  decided  to  read  and  study  the  lessons  that  I  will  be

                       discussing by tomorrow. I want everything to be perfect. I do not want to disappoint

                       my cooperating teacher, which is why I always do my best. I want her to be proud of

                       me as her student-teacher. And I do not want my students to dislike me because I do

                       not know how to teach them properly. That is why I will make sure that I always have

                       a proficiency in the lesson.]]></page><page Index="453"><![CDATA[40


                       Day 43: 01 December 2021

                              Today is Wednesday. I woke up early to prepare my devices and make sure

                       they  had  an  internet  connection  for  class  discussion.  Before  we  begin,  my

                       cooperating teacher instructs me to go over lessons 2.1 and 2.2, which are all about


                       Zero and Negative Integral Exponents and Rational Exponents. Since the zero and

                       negative  integral  exponents  are  subject  to  the  law  of  exponents,  which  they  have

                       already discussed, I will briefly review it. I began by recalling the laws of exponents

                       and then discussed the two topics within the time allotted. Fortunately, my students

                       were adaptive learners, and even when I spoke quickly, they understood what I was


                       saying. They participated in our class discussion and demonstrated an interest in the

                       lesson, but I noticed that mostly of my students found it difficult to deal with rational

                       exponents.  That  is  why,  since  we  are  talking  about  rational,  I  discussed  fractions.

                       After  recalling fractions,  they  are  glad  to  remember  them  and  can  simplify  rational

                       expressions  on  their  own.  With  Grade  10  students,  I  discussed  proving  theorems

                       related  to  tangents  and  secants  of  a  circle.  My  students  easily  proved  the  given

                       theorem because they were already familiar with those figures and theorems. I am


                       immensely proud of them and happy that they listened to what I have been teaching

                       them and giving them advice on how to prove various theorems. Now I see that they

                       learned from it.]]></page><page Index="454"><![CDATA[41


                       Day 44: 02 December 2021

                              Today  is  Thursday.  My  cooperating  teacher  did  not  provide  me  with  a

                       schedule for Grade 9 students. As a result, I created a PowerPoint presentation for a

                       new  lesson  about  sectors  and  segments  of  a  circle  for  Grade  10  students.  While


                       creating the presentation, I searched for and watched videos on the topic, which was

                       useful  because  I  discovered  that  the  content  from  the  book  was  incomplete.  I

                       designed  my  own  template  and  used  appropriate  fonts  and  font  size  to  make  my

                       presentation  readable.  I  organized  all  the  content  in  my  slide  and  highlighted  the

                       different formulas. I used pictures from the internet and created figures to finish the


                       presentation quickly and submit it to my cooperating teacher.



                       Day 45: 03 December 2021

                              Today is the day that I created a PowerPoint presentation for my Grade 10

                       students  about  problem  solving  in  a  circle.  Dealing  with  problems  is  one  of  my

                       weaknesses, so I studied the lesson thoroughly and watched various videos on the

                       topic. I must face it because I am a teacher. Even though it is difficult, I must do my


                       best to understand the lesson so that I can properly teach it. I know that my Grade 10

                       students are constantly looking for answers and clarification, especially if they do not

                       understand the lesson, so I need to be ready for them. To make it readable, I used a

                       simple template downloaded from the internet, as well as appropriate fonts and font

                       size.  To  make  the  given  problem  more  understandable  for  the  students,  I  used


                       images from the internet and created figures.]]></page><page Index="455"><![CDATA[42


                       Day 46: 06 December 2021

                              Today  is  Monday.  I  taught  a  lesson  on  the  laws  of  radicals  to  grade  9

                       students. We begin our discussion with Ate Erica's prayer. I noticed that my students

                       had more difficulty dealing with radicals than variations, so I had to explain the lesson


                       slowly and clearly. In each law of radicals, I provided more examples to help them

                       understand  and  distinguish  the  differences.  I  demonstrated  how  to  use  the  law  of

                       radicals  to  simplify  radical  expressions  step  by  step.  I  gave  them  the  right  to

                       determine the next step and the law of radicals that would apply. I noticed that mostly

                       of my students did not want to respond when I called their name, so I told them to try


                       to respond and not be afraid to make mistakes. I encourage them to participate in our

                       class discussion and ask if they need anything clarified.

                              While  in  Grade  10,  students,  we  continued  to  talk  about  how  to  prove

                       theorems. We spent time in proving theorems because there are so many under the

                       tangents and secants of the circle. We only discussed two theorems in each meeting,

                       so we discussed the lesson quickly this time, and because they were already familiar

                       with  theorems,  it  was  easy  for  them  to  prove  the  given  problem.  They  actively


                       participated in our class discussion, which was exactly what I expected from them. I

                       noticed that mostly of my students were showing an interest in the lesson this time.

                       Mostly of them raised their hands to share their ideas, so I called those students who

                       did  not  want  to  answer  before,  and  they  are  now  fully  engaged  in  our  class

                       discussion. I am incredibly pleased with these students; there is never a dull moment


                       with  them;  they  are  the  type  of  students  who  are  full  of  energy  and  have

                       demonstrated a strong interest in the lesson.]]></page><page Index="456"><![CDATA[43


                       Day 47: 07 December 2021

                              Today is Tuesday. For Grade 9 students, I created a PowerPoint presentation

                       on simplifying radical expressions. I used a simple template with a numerical design

                       that I found on the internet. To make it readable, I used appropriate fonts and font


                       sizes,  ensuring  that  the  content  of  the  lesson  fit  into  each  slide.  I  also  double-

                       checked the solutions to ensure there were no mistakes or confusion about the topic.

                       I  searched for  and  watched  YouTube  videos  on  the  topic  to gain more  knowledge

                       and ideas on how to  conduct this lesson. Since I observed that my students were

                       having difficulty simplifying radical expressions, I considered strategies that will make

                       it  easier  for  them.  I  included  activities  in  my  presentation  based  on  the  various


                       expressions from the learning materials that I downloaded previously. I want them to

                       answer  it  on  their  own  to  gauge  their  understanding  of  the  topic.  My  cooperating

                       teacher  received  a  copy  of  my  PowerPoint  presentation  before  I  discussed  the

                       lesson.



                       Day 48: 08 December 2021


                              Today,  I  taught  my  Grade  9  students  about  the  law  of  radicals.  My

                       cooperating teacher informed me last night that I needed to review the law of radicals

                       with my students and give them a quiz on it. To summarize, I instruct my students to

                       simplify the given radical expression and identify which law of radicals they will use to

                       master  the  topic.  I  called  each  of  my  students  individually  to  assess  their  own

                       learning, especially those who were having difficulty dealing with radical expressions.

                       I'm  glad  I  saw  an  improvement  in  those  students  who  previously  refused  to


                       participate. They were no longer afraid to speak up in front of the class. We talked

                       about the segments and sectors of a circle with my Grade 10 students. I'm surprised

                       that we only discussed the sector area of the circle; I thought we'd be able to finish

                       the  lesson  today,  but  we  won't  be  able  to  because  my  students  have  a  lot  of

                       questions and clarifications that I need to answer and explain patiently.]]></page><page Index="457"><![CDATA[44


                       Day 49: 09 December 2021

                              It  is  the  second  day  of  my  vaccination.  I  informed  my  cooperating  teacher

                       yesterday  that  I  was  unable  to  teach  today  since  it  was  my  second  dose  of  my

                       vaccine. I arrived early at the venue to join the crowds in line and went home after


                       vaccination.

                               In the afternoon after making sure that I am okay after vaccinated, I created

                       PowerPoint  presentation  for  the  quiz  #  3  of  grade  9  students,  which  is  all  about

                       radicals.  I  copied  the  given  expressions  from  the  Grade  9  learning  materials  I

                       downloaded from the internet. The quiz divided into three parts, each with five items.

                       For the first test, students will simplify the given expressions and write their answers


                       with  positive  exponents,  while  for  the  second  test,  they  will  simplify  rational

                       expressions and write their answers with positive exponents, and for the third test,

                       they will convert each expression that contains rational exponents into radical form

                       and  vice  versa.  I  used  an  uncomplicated  design  for  my  presentation  and  used

                       appropriate fonts and font size to make it readable. I used numbering for the given

                       expressions  to  determine  what  number  it  was,  and  I  submitted  the  PowerPoint


                       presentation to my cooperating teacher after finishing it for her to check.]]></page><page Index="458"><![CDATA[45


                       Day 50: 10 December 2021

                              Today  is  Friday.  I  woke  up  early  and  checked  my  Gmail  if  there  are  new

                       emails for me, and I found out that my cooperating teacher sent me a message last

                       night, instructing me to create the second periodic test for both grade levels that I


                       oversaw.  She  informed  me  that  the  test  would  consist  of  fifty  multiple-choice

                       questions. She emailed me a copy of the unit test from the book and instructed me to

                       use it to create the test.

                              So today I created the periodic test for Grade 9 students in Microsoft Word. I

                       divided their long test into two parts: the first part had twenty items all about variation,


                       and the second part had twenty-five items all about radicals. Students will also solve

                       the  given  word  problems  involving  variation  in  the  second  part.  For  Grade  10

                       students, I also divided the exam into two sections. The first section consisted of forty

                       multiple-choice  questions  about  circles,  and  the  second  section  consisted  of  ten

                       items in which students completed the table to prove the given theorem by selecting

                       their answer from the box. I double-checked the test before submitting a soft copy to

                       my cooperating teacher for checking.]]></page><page Index="459"><![CDATA[46


                       Day 51: 13 December 2021

                              Today  I  discussed  the  lesson  about  simplifying  radical  expressions  with

                       Grade 9 students. We started with a prayer by Ate Myraine. It is another lesson on

                       simplifying  radical  expressions  using  different  methods.  Simplify  the  radical


                       expressions  by  extracting  the  roots,  reduction  of  the  index,  rationalization  of  the

                       denominator,  and  binomial  denominator.  Since  we  already  discussed  the  laws  for

                       exponents and  radicals, they found  it  easy  to  simplify.  They  easily understood  our

                       lesson.  Every  time  I  called  their  name,  they  eagerly  shared  their  thoughts  and

                       responses to the question I had posed. They showed their confidence in sharing their


                       ideas in the class, whereas before, mostly of them felt shy about answering. During

                       the discussion, I teach them the incorrect way to simplify the radical expression by

                       rationalizing the binomial denominator. I thought that it needed to get the conjugate

                       of the binomial denominator to rationalize. That is why there was something wrong

                       with  our  discussion  since  the  solution  to  example  number  one  did  not  get  the

                       conjugate  but  simplified  by  the  usual  method  of  rationalization.  To  cover  up  my

                       mistake, I explained to them that if both terms of a binomial are in the radicand, we


                       must simplify by our usual method of rationalization, but if each term is in the radical,

                       then  we  must  get  the  conjugate  of  the  denominator.  It  is  good  that  I  was  able  to

                       explain and clarify the mistake that I made.

                              With  Grade  10  students,  we  discussed  segments  and  sectors  of  a  circle.

                       Since last time we only discussed the sector area of a circle, this day we continued to


                       discuss  the  sector  arc  length,  segment  chord  length, and  segment  area.  I told my

                       students to listen carefully before asking questions, because we have a limited time,

                       and it is important that we finish the topic before the examination. They found it easy

                       because they used the formula to substitute the given to find the sector area, sector

                       arc  length,  segment  chord  length,  and  segment  area.  After  discussion,  my

                       cooperating teacher told me that I had to review my students before taking their test.]]></page><page Index="460"><![CDATA[47


                       Day 52: 14 December 2021

                              Today  is  Tuesday.  I  do  not  have  any  schedule  for  teaching.  That  is  why  I

                       used this day to create a PowerPoint presentation (Q & A Portion) to review Grade 9

                       and 10 students for their second periodical test. In Grade 9 students, I called it "Mr. &


                       Ms.  Mathinik  2021,"  while  "Mr.  &  Ms.  Mathanong  2021"  in  Grade  10  students,

                       students  will  act  as  candidates  in  a  pageant.  The  prestige  beauty  pageant  Ms.

                       Universe  2021  inspired  the  theme.  I  put  the  title  in  my  first  slide  and  used  an

                       attractive design to make the pageant real, and I used a simple template in the slide

                       for  the  questionnaire  to make  it  readable.  The  presentations  contain  forty  items  of


                       questions that relate to all the lessons that we have discussed for their second grade

                       period. The items were  like what I prepared for their  second periodical test. In this

                       way, they could have an idea of how to answer their test.



                       Day 53: 15 December 2021

                              Today, I gave my Grade 9 students an activity and exercises on simplifying

                       radical expressions because I noticed that mostly of them still did not know how to


                       simplify. I called their names and asked them to try to answer the questions on the

                       board; if they got the wrong answer, I explained the correct one slowly so they could

                       understand. As a teacher, I always praised their efforts to learn, and I have noticed

                       that  even  if  dealing  with  radicals  was  difficult  for  them,  they  still  wanted  to  try,

                       especially if someone encouraged and praised their work. It was a day that Grade 10


                       students will never forget because they had an enjoyable time reviewing the lesson

                       for their second periodic test. When I called their name, they chose which number

                       they would answer, and if they got the correct answer within one minute, they would

                       receive  ten pesos  in  Gcash  as  a  reward.  I am  immensely proud  of  them because

                       mostly of them got the correct answer, and even if they got the wrong answer, they

                       still tried to answer the question. We finished the review, and everyone was pleased

                       and grateful for the knowledge and reward they received from me.]]></page><page Index="461"><![CDATA[48


                       Day 54: 16 December 2021

                              This  was  the  last  day  that  I  managed  my  Grade  9  students  in  the

                       mathematics subject, so I made this day unforgettable for them. We start the day with

                       a prayer by Ate Althea. They were surprised when I presented my presentation and


                       read the title that we would have a pageant as their review for their second periodical

                       test. They were all excited, especially when they heard about the reward, a 10-peso

                       Gcash/load per question. They listened carefully when I discussed the mechanics of

                       the review. At first, I was really surprised that they were able to answer my question

                       quickly, but when it comes to solving it, they pass the question to another classmate


                       who can help them. I gave them enough time to solve the given problem to get the

                       correct answer, and when there was a time that they explained their answer, I gave

                       them an additional reward. Everybody was happy with the learning and rewards that

                       they got from me. I felt touched when they say thank you and that they will miss me.

                       We finished our review with a sad feeling deep inside my heart because, even in  a

                       brief period, I already loved them as my students.




                       Day 55: 17 December 2021

                              Today is Friday. Since my cooperating teacher sent me a message last night,

                       allowing me to discuss the remaining topic about common communicable diseases in

                       Grade  9  students,  When  I  entered  our  Google  classroom,  all  my  students  were

                       surprised when they saw me. Before the discussion, my cooperating teacher told me


                       that  she  would give me  30 minutes  to  discuss  the entire  topic  under  the  common

                       communicable  diseases.  Since  it  is  all  about  diseases  and  to  have  an  interactive

                       class  discussion,  I  asked  my  students  if  they  had  already  experienced  those

                       diseases that we have been discussing and, if so, what they did to cure the disease.

                       Students  share  their  experiences  with  that  disease  in  class.  I  am  happy  that  they

                       participated  in  our  brief  discussion.  I  ended  the  discussion  by  saying  how  I  am

                       thankful for their love for me as their teacher in such a brief time.]]></page><page Index="462"><![CDATA[49


                       Day 56: 20 December 2021

                              Today is the second periodical test for my grade 9 students. My cooperating

                       teacher told me to use this day to create my lesson plan for my final demo, but how

                       can I make my lesson plan? As of now, I do not have a copy of the lesson about the


                       distance formula. She still  did not send me the picture from the book that  she has

                       been using. She told me that she was going to send it to my Gmail account, but until

                       now there has been no message at all. I  must wait before making my lesson plan

                       because she wants me to use the content and activities from the book to discuss the

                       distance formula with my Grade 10 students. Since I already knew what my topic for


                       my  final  demo  was,  I  searched  and  watched  YouTube  videos  for  additional

                       information to gain  ideas for  what activities  I  should use  to  align  with  the  learning

                       objectives of the lesson.



                       Day 57: 21 December 2021

                              It was the day that my Grade 10 students were to take their second periodical

                       test, and my cooperating teacher was the one who facilitated the test. I checked my


                       Gmail  account  to  see  if  there  was  a  message  from  her,  but  still  there  was  no

                       message at all. Aside from her, I was able to obtain a copy of the distance formula

                       lesson from my Grade 10 students, so I sent a message to Kuya Nathaniel asking

                       him a favor to take a picture of the distance formula in their book and he promised to

                       send it to me after they took their exam.so thankful when Kuya Nathaniel sent me a


                       message  containing the picture of the topic, and  now  I'm  able  to make my  lesson

                       plan and submit it to my cooperating teacher afterward.]]></page><page Index="463"><![CDATA[50


                       Day 58: 10 January 2022

                              Today is Monday. The vacation is over.  It is our first day of classes after a

                       long  vacation.  It  is  time  to  face  the  reality  that  I  am  going  to  perform  my  final

                       demonstration  on  Wednesday.  Yesterday,  my  cooperating  teacher  called  me  on


                       Facebook Messenger to give feedback on my lesson plan that I submitted last day.

                       She  first  tackled  my  learning  objectives.  She  told  me  that  I  do  not  yet  have  an

                       affective  domain.  She  suggested  using  the  key  word  "appreciate"  for  my  affective

                       domain. When it comes to my activities, she suggests that I use familiar places to

                       adapt to the localization and it is also important that I conduct a group activity even if


                       we are in an online setting. She also told me to make my lesson plan in detail instead

                       of  a  semi-detailed  lesson  plan  to  make  her  know  the  detailed  flow  of  my  final

                       demonstration,  and  she  instructed  me  to  perform  a  try  out  for  my  final  demo  for

                       Grade 9 students to see how I execute my lesson plan. I just listened and noted all

                       her suggestions and recommendations for my final demo at that time and revised my

                       lesson plan immediately.

                              Today, I am so hopeless after the trial of my final demonstration with Grade 9


                       students; we were not able to discuss all the content of my lesson plan in one hour.

                       We were not able to do the activities for application and evaluation, and it is not good

                       for me because in a real-life final demonstration I must discuss all the content of my

                       lesson plan. I am worried about the allocated time that I must consume for my final

                       demo, so I told my cooperating teacher all my worries. She told me to remove given


                       problems in my activities and always check the time and manage it properly while

                       discussing. I must call the name of my students quickly, and if I call the student who

                       does not want to answer, I must just count 5 seconds to call the other students to

                       limit  the  time  on  calling  the  students  who  will  participate  in  class discussion.  After

                       hearing  her  suggestions,  I  felt  relieved  and  hoped  for  a  successful  final

                       demonstration.]]></page><page Index="464"><![CDATA[51


                       Day 59: 11 January 2022

                              What a busy day! This morning I sent a message to my cooperating teacher

                       informing her that I had changed my learning objectives in the affective domain. I told

                       her that the keyword "appreciate" is not measurable and I must avoid using it, so I


                       used  the  keyword  "solve"  since  from  what  I have  searched,  this  keyword  is  in  the

                       affective domain. I also informed her that I decided to remove the activity that I made

                       for motivation, instead I will review the students' past lessons as my motivation, but I

                       will  still  use  the  concept for  the  activity  in the  application  since  she  really  liked  its

                       concept. And for her final suggestion, she advised me to use animation and moving


                       objects and figures to illustrate the given problems in my PowerPoint presentation to

                       make it more appealing and to ensure that the students are interested in the topic of

                       the distance formula.

                              In the afternoon, I revised my detailed lesson plan and created an animated

                       PowerPoint presentation. I checked all the grammar and spelling both in my lesson

                       plan and presentation. I looked up how to include moving objects or figures in my

                       presentation  and  discovered  that  I  needed  to  download  a  gif  to  include  moving


                       objects.  I  am  happy  that  I  can  make  a  presentation  as  per  what  my  cooperating

                       teacher  requested.  After  checking  my  detailed  lesson  plan  and  presentation,  I

                       submitted a copy to my cooperating teacher.

                              In  the  evening,  I  sent  the  copy  of  my  lesson  plan  to  my  adviser  for  the

                       panelists. She asked me to create a Google link because she needed to forward it to


                       the panelists of my final demonstration tomorrow. I created the link with the help of

                       my classmate and submitted it to my adviser. At the same time, I feel nervous about

                       my final demonstration, and I hope everything will be fine.]]></page><page Index="465"><![CDATA[52


                       Day 60: 12 January 2022

                              This  is  it!  The  decisive  moment!  It  is  a  special  day  for  me  as  a  student

                       teacher. A day that I will never forget, and I will cherish forever. This is the day that I

                       cried  so  hard  after  my  final  demonstration.  I  cried  because  I  am  so  happy  that  I


                       successfully  did my  final  demonstration despite having  no  sleep at all.  I  could not

                       sleep due to overthinking about my final demo. Even though I closed my eyes, my

                       brain was still memorizing the flow of my lesson plan. I am so helpless that whatever

                       I did to make myself sleep was not working; I  could not sleep until the time for my

                       final demo came. I have no choice but to trust in God that I will be able to do it.

                              I took a bath early and prepared all the devices that I would use for my final


                       demo. I also organized my virtual aids on my desk. I put ink in my whiteboard marker

                       to make my handwriting on the board clear and readable to my students. At 7:50 am,

                       I sent the Google link to my cooperating teacher and waited for them to join in the

                       Google  classroom.  At  8:00  a.m.,  all  my  students  arrived;  they  were  also  excited

                       about my final demo, so instead of taking their break time, they came early to our

                       online classroom to support my final demo. We waited for my panelists from CvSU -


                       Tanza Campus.

                              After  discussion,  all  the  panelists  evaluated  my  performance  in  my  final

                       demonstration teaching. Ma’am Gerry Mae Silvero and Ma’am Mary Joy  Angelique

                       Mojica are my panelists from CvSU -Tanza Campus, while Ma’am Loraine Oblipias

                       and  Sir  Christopher  Lim  are  panelists  from  Dawn  Amadis  Christian  School.  I

                       appreciated all the comments and suggestions that came from the panelists, and I

                       promised them that I would do it when the time comes that I am a teacher. I am so


                       thankful to know my weaknesses and strengths as a teacher from my panelists. I am

                       forever  thankful,  and  I  will  never  forget  those  words  that  I  heard  from  them.  I

                       appreciated all the negative and positive comments, which will be extremely helpful

                       for me to improve myself as a teacher someday.]]></page><page Index="466"><![CDATA[53


                                                 COMMON CLASSROOM PROBLEMS



                              The pandemic has had an impact on our educational systems, leading to the

                       implementation of various learning approaches, including synchronous classes (Zalat


                       et  al.,  2021).  An  internet  connection  is  essentials  for  synchronous  class

                       implementation, but unfortunately, our country is well known for having poor internet

                       connections.  Synchronous  classes  taught  in  real  time,  which  causes  problems

                       (Amadora, 2020).

                              During my internship, the most common classroom problems I encountered


                       were mostly technical difficulties. There are days when my internet connection is so

                       poor that I am unable to share my presentation with the class. I also could not see if

                       my students were still paying attention to our class discussion because their cameras

                       turned off on my monitor. My students occasionally complain that they could not see

                       the lecture that I wrote on the white board because it blurred due to my poor internet

                       connection. It is also my problem that I have an out-dated laptop. My laptop does not

                       allow me to use video in Google Meet; if I open my camera, it becomes blurry, and I


                       am unable to present my presentation. I am struggling at the beginning of my actual

                       teaching because it is important that, as a teacher, my students see me while also

                       seeing the lecture on the whiteboard. My cooperating teacher suggests that I submit

                       my presentation to her before class discussion so that if I am unable to present it,

                       she can share it with the class while I am discussing it. She also instructed me to use


                       two devices  during  class discussions,  so  I  used my  laptop  to monitor my  students

                       and share my presentation while using my phone to ensure that they saw me and

                       that the lectures or solutions to the given problem that I wrote on the whiteboard were

                       visible  and  readable.  I  am  so  glad  that  I  was  able  to  finish  the  class  discussion

                       successfully  despite  of  technical  difficulties  that  I  encountered  throughout  the

                       internship.]]></page><page Index="467"><![CDATA[54


                                             FINAL DEMONSTRATION TEACHING



                              The  final  demonstration  teaching  is  the  most  important  part  for  a  student-

                       teacher. All my efforts throughout the internship will evaluated at this point. A panel


                       from  Cavite  State  University  -Tanza  Campus  and  Dawn  Amadis  Christian  School,

                       Inc. would observe my performance during my final demonstration teaching. This is a

                       moment that I will not ever forget in my entire life.

                              The  most  difficult  aspect  of  this  final  demonstration  is  the  preparation.  It

                       required me to consider which activities aligned with the lesson's learning objectives


                       and would be appropriate for the allotted time for demo teaching, since it is important

                       that I have enough time for preparation. My cooperating teacher informed me that the

                       last day of my actual teaching was December 17, 2021, and that because she is the

                       one who will facilitate the second periodic test of the students that I  managed and

                       because it was their last week of having classes, I must use the remaining week to

                       create  a  lesson  plan.  I  would  check  my  email  to  see  if  she  sent  the  copy  of  the

                       Distance Formula lesson, but there is no message, so  I will have to wait until she


                       does.


                              Even though the Christmas break was over, I still did not have a copy of the

                       lesson that I planned to use in my final demo. I decided to ask Kuya Nathaniel for a

                       favor, and he agreed to send me a copy of the lesson that I would use in my final


                       demo on January 12, 2022. I felt relieved when I received the lesson. I am curious

                       why my cooperating teacher did not send it even though she knows I need it because

                       she  is  the  one  who  told  me  to  use  the  lesson  from  their  book.  Fortunately,  I

                       remembered how to make a lesson plan from my previous subject, so I followed its

                       format.  I  begin  by  developing  a  lesson  plan  and  determining  which  activities  are

                       appropriate for the learning objectives. Since the learning objective of the lesson from

                       the book was only in the cognitive and psychomotor  domains, I must consider the]]></page><page Index="468"><![CDATA[55


                       affective domain. I get ideas for my activities from learning materials that I download

                       from the internet. I submitted a semi-detailed lesson plan to my cooperating teacher,

                       who said she would call me for feedback. She called me two days before the classes

                       started to give me feedback and suggestions for my lesson plan. She informed me


                       that I did not include an affective domain in my learning objectives and suggested

                       that I use the keyword "appreciate" to make it. And when she noticed that I did not

                       have recalling for the previous lesson, I told her that instead of recalling the lesson, I

                       will conduct an activity related to my topic as my motivation, but if I must recall the

                       lesson, I will remove the said activity. She replied that there was no need to remove


                       the activity since she liked it, but she suggested that I use real-life images to illustrate

                       my activities rather than shapes. When it comes to my application, it is essential that

                       I can conduct a group activity, even in an online setting, and to make it local, I must

                       use places in my activity that are familiar to my students for them to appreciate the

                       topic. She also suggests that I use moving objects in my presentation because since

                       we  live  in a  digital  world,  I  should  know  how to create a  presentation  with moving

                       objects  to  pique  the  students'  interest.  Lastly,  she  told  me  that  she  wants  me  to


                       create a detailed lesson plan and submit it before the class begins. She allowed me

                       to do a dry run for my final demonstration teaching with Grade 9 students on the first

                       day of classes to see if I could follow the flow of my lesson plan because she knew I

                       had not practiced it in my actual teaching. I listened intently and took careful notes on

                       all her comments and suggestions.



                              I was disappointed after doing the dry run for my final demonstration teaching

                       because I did not finish the content of my lesson plan. I am worried that it happened

                       during my actual final demonstration teaching. My cooperating teacher called me that

                       day and told me to address an issue in the activity to save time. She gives me a hints

                       and  tips  on  how  to  manage  my  time  during  my  actual  demonstration  teaching.  I

                       asked  her  permission  to  remove  the  affective  domain  from  my  learning  objectives]]></page><page Index="469"><![CDATA[56


                       after realizing that it was incorrect because the word "appreciates" is not measurable

                       and I should avoid using it in the lesson plan; she agreed and replied that she had

                       forgotten about it. I immediately finalize and submit my lesson plan and PowerPoint

                       presentation to my cooperating teacher.


                              The hardest part of my life is when I cannot sleep the night before my final

                       demonstration teaching because my brain is still memorizing my detailed lesson plan

                       even when I close my eyes. I feel so helpless; I want to sleep, but I cannot. I did not

                       know  what  to  do;  I  even  prayed  for  a  peaceful  night,  but  my  mind  could  not  stop

                       thinking.  I  have  nothing  else  to  do  but  cry.  I  decided  to  take  a  bath  early  in  the


                       morning and prepare my laptop and phone. Since my laptop would not work if I used

                       Google Meet with an open camera, I used it only for my presentation and to monitor

                       my  students,  while  I  used  my  phone  to  show  the  solution  from  the  board.  I  also

                       checked my internet connection to see if it was stable. I am so nervous that I cannot

                       even  eat  my  breakfast  because  I  am  having  stomach  pains  and  diarrhea.  I  took

                       medicine for diarrhea and prayed hard to God to take away all my worries and give

                       me strength for my final demo teaching. I entered the Google Meet at 7:55 a.m., and


                       luckily, my cooperating teacher and students came at 8:00 a.m. I am grateful for their

                       support for my final demo; even though I told them we would start at 8:15 a.m., they

                       came in to cheer me on and wish me luck. My students have assured me that they

                       will do their absolute best for me. I was so motivated when I heard them, and it gave

                       me confidence.


                              Ms. Mary Joy Angelique Mojica and Ms. Gerry Mae T. Silvero are panelists

                       from  Cavite  State  University-Tanza  Campus,  while  Mr.  Christopher  Lim  and  my

                       cooperating teacher are from Dawn Amadis Christian School. We waited for Ma'am

                       Mary Joy because my cooperating teacher had instructed me to wait for her before

                       beginning to discuss. When Ma'am Mary Joy entered the Google Meet, I started the

                       discussion without looking at the time, which was incorrect because I did not know

                       what time I started or when I was going to end the discussion. I am extremely happy]]></page><page Index="470"><![CDATA[57


                       that mostly of my students participated in our class discussion. If they have asked a

                       question, they raise their hand and do their best to answer it. I know I gave them a

                       brief time to complete all the activities because I am worried that I will not be able to

                       finish and implement all the content from my lesson plan. As a result, few students


                       did not finish answering the given problem, and I felt sorry for them because, as we

                       discussed previously, I always give them enough time to finish their activities and I

                       always consider their capabilities, but this time I know I made a mistake. I promised

                       myself that if I became a teacher, I would never do it again because it is important

                       that I always consider my students' feelings. But there is one thing I will never forget:


                       when one of my students asked me a question and I did not know how to answer it. I

                       was so astounded by his question that I did not expect him to ask it. On the other

                       hand, our class discussion went well, and I was relieved that we did not encounter

                       any technical difficulties. I know I did my best to finish it, and whatever the outcome

                       is, I will gladly accept it.

                              Evaluation  is  the  final  part  of  my  final  demo  teaching.  Before  the  panelists

                       assessed  my  performance,  we  waited  until  all  my  students  had  left  Google  Meet.


                       Ma'am  Mary  Joy  Mojica  began  the  evaluation  by  congratulating  me  on  a  job  well

                       done  and  a  successful  demo  teaching,  and  then  she  commented  on  things  that

                       needed to improve. She advises that if I use a timer, it must be visible to my students

                       for them to be aware of the time, and that if my students do not want to participate, I

                       must always encourage them. And as a teacher, I must allow them to participate and


                       not tolerate students who refuse to participate. Finally, she suggests that because I

                       used  localization,  I  must  use  a  real-life  unit  of  measurement  next  time.  On  the

                       positive side, she praised me for using localization, which made the students familiar

                       with the locations that I used in the activity, and she noticed that I had a mastery of

                       the  lesson,  and  she  finally  told  me  that  the  demo  teaching  was  very  good  and

                       advised me to practice more to remove the regional accent.]]></page><page Index="471"><![CDATA[58


                              Ma'am Gerry Mae T. Silvero was the next evaluator, and she told me that the

                       authority she  saw  in my demo  teaching  was still  there. She  told me  that  I have  a

                       good voice, one that is very modulated and pleasant to hear. She also praised and

                       stated  that  I  have excellent  classroom  management, particularly at  the  start of the


                       discussion,  and  that  the  discussion  flows  smoothly.  She  claims  that  I  have  a

                       cognitive, interactive, and conducive learning environment. She also complimented

                       and congratulated me on having a detailed lesson plan, which she said was difficult

                       to  create.  She  also  appreciates  how  I  used  the  whiteboard  in  group  work  and  to

                       discuss the lesson. Finally, she congratulated me and stated that there was no dull


                       moment during my class discussion.

                              Mr. Christopher Lim also liked my voice; he stated that he wants a modulated

                       voice for a teacher who can persuade students to listen to him. He also noticed that I

                       have proficiency in the subject matter. He praised everything  about my final demo,

                       from  the  beginning  to  the  end  of  the  discussion,  including  my  learning  objectives,

                       activities, discussions, and how I delivered the lessons. He suggests that I call all my

                       students' attention to ensure that they all listen and understand the lesson. Finally, he


                       commends me on a job well done and wishes me success in public school. While my

                       cooperating teacher congratulated me on a job well done, she also stated that the

                       discussion completed in 50 minutes, which is very quick for her. She told me that I

                       am particularly good at conducting activities, but she noticed that I did not give other

                       students a chance to finish their activity. She impressed me so much that when one


                       of my students asked me a question, I was able to respond right away. And lastly,

                       she told me that I am a great listener and that I know how to share my ideas with her,

                       which she learned from me, and that she will never forget me as her student teacher.

                               I  appreciated  all  my  panelists'  comments  and  suggestions  and  promised

                       them that I would do my best to become a great teacher someday. I am so grateful to

                       know all my weaknesses and strengths; they will help me improve, and  I will keep

                       them in my mind and heart forever.]]></page><page Index="472"><![CDATA[59


                                       OVERALL REFLECTION AND SELF-APPRAISAL





                              What can I say about myself now that I have completed the student-teaching

                       program? Well, I am glad I was able to take this student teaching program because it

                       helped  shape  me  into  a  better  person  as  a  future  teacher.  According  to  Leo

                       Buscaglia as cited in Rodenhizer (2018), change is the result of all true learning. And

                       I learned because there is a change in me. When I first found out that I would have to

                       take an internship during my third year of college, while attending a farewell party for


                       outgoing students and hearing about their internship experiences, I was so excited

                       and hopeful that I would have those same experiences and prayed that I would be

                       able to face those struggles successfully. And now that I am also a student teacher, I

                       must admit that it is not easy at first but having the determination to do the things that

                       will make me a better person is part of learning and changing.

                              My cooperating teacher noticed that I had a problem with pronunciation at the


                       beginning of my actual teaching. I was so sad, and I am still wondering why it is so

                       difficult to pronounce the word correctly. I am so shy that I mispronounced the word,

                       which is a problem for me because, as a teacher, it is important that I know how to

                       pronounce the word correctly because I am the one who will teach it to the students.

                       So, I kept practicing by reading and studying the proper pronunciation of the words

                       on Google and YouTube. I also decided to read stories, news, and journals aloud so


                       that  everyone  in my house  could hear me  and correct me  if  I  pronounced  a  word

                       incorrectly, and I decided to do it every day. I also noticed that it was difficult for me

                       to write on the white board while my body  was not blocking the camera, so I kept

                       writing on the board while my body was in the proper position and was not blocking

                       the camera until my hand became flexible wherever my body positioned. At first, it

                       was also my problem to know how to see my students while presenting the lesson

                       because, in the past, when I presented the lesson as a reporter, I  did not see my]]></page><page Index="473"><![CDATA[60


                       classmates.  All  I  saw  was  my  presentation,  and  since  I  needed  to  call  out  my

                       students  while  discussing  the  lesson,  I  needed  to  know  about  it.  To  solve  my

                       problem, I directly asked my cooperating teacher how to present a slide while seeing

                       my students at the same time, and she told me that I needed to present my slide in a


                       reading view mode so that I could see my students while presenting it.  I am happy

                       that  she  can  assist  me  in  this  matter,  and  I  felt  relieved.  In  terms  of  making  a

                       presentation, I did not know how to include moving objects in the slide, so I only used

                       images and plain figures. I was curious about everything, so I asked my cooperating

                       teacher about how they assess students, how they create written activities, quizzes,


                       and long tests. I am so glad I was able to properly teach the lesson, and I am happy

                       when my students get passing grades because it means they understand  me, and

                       my  teaching  method  was  effective.  My  goal  is  to  have  a  positive  relationship  with

                       both  my  cooperating  teacher  and  my  students.  When  it  comes  to  my  cooperating

                       teacher, I always consider her feelings; I am afraid she will be mad at me, so I always

                       consider if it is okay to ask those questions, and because she is busy, I make sure I

                       message  her  at  the  appropriate  time.  Concerning  my  students,  I  approach  them


                       politely to ensure that they are comfortable with me. I am afraid they will be unhappy

                       with me or that they will not like me, so I tried my best to be nice to them.

                              At the start of my internship, I had the impression that my cooperating teacher

                       did not like the idea of having a student teacher; I had the feeling that she did not like

                       me,  that  I  was  only  disturbing  her  or  that  I  was  not  helping  her,  which  made  her


                       difficult as my cooperating teacher. I had the perception that she was worried that I

                       would oversee her class. I am so sad about feeling unwelcome, but I do not have a

                       choice but to have a good relationship with her. So, I decided to gain her trust and

                       demonstrate  to  her  that  I  can  do  what  she  does  for  her  class.  I  understand  how

                       difficult it is to gain the trust of someone you do not know and with whom you cannot

                       speak personally. All I did was my best; I am afraid that my cooperating teacher or

                       cooperating school will make negative comments about me that will reflect negatively]]></page><page Index="474"><![CDATA[61


                       on my school. I keep reminding myself to do my best to make them like me and be

                       proud of me, so that they will consider my internship useful to their school. I followed

                       all my cooperating teacher's suggestions, and sometimes I shared ideas for our class

                       discussion  and  asked  her  permission  if  it  was  okay  with  her.  I  always  offer  my


                       assistance and tell her that it is fine if it is not related to math subjects if I can help

                       her, and it also helps me gain knowledge.

                              After the internship, I am so proud of myself because my pronunciation has

                       improved.  My  regional  accent  has  not  completely  vanished,  but  there  has  been  a

                       change. And now I correctly pronounce the words that I used to mispronounce. I was


                       also able to present my slide while supervising my students on my laptop. Previously,

                       I could only use shapes and simple images in my presentation, but now I can make it

                       more interesting because I know how to include moving objects in my PowerPoint

                       presentation. Through this, I learned how to  professionally write on the whiteboard

                       without  obstructing  the  camera.  I  also  know  how  to  assess  my  students  and

                       determine  their  strengths  and  weaknesses.  I  can  motivate  my  students  and  keep

                       them  focused  on  the  lessons. As a teacher,  I  boosted my  level  of  confidence  and


                       demonstrated authority to my students. I demonstrate proficiency in the lesson, which

                       has been consistent since the beginning of my internship. I learned so many different

                       teaching strategies for teaching mathematics in online settings that I have no idea

                       what happened in an online classroom of a private school. I am so proud of myself

                       for being able to teach subjects other than mathematics. I learned that as a teacher, I


                       must be adaptable and know how to teach subjects other than my specialty. I also

                       learned to be patient with students who constantly ask for clarification; as a teacher,

                       it is my responsibility to ensure that all my students gain knowledge from every class

                       discussion. In terms of lesson plans, I learned that I must consider localization, which

                       I had no idea about before, and now that I create a lesson plan, I always consider it.

                              In  terms  of  my  relationship  with  my  cooperating  teacher,  I  happy  that  she

                       appreciated all my efforts. She noticed my ability, attitude, and skills, which I display]]></page><page Index="475"><![CDATA[62


                       in  every  class  discussion.  I  learned  how  to  have  a  good  relationship  with  other

                       teachers and be respectful, which I believe will be useful when I become a teacher

                       someday, especially since I will be interacting with my co-teachers daily. I understood

                       my  cooperating  teacher's  concerns  before  because  it  is  not  easy  to  deal  with  the


                       various  students  while  their  parents  are  watching  over  them.  I  am  aware  that

                       whatever action I take reflects on the school. I am so grateful for allowing me to have

                       an  unforgettable  experience  that  allows  me  to  feel  like  a  true  teacher.  It  is  a

                       wonderful feeling when my students address me as "ma'am." I was undecided about

                       becoming  a  teacher before, telling myself  that  I  did not  want  to  teach and  instead


                       would apply for a government job, but after experiencing student teaching, I realized

                       that I want to be a teacher, and I want to hear those students greet me and call me

                       ma'am. The excitement of receiving a message from someone asking for help and

                       wanting  to  learn  from  me  is  incredible,  and  now  that  I  have  experienced  being  a

                       student teacher and all the learning and suggestions that I have gained from it, I can

                       confidently say that I am prepared to be a teacher someday.]]></page><page Index="476"><![CDATA[63

                 The lesson is very well organized and well implemented.
                 The lesson was delivered in a way that is relatable for the students.
                 Instructions regarding activities are clear and easy to follow.
                 The student teacher demonstrated proficiency with the use of the English language.
                 The student teacher did well guiding student(s) who answered in Filipino.
                 The student teacher showed enjoyment interacting with the students.






                 None so far.
                 The student teacher did a remarkable job handling the class and I believe he is more than ready to enter the teaching profession. Always strive to improve
                 your craft by trying out a variety of teaching strategies, keeping up with the changes in the field of education, and being mindful of the needs of your
                 students.

                 Sir Ariel has this charisma and a well-modulated voice that motivate his students to listen and participate actively in the class. Students were engaged and
                 since they were always being commended with their answers, I think this made the students become more interested in involving in the discussion.












                 None for me so far. Sir Ariel is more than prepared to be in the classroom and teach.

                 The Practice Teacher have mastered the subject matter and uses the medium of instruction.

                 The Practice Teacher was able to follow the main objectives of the lesson plan and was able to execute the teaching properly.

                 He was able to address the problems of the students and gives solution when it needs to be.

                 He is an efficient and effective teacher in the class.




                 The Practice Teacher should have project the given assessment even more for the students were a bit startled at the end of the lesson. It should be time
                 bound.

                 The teacher should avoid repetitive merit used for the students' performance or participation.

                 As I observed to my student-teacher, Sir Bernard Pante, he used appropriate teaching and learning resources to achieve the needs of the learners. He
                 made the class lively and participative by using different online games. He also applied positive behavior during distance learning.












                 On the other hand, he needs to improve his grammar when speaking ang writing.

                 In general, he performed well during the practice teaching. Job well done!

                 The teacher still proceeds no matter what and she completely masters the content of the lesson. She's a lot more confident than she used to be. Kudos to
                 her for thinking of the flow of the lesson. Congratulations Ma'am Gia!












                 Again, ma'am please work on your art of questioning. Knowledge should not just come from you. Some students were able to give a valid point at the
                 beginning, but I felt like you need to further draw it into the big picture by accepting the point and asking further questions. Also, try to avoid distractions. Do
                 not be easily flustered. Try to simplify your concepts so the students can easily grasp them.

                 The teacher was able to make the class interactive despite the online set-up. She also showed incomparable patience with the technical difficulties that
                 came her way. She was approachable and her voice was good for the students to be not afraid of her. Her PowerPoint presentation was creative, colorful,
                 and interactive too; it was not dull and adhered to the principles of making a PowerPoint presentation. She was prepared and had a pleasing personality.
                 She did not forget to recognize students' efforts and answers. Generally, from the first day up to her demonstration teaching,, she is responsible and can
                 really be a great teacher in the future.







                 The student teacher needs to improve her grammar and fluency but with consistent practice, I believe she will still improve in these aspects and areas
                 because I also saw her improvements as time passed by. I think she also needs to be strict sometimes, especially during face to face classes, because if
                 she is always too kind and soft to students, they might abuse her kindness.

                 The teacher demonstrated creativity in constructing lessons that are engaging and meaningful to the students. She showed keen awareness on the kind of
                 activities that best suits students' interests. She also manifested strong mastery of the learning content during her teaching lessons. She was eager to
                 learn, honest, and passionate with what she does.










                 For improvement, the teacher may consider simplifying and contextualizing the assessment and break down further the lecture part of the lesson. Other
                 than that, the teacher did well in her practicum. Congratulations!

                 The teacher is kind and approachable with her students. She is also patient with her students and I can see how she wants to impart her knowledge with
                 them.












                 She is a little bit nervous that causes delay with some part of the lesson. She needs to practice more and be prepared always whenever she is teaching.
                 Also, she should separate personal problems when it comes to work. Be an optimistic person.

                 Ms. Reyes really has the mastery of the topic.She gave examples that will really help the students to understand more the topic. Although, it’s very difficult
                 to present a Math Lesson online, she delivered it very well and still engaged the learners throughout the lesson.












                 It’s hard to show the answer just through the camera. Maybe it would be easier for the students to send their answers via comment box or let them present
                 so everyone can see their answers.

                 The pre-service teacher shows enthusiasm in the class, which leads to having participative students. He also points out and corrects students' mistakes
