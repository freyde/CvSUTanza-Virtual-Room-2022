According     from    the    website    of                 https://teaching.utoronto.ca/teaching-support/course-design/developing-learning-                 outcomes/what-are-learning-outcomes , Learning outcomes are statements that describe the                 knowledge or  skills  students  should acquire by  the end  of  a  particular assignment,  class,                  course, or program, and help students understand why that knowledge and those skills will                 be useful to them.                          The purpose of having program learning outcomes is to describe of the knowledge,                 competencies  and  values  of  students  to  displays  at  the  end  of  the  program  and  help                 students  connect  their  learning  to  various  situations  and  guide  the  selection of evaluation                 methods. A purpose of having course learning outcomes is to articulate to students, faculty,                  and other stakeholders what students will achieve in each course and how their learning will                 be measured, while the purpose of having intended learning outcomes is to define what a                 learner will have acquired and will be able to do upon successfully completing their studies.                 The  difference  of  program  learning  outcomes,  course  learning  outcomes  and  intended                 learning  outcomes;  a  program  learning  outcomes  are  the  expectation  for  what  students                 should acquire and able to do from their program, like for example learning outcomes of the                  students in their program Bachelor of Secondary in Education major in Mathematics, and the                 course learning outcomes are the expectation for what students should acquire and able to                 do  at  the  end  of  their  course  like  for  example  learning  outcomes  of  the  students  whose                 taking  a subject of Calculus 2, while the intended learning outcomes are  the objective of the                 lesson, It is an expectation for what  students should acquire and able to do at the end of the                 lesson.                          Program  learning  outcomes,  course  learning  outcomes  and  intended  learning                  outcomes are important; it is not possible to deliver a lesson without them because they are                 integrated  in  each  other  which  important  in  making  curriculum  map  in  order  to  deliver  a                 lesson aligned for what the student’s need to acquire at the end of a program, course and                 after their class.","TTTC-CF-03                                                Republic of the Philippines                                         CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY                                                     Tanza Campus                                                 Bagtas, Tanza, Cavite                                                     (046) 414-3979                                                      www.cvsu.edu.ph                                              Teacher Education Department                                            Second Semester, A.Y. 2020-2021                                                  FINAL EXAMINATION                                  BSEE 26: Language Learning Materials Development                  Name: ___________________________________________________  Score: _______________                 Course \& Section: __________________________________________  Date: ________________                                                  Rubric for Teaching Vlog                   Component        Transforming       Developing        Emerging         Beginning     Score                  A.

Feel free to                quote or cite some sources but be sure to reference these ideas properly.                     1.  How is inclusive education different from special education?                    2.  Upon reading DepEd Order No.21 s. 2019 Annex 5, what can you suggest for a better                        inclusive education in the Philippines? Do not forget to cite some readings that will                         make your suggestion reliable.

Ursabia                                                    Course\&Section: BEE1-1                          Special education is a form of learning that is provided to the students with mental                challenges or learning disabilities. It is also called as special needs education, because it                 serves children with emotional, behavioral, cognitive impairments such as problem in hearing,                vision,  or  speech.  The  gifted  children  who  are  advanced  in  academic  learning  are  also                 included in special education. While, the inclusive education is a form of learning that provides                a fair treatment to the students regardless to the challenge that they have. This education are                also  called  inclusion  which  means  that  all  students  are  included,  even  if  the  student  are                 disabled or non-disabled students.                        As a student, I suggest that we must continue to have inclusive education in our country                 so that people who needs this kind of education would be more comfortable while having a                learning stage. I also suggest that we need to communicate to them and teach them well if                they are having a hard time in coping up about the lesson so that they can develop their skills                 and knowledge in such things. I believe that they can do well, if there’s a person or facilitator                that can guide them and to make them feel that they’re not different to other people in the                class.  “Inclusion in education is viewed as “a dynamic approach of responding positively to                 pupil diversity and of seeing individual differences not as problems, but as opportunities for                enriching learning.” (UNESCO, 2005).” This quotation from UNESCO proves that people must                have not seen differences as a problem, instead this must be their way to teach or to give                 learning to people who needs it.                        We  must  be  sensitive  enough  and  respect  other  people,  we  must  not  treat  them                 different because we should be fair in treatment especially in having inclusive education."];
