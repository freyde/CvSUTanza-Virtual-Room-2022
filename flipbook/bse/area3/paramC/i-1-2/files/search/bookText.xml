               1-Page Reflection Paper (Due March 22, 2021)


               Answer the reflection question below clearly and concisely. You are also encouraged to do


               more readings on assessment and evaluation of learning in Mathematics. Feel free quote or

               cite some sources but be sure to reference these ideas properly.

                   1.  What  is  the  purpose  of  having  program  learning  outcomes,  course  learning

                       outcomes, and intended learning outcomes? How are they different to each other? Is

                       it possible to deliver a lesson without those? Why or why not?




               Instructions for Submission:

                   1.  Use a standard 11-point font, Arial, double-spaced page. Submit your paper via the

               https://teaching.utoronto.ca/teaching-support/course-design/developing-learning-

               outcomes/what-are-learning-outcomes , Learning outcomes are statements that describe the

               knowledge or  skills  students  should acquire by  the end  of  a  particular assignment,  class,


               course, or program, and help students understand why that knowledge and those skills will

               be useful to them.


                       The purpose of having program learning outcomes is to describe of the knowledge,

               competencies  and  values  of  students  to  displays  at  the  end  of  the  program  and  help

               students  connect  their  learning  to  various  situations  and  guide  the  selection of evaluation

               methods. A purpose of having course learning outcomes is to articulate to students, faculty,


               and other stakeholders what students will achieve in each course and how their learning will

               be measured, while the purpose of having intended learning outcomes is to define what a

               learner will have acquired and will be able to do upon successfully completing their studies.

               The  difference  of  program  learning  outcomes,  course  learning  outcomes  and  intended

               learning  outcomes;  a  program  learning  outcomes  are  the  expectation  for  what  students

               should acquire and able to do from their program, like for example learning outcomes of the


               students in their program Bachelor of Secondary in Education major in Mathematics, and the

               course learning outcomes are the expectation for what students should acquire and able to

               do  at  the  end  of  their  course  like  for  example  learning  outcomes  of  the  students  whose

               taking  a subject of Calculus 2, while the intended learning outcomes are  the objective of the

               lesson, It is an expectation for what  students should acquire and able to do at the end of the

               lesson.


                       Program  learning  outcomes,  course  learning  outcomes  and  intended  learning


               outcomes are important; it is not possible to deliver a lesson without them because they are

               integrated  in  each  other  which  important  in  making  curriculum  map  in  order  to  deliver  a

               lesson aligned for what the student’s need to acquire at the end of a program, course and

               after their class.]]></page><page Index="11"><![CDATA[Gra                      ded Rubric]]></page><page Index="12"><![CDATA[TTTC-CF-03
