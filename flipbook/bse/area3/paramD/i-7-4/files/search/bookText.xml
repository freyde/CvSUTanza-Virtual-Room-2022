                                     This course is a continuation of Field Study 1. It is school based and
                              allows a pre-service student to participate and assist in a limited actual

                              teaching-learning activities that relate to assessment of learning, preparation
                              of instructional materials, preparation of the bulletin boards, and other
                              routines in the classroom. A portfolio which will contain sample lesson or

                              learning plans and demonstration teaching of at least one subject content
                              area will be required. An action research shall be encouraged to start in this

                              course and conclude during the internship.

                         My Intended Learning Outcomes

                                After the completion of the lesson, the students should be able to:
                                1. write the different activities related to learning teaching through
                                   assisting teaching;

                                2. make a short video demonstration teaching; and
                                3. create sample lesson plan and modules



                         My Learning Essentials
                                Activity allows pre-service teachers to learn more about the lesson by

                         searching and reading more the subject. It's important to help the cooperating
                         teacher find the right teaching materials. This practice will help a teacher-to-be
                         learn how to choose educational materials that meet the needs of each student.

                         The information in Preparing Instructional Materials shows what you need to
                         know and do. It talks about different kinds of teaching materials and gives
                         detailed information, such as examples, definitions, and other things. Pre-

                         service teachers practice making IMs for their students that are creative and
                         look good. Assisting in Preparing Bulletin Board and Learning Station is

                         Assisting in preparing bulletin boards and learning station display is another way
                         of helping our cooperating teacher. It lets us use our creativity to make a bulletin
                         board and learning station that is useful, attractive, and powerful. In this activity,

                         it's important to listen to what the CT says about how to make it. They are the
                         one who can teach us how to be a teacher.

                                        Okay, I see!

                                        Laws or rules are obligatory to
                                        observe to guide you to get a point,
                                        and the violation of the law means the
                                        wrongdoings. Right?

                                        In mathematics, there are also laws
                                        that we must follow, especially when it
                                        involves exponents.

                                        So, today we are going to discuss
                                        different laws of exponents using our

                                        Exponent is number or symbol written
                                        at the upper right of the base.

                                        So, here’s the illustration. As you can
                                        see the bigger number is what we call  (attentively listen to the teacher)
                                        the base and the symbol written above
                                        and to the right of the base is the
                                        exponent. Then, 5 is what we call the
                                                        2
                                        power.

                                        Lets have an examples of exponent.
                                        5² = 5x5 = 25. It means that 5 is
                                                                  2
                                        exponential form of the number 25.
                                        Next, 3³ = 3 x 3 x 3 = 27. The 3 3
                                        means 3 factor of 3.

                                        Therefore, exponent denotes the
                                        number we multiply the base to itself.
                                        Lets proceed to the laws of exponents.
                                        So, we have the product law, quotient
                                        law, power of a power, power of a
                                        product, power of a quotient, negative
                                        exponent and zero exponent. These
                                        laws are used in simplifying
                                        mathematical expressions.

                                        Now, lets start to the product law. This
                                        is use when we multiply expressions
                                        that have the same base. Just like this
                                                   
                                                   ×      =    + 
                                        So, we have the same base a with
                                        exponent n and m. To multiply this, we
                                        just simply copy the base and add
                                        their exponents. Lets have a concrete
                                        examples.
                                        Examples:
                                        1.) 3 ●3 = 3 2+3 =3 5
                                            2
                                               3
                                        How about this who wants to try?
                                        2.) a ● a =                           May I try?

                                                                                     10
                                                                                  4
                                                                              2.) a ● a = a 4+10 =a 14
                                        Okay, that right!
                                        Very good! Thank you so much!
                                        So, as you can see the purpose of this
                                        lesson is for you to just be familiar with
                                        the different laws.
                                        The next law is the quotient law. This
                                        is used when you divide the same

                                        same base, we just copy the base and
                                        subtract their exponents.

                                        Lets have these:

                                        1)        =     −   =    
                                              


                                       Now, try this one. Who wants to try?   Ma’am I want to try.

                                        Go a head ms.--
                                                                              I only follow the law . I just copy
                                        Okay, very good ms---. now, how did   the base and subtract it.
                                        you get it?
                                        That’s right!
                                        Next law is what we call the power of
                                        a product. Another term for exponent
                                        is what we call a power. This is called
                                        a power of a product because there is
                                        a product here.
                                        a times b then you raise to a power n.
                                        So, to do these you will simply

                                              3
                                        How about?
                                        2.) (5yz) =                           Ma’am

                                        answer?                               exponent to each factor.
                                        Okay, that’s right

                                        Next, a power of a quotient. This is
                                        called a power of a quotient because
                                        there is a division expression here.
                                        You need to distribute the exponent to
                                        the numerator and denominator.

                                        power of a power. This law use when
                                        the expression has already a power or
                                        exponent and then, we raised it again
                                        to another power or another exponent.

                                        To do this, it simply copy the base and
                                        this time we multiply their exponent
                                        just like here.     (  ) =      
                                                                 
                                        Let's have a specific example. Here
                                                 2
                                        we have (6 ) raised to another power
                                        which is 3. Usually, we used
                                        parenthesis to separate those two
                                        exponents.

                                        To do this, we copy the base 6 and
                                        multiply their exponents 2x3 is 6. 6 6
                                        this one is 6 to the 6 power

                                        Negative Exponent
                                        Our next law is about a negative
                                        exponent. I said earlier that they not
                                        allow to have a negative exponent as
                                        the final answer. So, to become
                                        positive we need to write the
                                        reciprocal and make the exponent
                                        positive.
                                        This is the example, we have the base
                                         -n
                                        a the reciprocal are 1/a and we made
                                        the negative exponent into positive
                                        exponent.
                                        Let's have a concrete example here:
                                        1.) (6) , so we write the reciprocal of
                                             -1
                                        the base. The reciprocal of 6 is 1/6
                                        and then make the exponent positive
                                        so we can write positive 1/6 here or
                                                                1
                                        just leave at the blank so will have 1/6
                                        here.

                                        Now, try this one Ms.---
                                        2.) b -5                              2.) 1/b 5

                                        The last law is the Zero exponent, we
                                        never you encounter a base raised to
                                        the zero exponent and this is always
                                        equal to 1. Always remember that any
                                        number raised to zero is always equal
                                        to 1.

                   meter sticks? This module connects us to the history where we don’t have to
                   worry about our physical differences such as sizes of our palm and forearm

                   HISTORY OF MEASUREMENT

                            One of the earliest inventions of human beings was the unit of

                     measurement. In ancient times, people needed measurement to determine
                     how long or wide things are. They need to measure things to build their

                     houses or make their clothes. Later, units of measurement were used in

                     trade and commerce. In the 3rd century BC in Egypt, people used their body
                     parts to determine the measurements of things; the same body parts that

                     you used to measure the assigned things to you in Activity 1.



                            The forearm length was called a cubit. The handspan was considered
                     a half cubit, while the palm was considered 1 of a cubit. The Egyptians came
                                                                6
                     up with these 6 units to be more accurate in measuring different lengths.



                            However, using these units of measurement had a disadvantage. Not

                     everyone had the same forearm length. Discrepancies arose when the
                     people started comparing their measurements to one another because

                     measurements of the same thing differed, depending on who was measuring

                     it. Because of this, these units of measurement are called non-standard
                     units of measurement which later on evolved into what is now the inch, foot

                     and yard, the basic units of length in the English system of measurement.



                            The   results   of  measuring     are   merely    approximations    since

                     measurements are not always exact. Oftentimes, there is a relative error
                     involved.

                             1. The skill of the person doing the measurement. This

                             2. The precision of the instrument used in measuring.

                             This is totally dependent to the measuring device.





                            The English System of Measurement was widely used until the

                     1800s and the 1900s when the Metric System of Measurement started to

                     gain ground and became the most used system of measurement worldwide.
                     First described by Belgian Mathematician Simon Stevin in his booklet, De

                     Thiende (The Art of Tenths) and proposed by English philosopher, John
                     Wilkins, the Metric System of Measurement was first adopted by France in

                     1799. In 1875, the General Conference on Weights and Measures

                     (Conférence générale des poids et mesures or CGPM) was tasked to define
                     the different measurements. By 1960, CGPM released the International

                     System of Units (SI) which is now being used by majority of the countries
                     with the biggest exception being the United States of America. Since

                     Philippines used to be a colony of the United States, earlier Filipinos were

                     taught in the use of the English instead of the Metric System of
                     Measurement. Thus, they preferred English System rather than the Metric

                     System although the Philippines have already adopted the Metric System as
                     its official system of measurement.



                            The Metric System of Measurement is easier to use than the

                     English System of Measurement since its conversion factors would

                     consistently be in the decimal system, unlike the English System of
                     Measurement where units of lengths have different conversion factors. The

                     base unit for length is the meter and units longer or shorter than the meter
                     would be achieved by adding prefixes to the base unit. These prefixes may

                     also be used for the base units for mass, volume, time and other
                     measurements.

                              In both English and Metric system, there is a basic unit for length,

                       mass, volume, time, temperature and angle. Though these basic units are

                       still widely used, the adoption of the International System of Units will serve

                       it is performed.


                     Questions to ponder:
                          1. When a Filipina is described as 1.7 meters tall, would she be

                          considered tall or short? How about if she is described as 5 ft and 7
                          in tall, would she be considered tall or short?

                              Possibly, in measuring height, the use of feet and inches is more
                       familiar to you than that of meters because the English system is still

                       being widely used in the Philippines for this quantity.

                           In estimating measurement of angle, we need to recall

                    the different kinds of angles such as:
                                         1. Acute angle – angle whose measure is less than

                                            90°
                                         2. Right angle – angle whose measure is exactly 90°
                                         3. Obtuse angle - angle whose measure is more

                                            than 90°



                        1.    Estimate the measurement of the angle below. Use your

                        protractor to check your estimate.

                        2.    What difficulties did you meet in using your protractor to

                        measure the angles?

                        One of the difficulties you may encounter would be on the use of the protractor
                        and the angle orientation. Aligning the cross bar and base line of the protractor
                        with the vertex and an angle leg, respectively, might prove to be confusing at

                        first, especially if the angle opens in the clockwise orientation. Another difficulty
                        arises if the length of the leg is too short such that it won’t reach the tick marks
                        on the protractor. This can be remedied by extending the leg.





                        3.    What can be done to improve your skill in estimating angle
                        measurements?

                        You may familiarize yourself with the measurements of the common angles like

                        the angles in the first activity, and use these angles in estimating the

                        Zale, a Cebu resident, was packing his suitcase for his trip to New York
                        City the next day for a 2-week vacation. He googled New York weather

                        and found out the average temperature there is 15 C. Should he bring a

                        sweater? What data should Zale consider before making a decision?

                        1.    What data should Zale consider before making a decision?
                        In order to determine whether he should bring a sweater or not, Zale needs to

                        compare the average temperature in New York City to the temperature he is
                        used to which is the average temperature in Cebu. Compared average
                        temperatures should always be expressed in same units and be converted if it

                        differs.



                        2.    Should Zale bring a sweater?

                                 The average temperature in Cebu is between 24 – 32 C. Since the
                          average temperature in New York City is 15 C, Zale should probably bring a
                          sweater since the latter’s temperature is way below the temperature he is

                          used to. Better yet, he should bring a jacket just to be safe.

                               The concept of time is very basic and is integral in the discussion

                        of other concepts such as speed. Currently, there are two types of

                        notation in stating time, the 12-hr notation (standard time) or the 24-hr
                        notation (military or astronomical time). Standard time makes use of a.m.

                        and p.m. to distinguish between the time from 12midnight to 12 noon

                        (a.m. or ante meridiem) and from 12 noon to 12 midnight (p.m. or post
                        meridiem). This sometimes leads to ambiguity when the suffix of a.m.

                        and p.m. are left out. Military time prevents this ambiguity by using the
                        24-hour notation where the counting of the time continues all the way to

                              unit of measure for the object.

                          Learning Teaching Through Assisting is one of the lesson requirements for us
                   to equip as a teacher in the future. This lesson taught me the most important lesson,

                   such as assessing student learning, making lesson plans, putting up bulletin boards,
                   and other classroom tasks. It is considered one of the primary tasks a teacher must

                   learn because it applies to an actual teaching field. I believe that this will be essential
                   for us as future teachers.
                          The most interesting discoveries I made while taking the lesson were about how

                   to assist in a Cooperating School Online and what are the things that the teacher did in
                   an online classroom. It was exciting because I found out that teachers are a superhero.
                   They save the students' lives by providing them with the necessary knowledge despite

                   the situation. Searching for instructional materials, preparing instructional materials,
                   and assisting in preparing bulletin boards and learning stations are some ways that a
                   sidekick of a hero or assistant teacher can help them execute the class flow. As a

                   assistant teacher, I read more about the lesson that needs to put on IMs like
                   PowerPoint presentations. I search for additional information like the meaning and

                   other examples that we can use to help the student clearly understand the lesson.I also
                   spend time and effort, and patience for all destruction and wrong types of instructional
                   materials. I learned the advantages, limitations, and utilization in making the

                   Instructional Materials. Upon doing this activity, I realized that the instructional
                   materials we need to prepare must apply to their offered learning system. Since the

                   school provides online learning, we must create a presentable, clear, and informative
                   ppt for the students. On the other hand, we cannot do this activity since we are in an
                   online class. We spent our hours at home learning the things of a teacher online. There

                   is no bulletin that we need to prepare to assist our cooperating teacher. The only
                   bulletin board for the student is the official FB page of the school, where they can get
                   some announcements and information at home. I hope someday I will be able to

                   experience assisting in preparing bulletin boards. I know that it will be a big help for me
                   to motivate our students to learn and help me to show them that everywhere that we
                   can see inside the room provides a lesson.

                          Moreover, the best application of all the lessons that I have learned is to
                   practice them little by little and don't forget them because someday we will be used to

                   them. I also used my learning in this subject as a guide for becoming a good teacher.
                   Our future student will be the future of our nation, so we must provide a best quality
                   education for them. As a pre-service teacher I must always put in my heart the love for

                   teaching for me to bring out the best that I can do and the best that is deserve of them.

                   My Intended Learning Outcomes


                          After the completion of the lesson, the students should be able to:
                           1. write the different activities related to learning teaching through
                              participating; and

                   My Learning Essentials


                          It's important to stick to routines if we want to run a good classroom.

                   Participating in keeping classroom routines can help teachers stay on track and help

                   students feel more confident and at ease because they know what to expect in various

                   situations. With the help of my cooperating teacher, I learned that as an the assistant

                   teachers I also must take part in management routines even in an online setting. If

                   students practice it enough in class, it will go more smoothly and we won't have to

                   correct them as often, which will make my interactions with them better. Upon taking


                   this subject, I also learned that teachers are act as a guide, a mentor, and a leader for

                   both the task and the whole set of instructions. Teacher should also keep in mind that it

                   is up to the students to learn. People say that teachers shouldn't be the smartest

                   people on stage, but instead should be shown how to do their jobs. As pre-service

                   teachers, I should be there to help students and make sure that everyone is


                   participating and learning.

                          Allowing myself to participate in the classroom taught me many things about
                   being a teacher. Learning Teaching Through Participating let me experience the

                   situation in the school. In this lesson, we had a checklist and were in our cooperating
                   school online to fulfill the requirements of the subject. The provided checklist monitors

                   our experiences in our participation in the classroom. It guided us in the thing we must
                   do in our field study. Now, I will share with you through this paper my reflection and
                   experiences in this lesson.



                          I truly agree with learning through experience at this moment as I experienced
                   participating in different situations in the classroom. I knew sticking to routines is

                   important if we want to run a good classroom. We need to manage routines to make a
                   better classroom and let students behave as they should. During class time and other
                   activities, the teacher must ensures that all students are learning. That was my RT and

                   I did in the online classroom. Even in online classes, my resource teacher still practiced
                   the instructional routines. She was the one who maintained and kept the student feeling

                   more confident and at ease because they knew what to expect in different
                   situations. Aside from participating in every task of a teacher I was also observing
                   everything and learn from it. I cannot deny that some of time I am not able to participate

                   because of the online situation. There are times that there are task that not available to
                   experience that is why my CT look for alternative task that we need to do to learn. I

                   appreciate how she make a way how to handle everything. She not teach me how to be
                   a teacher but also she inspire me to do everything with love and patience.


                          All of the things, taught me a lesson and it prepares me for my future journey.

                   Next time, I am not just participating but also implementing the things that a teacher
                   should. I am glad to have this lesson, I will treasure all the learning and experiences

                   that I gained to be a better teacher someday. As future educators that enroll in this
                   course, our responsibility is to study well and be a responsible students. Know the dos
                   and don'ts of the school and have that motivation to start and finish this course with

                   willingness. Because there is a saying that "Sayang ang GALING kung hindi WILLING".
                   It hits me so hard that I need to do everything with willingness since I don't want to

                   waste what I have. If they see it to you they can also make it . I am not that best but I
                   know that there is someone look at you as the best even if you did not see it to yourself.
                   So make every thing happens by taking action about it. Live our life to the fullest and

                   finest, make memories, make experience and make impossible a possible in this world.

                                   Reexamining your Participating and Assisting Task

                  1.      What difficulties confronted you while you were assisting your Resource
                   Teacher (RT) in:

                   a. the preparation of instructional materials
                          In my case, I don’t feel any difficulties in preparing instructional materials while

                   assisting my Resource Teacher, Maam Alieen. In fact, it was done smoothly because
                   of the excellent connection between us. My Resource Teacher gave us a task 3 days

                   or more before the class, so we had time to prepare instructional materials like
                   PowerPoint presentations for the students. It takes time to do the IMs of the topic
                   because Maam Aileen wants to have animation and transitions for the PPT. Numbers,

                   letters, and symbols need to be manually input into the presentation, especially since
                   we have mathematics as our subject. It seems challenging, but I accept it
                   wholeheartedly and do it the best that I can. Gladly, I have the prepared PPT Template

                   from my previous works, so it saves me time and effort to work with it. I also have a
                   partner that provides a typed text from the picture sent by our RT so I can copy and
                   paste it to the PPT. It was nice to have a light environment in this kind of situation. That

                   is precisely the reason why I love working with our assigned instructional materials. It
                   makes my creativity work for the IMs of the students. Math subject will not be that

                   boring subject because of the creative IMs.

                   b. correcting student’s portfolio, projects, and other learning outputs

                          This time, I experienced difficulties while I was assisting my Cooperating
                   Teacher in correcting students' portfolios, projects, and other learning outputs. Kyle and
                   I both checked the quizzes of the students in 2 different sections. I handled the section

                   Genesis while Kyle dealt with the quizzes of section Exodus. At first, we were able to
                   check the quizzes the way that our RT wanted to. She gave us instructions on checking
                   the examinations by giving each item the answer key and the score points. Again, it is a

                   smooth and pleasant transaction with our RT, Maam Aileen. But, we suddenly
                   experienced difficulty when our midterm exam and the final exam of the students from
                   Dei Gratia School INC happened simultaneously. It's a conflicting schedule at that time

                   because we are in our midterm exam for our two major subjects. We did a checking of
                   papers right after the exam and gladly our RT, Maam Aileen, is very understanding and

                   always wants us in our best so she considered us.

                       class record
                          Nowadays, double-checking academic outputs and student performance are
                   done online in the class record. Our RT used an online learning platform that helped

                   her assess students learning. Some performance tasks and quizzes are done online
                   and automatically provide a record of the student's performance. Maam Aileen, our RT,

                   informed us every time they had it. I didn't feel any difficulties while I was assisting my
                   Resource Teacher. We have the GC that helps us to connect and communicate with
                   each other. We double-checked the record of the students by viewing and knowing who

                   missed and accomplished the task. We also follow up on our RT to check if the
                   students are still working on it or not. This way, we can track and double-check their
                   quizzes. It ensure that everything are included and no other things that can cause a

                   problem. In this way, a proper and legit performance of the student will be computed for
                   their grades.


                   d. maintaining wholesome, comfortable, and safe environment?
                          Every time we have a class, we assist and support our RT in maintaining a
                   clean, comfortable, and secure environment in the classroom. We joined the group

                   through the link that our RT provided to us on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays
                   every week. We decided to attend the Google meet so that we could find out what was
                   going on and assist our RT. Because the students were behaving in the way that we

                   had hoped they would, it was not difficult for me to assist our RT in maintaining order in
                   the classroom at this time either. There was a prayer said at the beginning of class, and
                   it is expected that everyone will follow the rules. Despite the fact that mathematics is

                   being discussed, both of these segments have a very laid-back vibe to them. Everyone
                   in the class was made to feel comfortable and at home. In this lesson, everyone's

                   objective is the same: to learn new things while also having a good time. It is better to
                   have a good vibes classroom to help student feel light. It is like a friendly home for
                   them. There is peace and harmony inside the classroom and that can be the reason for

                   them to be motivated in learning.



               2. What were the common problems have you encountered from your participation task of
                   maintaining order during instruction and co-curricular activities?

                          The common problems I encountered from my participation task of maintaining

                   order during instruction and co-curricular activities are all caused by online learning
                   systems like internet connection, noise distraction, and the time provided. In the
                   internet connection, sometimes we experienced the loss of connection while

                   conducting our class, so the interaction between our RT and the students missed out.

                   is also distracted because of it. On the other hand, voice or noise distraction in the

                   online class is one reason why students cannot understand the discussion clearly.
                   Another one is the time or the schedule of the class. Sometimes, I cannot attend the
                   class because of unexpected times or schedule conflicts. Those are some intractable

                   problems we experienced in classroom discussions and co-curricular activities.We can
                   resolve those problem if you know the reason of the situation. We can make a way how

                   to find ways about it.



               3. What were the common classroom problems/issues/concerns did you observed during
                   your participation and teaching assistantship? What action plan could you suggest to
                   overcome them?

                                                     the action that I suggest in this problem to
                                                     overcome is to understand that internet
                                                     connection    is   unstable.   If   someone

                                                             Since, we are in the online learning

                   2. Less Classroom Interaction     the students from the discussion. So, we can
                                                     only overcome it by searching for effective,
                                                     fun and interactive way to hook the attention
                                                     of the students to participate in the class
                                                     discussion.




                                                            This is one reason why students
                                                     cannot understand the discussion clearly. To
                                                     overcome this problem, look for a more quite

                          It gives me the chance to write action-based research that solves the problem


                   we saw in our observation. It wasn't easy to work on because it took a long time and a

                   lot of hard work. You need to watch the students, gather information, and think of

                   different ways to help them learn and make the classroom and school a better place.

                   Students do action research to find out why, when, and how children learn better. It

                   needs to figure out what the problem is and how to fix it. In the school we work with,

                   Dei Gratia School Inc., show me that there is a problem with how the students are

                   participating in math class. Not all of the students are actively taking part in the


                   discussion. This is because of things like how they feel, what is going on in the

                   classroom, and what is going on at home. We can't figure it out right away. To show

                   that there is a problem, you need to do research and have a reason for it. On the other

                   hand, action research has a very important use because it gives a solution that can be

                   put into action. That should be all a teacher needs to know before starting to write an


                   action research paper.

        Duration:                    The study will be conducted during the school year 2022-2023.

                                     In today's world, nobody can live without knowledge of mathematics for a
                              single day. Mathematics is intimately involved in every movement of every man's life.
                              But, most of the students hate this subject even though they know its importance and
                              because of this, it also affects their engagement during mathematics class.
                              Participation in mathematics class is something that has been studied for a long
                              time. Before Distance Education, participation was first measured by how often
                              student came to class (attendance). Then, different ways to pay attention in class,
                              like raising hands, response cards, and actively engage in the activities, were looked
                              at.

                                    Students can easily understand the lesson when engaged during the learning
                              experience (Wittrock, 1990). According to George Kuh, 2009 when students are
        Rationale:            more focused and participate, they more understand what they are learning.
                              Participation encourages students to develop their own skills, demonstrate their
                              perception of the curriculum, build confidence and apply theory (Susak, 2016).

                                      Moreover, teachers need a better understanding of the factors that hinder
                              classroom participation to help them develop more effective strategies and tackle the
                              things that keep students participating. Besides, it seems essential to learn more
                              about these factors in mathematics to think about how teaching techniques or tasks
                              are used in learning mathematics. Because classroom participation has a significant
                              impact on critical thinking development of the students. Therefore the researchers
                              want to find out what those factors are and is there is a relationship if the students
                              are demographic profile in their factors affecting classroom participation.
                                     This study aims to accomplish the following objectives;

                              the study. This collection of selected studies discusses and examines the factors
                              affecting students' participation in the mathematics classroom in terms of individual
                              elements, contextual/classroom-oriented factors, and home environment factors
                              during flexible learning. These previous works of literature are from both foreign and
                              local sources.

                                     INDIVIDUAL FACTORS
                                   Students' Attitude towards Mathematics. According to Manoah (2011), one
                              of the most influential factors in participation and success in mathematics is one's
                              attitude toward mathematics. In their study titled "Influence of attitude on student
                              performance in the mathematics curriculum," the independent variable (perspective)
                              for both girls and boys had a significant correlation with the dependent variable
                              (student performance) (Mathematics Test.).
                                   Ayob and Yasin (2017) described attitudes toward mathematics as emotional
                              reactions that might be favorable or negative depending on the circumstances.
                              According to Khoo and Ainley (2005), students' attitudes evolve throughout time and
                              significantly impact their mathematics performance. Attitudes are not fixed but rather
                              the outcome of pupils' experiences, which may be altered. These, however, are more
                              stable than people's moods and emotions. These are flexible factors of success
                              since they are reactions to educational inputs. According to Moenikia and Zahed
                              Babelan (2010), students' attitudes about mathematics influence how well they
                              succeed in the subject and how often they participate in it. It may also be shown in
        Review of             the degree to which they love doing duties connected to the topic. Thus, favorable
        Literature:           attitudes toward mathematics are required since these attitudes may impact
                              students' motivation to study the subject and the benefits that it will bring to math
                              education (Atanasova-Pacemska et al., 2015). Similarly, a bad attitude toward
                              mathematics would result in a negative emotional disposition toward the subject's
                              study, which might inhibit learning (Mata et al., 2012)
                                   Rowan-Kenyon et al. (2012) state that students are more likely to become
                              interested in a subject if they feel competent or have a high sense of self-efficacy. On
                              the other hand, they are more likely to dislike a subject if they think they will fail.
                              According to Stodolsky et al.(1991), in a study with 60 fifth-graders, they found that
                              math was one of the most complex subjects and said they could not learn math
                              independently and needed help from a teacher or parent. However, the researchers
                              say that a student's attitude toward math is a good indicator of how well they do in
                              the subject, with a positive attitude leading to better results just like in their
                              participation (Akin & Kurbanoglu, 2011; Tapia, 1996; Thorndike-Christ, 1991; Wilkins
                              & Ma, 2003)

                                   Low Self-Esteem In Participating In Mathematics Class. Students struggle
                              with confidence, which directly impacts their participation (Weaver & Qi, 2005).
                              Students are intimidated by their fears that they are not intelligent enough to speak in
                              front of their class, and as a result, they refrain from providing subject-matter insight
                              (Karp & Yoels, 1976). Independent of classroom logistics, anxiety and nervousness
                              prevent students from communicating rather than bolstering their self-assurance
                              through participation. It has been linked to classroom apprehension, which Neer
                              (1987) defines as the "avoidance of participation prompted by evaluation anxiety or

                              observed that students would only participate in class if they believed what they had
                              to say was significant and engaging. Neer and Kircher (1989) added that students
                              with classroom anxiety felt more at ease when they became acquainted with their
                              classmates and consequently felt more at ease expressing themselves. The authors
                              explained that anxiety in the classroom is alleviated by allowing students to prepare
                              for class discussions beforehand. By doing so, they become more familiar with the
                              topic and can organize their thoughts to participate in classroom discussions. Lack
                              Of Prior Knowledge About The Topic. According to Batchelor (2004), a significant
                              difficulty that instructors in higher education encounter are that students lack critical
                              prior knowledge and skills when they attend more advanced courses in their
                              curriculum. In a previous study, Hailikari, Nevgi, and Lindblom-Ylänne (2007)
                              discovered that lack of prior knowledge did not contribute to student progress. On the
                              other hand, students who started the course with a higher level of prior procedural
                              knowledge and a more integrated set of prior knowledge were more likely to do well.
                              These results show how important it is to consider what students already know at the
                              start of the learning process. So, the focus should be on what students know and
                              how well they know it (Biggs, 2003).

                                   Fear of Negative Evaluation. Fear is a problem for many students, who may
                              lack sufficient knowledge and struggle with insecurities in the classroom (Weaver,
                              2005). According to a study, some students reported not participating in class if they
                              had not prepared on the topic before class and therefore did not feel comfortable
                              engaging in discussion (Howard, 2002). Students feared that their classmates and
                              teachers would criticize them for their lack of subject knowledge. Students who
                              prepare for class tend to be more confident and, as a result, are more likely to
                              participate in class discussions (Reinsch & Wambsgnass, 1994)


                                   Gender Preference. Since Hall and Sandler (1982) claim that the college
                              classroom is a "cold climate" for female students, much research has been done on
                              the issue of student gender, with mixed results. Several studies found that the
                              gender of a student did not matter (Boersma, Gay, Jones, Morrison, & Remick, 1981;
                              Cornelius, Gray, & Constantinople, 1990; Crawford & MacLeod, 1990; Hamlin &
                              Janssen, 1981). Other studies, however, have found that males participate more
                              than females. These studies (Brooks, 1982; Constantinople, Cornelius, and Gray,
                              1988; Crawford, MacLeod, and Fassinger, 1995) found a link between the number of
                              male participants and the gender of the instructor, which suggests that more males
                              than females sign up for classes taught by women. Sternglanz and Lyberger-Ficek
                              (1977) and Pearson and West (1991) came to the opposite conclusion: male
                              students are more likely to take over the conversation in male-taught classes. Auster
                              and MacRone found in 1994 that the gender of the teacher did not affect how much
                              the students participated. Fassinger (1995) found that male students didn't care
                              about the gender of their instructors, but female students were more likely to show
                              up to classes taught by women.
                                   Upadhyay (2010) said that women are very far behind men in terms of
                              educational development. There are many reasons why girls aren't as smart as boys,
                              and one of them is social factors. It could explain why girls are better at math than
                              boys. But there are still gender differences in preparatory courses that are thought to
                              be essential for building a solid foundation for studying more advanced math in the
                              future.
                                   Thakuri's (2013) research into the "Effect of Gender in Learning Mathematics"
                              concluded that girls are treated differently than boys. When boys perform well, they
                              applaud their skill, but ladies are commended for their hard work. Boys also pay
                              more attention to their teachers than girls. As a result, the slight variation in

                                   Study Habits in Mathematics. In general, one's study habits can be broken
                              down into two categories: excellent and evil. Good study habits are productive ones
                              that help in improving the academic performance of the students or produce positive
                              results. In other words, good study habits are the ones that produce positive results
                              (Bloom, 1984; Ogbodo, 2010). After cultivating and implementing them throughout
                              their academic careers, students will find more success in school if they make these
                              study habits a part of their routine.

                                   CONTEXTUAL/CLASSROOM-ORIENTED FACTORS


                                   Topic Selection. Stern, Beck, and Woolf (1996) explain that the learner's
                              acquisition factor has an effect on the rate at which new topics are introduced into
                              the curriculum. The higher this rating, the more quickly new subject matter is
                              presented. In addition, when a student solves a problem correctly, his or her level of
                              expertise in the pertinent subjects improves at a rate that is determined by the
                              student's acquisition factor.

                                   Internet Access. Kuh and Hu (2001) state that there is a strong link between
                              using the Internet and an overall measure of how students participate in class. They
                              found a strong positive relationship between using the Internet for educational
                              practices like active and collaborative learning and student-faculty interaction. When
                              students used the Internet, they had more chances to get involved in other ways.
                              Similar to the study of Matthews and Schrum (2003) at a large public university in the
                              southeast the United States, there was a strong relationship between how well
                              students did in school and how much they thought the Internet could help them in
                              school. Cheng and Huang (2005) did a survey at a major university and found that
                              using the Internet has a significant effect on how students learn and how likely they
                              participate in the class.

                                   Availability of Technological Resources. Taking an online course presents
                              unique challenges in remote areas, and many students without smartphones or
                              internet access are left behind (Hossain, 2020). To address this demand, some
                              students have created computer-sharing home study groups. In addition, instructors
                              in the same village give their phone numbers to pupils, and students visit their homes
                              to seek assistance from their teachers (Hossain, 2020).
                                   Moreover, Palmiter (1991) and Judson (1990) discovered that using
                              technological resources in the classroom resulted in significant gains in certain
                              areas, such as increased motivation, knowledge, and student participation.


                                   Peer-student and teacher-student relationship in the online classroom. In
                              the classroom, friends are another thing that affects how much a student
                              participates. Students also said that their peers encourage their friends to take part
                              and accept each other's mistakes instead of making fun of them or laughing at them
                              (Abdullah, Bakar, & Mahbob, 2012). Students would be more willing to participate if
                              they didn't think their teachers and friends would laugh at them.

                                   Learning modalities used in flexible learning. According to one study,
                              students in flexible online learning may be lacking in opportunities to interact, receive
                              feedback on their performance, and gain social support (Tuckman, 2007). In
                              contrast, another study discovered that internet-based settings could create a sense
                              of isolation for students, making it easier for them to attend or not attend classes on




                                                            56]]></page><page Index="71"><![CDATA[a regular basis (Cull, 2010; Rost, 2019). These ideas demonstrated that students in
                              online learning experience anxiety, which leads to a lack of involvement or
                              participation. Students are easily distracted by cell phones, dogs, deliveries, and
                              other activities other than the ongoing online class because there is no interaction
                              during online lessons (Amadora, 2020). She went on to say that in the absence of
                              face-to-face interaction, it is assumed that students will be uninterested in the online
                              course.

                                   HOME ENVIRONMENT FACTORS

                                   Study Hour Of The Children At Home. According to Baliyan and Khama
                              (2020), a study found that studying after school greatly affected how well students
                              did in math. Still, nothing like that was in how well students did in English. Also,
                              students' math skills were affected by how much time they spent studying after
                              school. This was especially true if they spent more time studying than the average.

                                   Economic Condition. Drummond and Stipek (2004) say that parents with low
                              incomes are more likely to help their kids with reading than math because math is
                              not as crucial to everyday life. They are not sure of how good they are at math.
                              Changes in how math is taught may also add to this feeling of not being able to do it
                              (Sheldon & Epstein, 2005).

                                   Parental Background. The intelligence of students in mathematics, among
                              other subjects, is affected by a variety of factors. It is obvious that the availability of
                              these factors is heavily dependent on parents' background, as well as their love for
                              their children and interest in the subject – mathematics (Hilgard, Richard, Alkinson, &
                              Rita, 1933). How well students do in math is based on their parents' educational
                              background (Anderson & May 1991; Kimbir, Musa, & Bassey, 2006; and Velasco-
                              Hernandez, & Hsieh, 1994). So, what's new about this study is that it looks at
                              students' inherited and learned intelligence in relation to their parents' backgrounds.

                                   Parents' Involvement And Attitude Towards Mathematics. Cerid (1990),
                              discovered that their parents' attitudes toward education influence children's
                              educational participation and persistence. How much a child stays in school depends
                              on how his or her parents feel about it. When parents realize how important it is for
                              their kids to go to school, this is a chance for the kids to learn. Most parents know
                              how important it is to be involved in their children's education and how important it is
                              to learn (Drummond & Stipek, 2004; Kliman, 2006). However, it is common for
                              parents to have trouble teaching their kids math and helping them understand it.
                              Many parents feel like they cannot help their kids with math because they do not feel
                              confident in their math skills, do not know enough about the subject, or do not have
                              the teaching skills they need to help their kids (Drummond & Stipek, 2004; Kliman,
                              2006; Lopez & Donovan, 2009; Pohan & Adams, 2007; Sheldon & Epstein, 2005).

                                   Family support. According to Nurkholis (2013), family support plays an
                              essential role in student achievement because the support and attention of this
                              family determine students' success in achieving high learning achievement.
                              Friedman defined family support as each family member's attitude, action, and
                              acceptance. Every student/individual requires family support, which can take the
                              form of love, advice, and attention. Family support can help students improve their
                              learning achievement because, during the distance learning process, families
                              become teachers as well as supervisors for their children. The type of family support
                              expected during distance learning is to devote more time and attention to children to
                              accompany and guide them through the learning process. Furthermore, the family

                              learning materials. Families can also be used to voice concerns about difficulties
                              encountered during the distance learning process.




                                     a. Locale of the Study

                                       The study will be conducted in Tanza National Trade School - ANNEX
                                 located at Bagtas, Tanza, Cavite during the academic year 2022-2023.

                                     b. Research Design

                                       In this study, the researchers will utilize a Quantitative method of research. It
                                 will choose to satisfy the need to analyze, interpret, and collect the data needed in
                                 this research. Quantitative research generates numerical data that can transform into
                                 usable statistics. It quantifies attitudes, opinions, behaviors, and other defined
                                 variables (DeFranzo, 2020). It will be the method used to learn about a particular
                                 group of people or what we know as a sample. Quantitative research relies on the
                                 data gathered, observed and measured by researchers of different fields and studies.
                                       The researchers will use quantitative research to describe the respondents'
                                 demographic profiles and correlate the different factors affecting classroom
                                 participation to the respondent's demographic profiles. To fully comprehend the study,
                                 a research design will be used to analyze the given data. As a result, the descriptive
                                 correlational research design will be the best fit for this study.
                                       According to Sousa et al. (2007), Descriptive correlational studies describe the
                                 variables and the natural relationships between and among them. Correlational
                                 designs, as opposed to direct cause-effect relationships, involve systematically
                                 investigating the nature of relationships or associations between and among
                                 variables. Correlations investigate the direction, magnitude, and strength of
        Detailed                 relationships or associations. Descriptive, predictive, and model testing correlational
        Methodology:             designs are three of the most common correlational designs. Hence, at the end of this
                                 research, the researchers wIll be able to find out the relationship of the demographic
                                 profile of the respondents to the factors affecting student participation.

                                     c. Sampling Procedure

                                       This study will look for 150 possible respondents in Grade 10 students in
                                 Tanza National Trade School - ANNEX. Stratified purposive sampling will be
                                 employed in this study. It is best suit for this type of research because the
                                 researchers will give an equal opportunity to the respondents. According to Patton
                                 (2001), he describes these at samples within samples and suggests that purposeful
                                 samples can be stratified or nested by selecting particular units or cases that vary
                                 according to a key dimension. The researchers will also use fish bowl technique in
                                 selecting the respondents from the complete list of the students from grade 10. Then,
                                 the respondents who will be selected will receive a personal message from the
                                 researchers.

                                       This research will gather the information needed for the study from 150
                                 respondents that will select randomly from the population. The research data will
                                 collect via an online survey questionnaire rather than a face-to-face survey due to the
                                 danger of Covid 19.
                                       The researcher will ensure to distribute the communication letter that the
                                 respondents need to acknowledge before proceeding with the study any further.
                                 Aside from it, the informed consent form and the confidentiality form will also include
                                 in the survey or google form that the respondents will receive to ensure the
                                 agreement made between the researchers and the respondent.
                                       The researchers will use google form as the research instrument to gather
                                 data among the students. The link will be distributed to 150 randomly selected Grade
                                 10 students at Tanza National Trade School - ANNEX, located at Bagtas, Tanza
                                 Cavite. The link to the survey questionnaire will administer via Facebook Messenger.
                                 These questions are in a Likert scale form.
                                       During the survey, direct observation was impossible due to the situation
                                 which is why the researchers will actively wait for the respondent's queries and
                                 confirmation. After the researcher meets the expected number of data, the
                                 respondents' responses will be reviewed, interpreted, and analyzed using the

                          Teaching will always be an honorable calling for me. It is not my dream, but I

                   believe it can fulfill my goal in life to make a difference and touch one's life. That is

                   precisely the reason why I'm still here in the program. As pre-service teachers, I can


                   say that our journey will be worth it if I take a Field Study subject to experience

                   observing, assisting, and participating in classroom settings that help us prepare for

                   being a teacher. In this essay I will share my reflection upon taking this lesson.

                          This subject also allows us to write action-based research that addresses our

                   noticed problem in our observation. It was not that easy working it because it was a

                   long process and needed a lot of effort. You need to observe the students, collect data

                   and think about different activities to improve student learning and the classroom and


                   school environment. Action research drives students to understand why, when, and

                   how children become better learners. It needs to find a certain problem and find a

                   solution out of it. In out cooperating school Dei Gratia School Inc, show me that there is

                   a problem about the participation of the students when it comes to mathematics subject.

                   Not all of the students are actively participating in the discussion because of different


                   issues like their individual factors, contextual/classroom-oriented factors and home

                   environment factors. We cannot identify it in just a snap. It needs a research and basis

                   to prove that there is a problem. On the other hand there is a very important used of

                   this action research because it provides a solution that can provide action to solve it.

                   That must all the teacher need to know from the very start of creating action research

                   paper.

                          In this lesson, I realized that as a pre-service teacher, I should practice taking


                   action on the things that can help our students improve. Since I am in the moment of

                   becoming a teacher and I had my teaching assistantship, I should know specific

                   problems to work on, specifically in this New Normal way of teaching-learning. So, my

                   action research is one of the starting points for searching for a trial and providing a

                   solution to it. It is a way of helping our student, co-teachers, school and faculty .

                          Is writing a classroom-based action research proposal will help you as a
                   strategic teacher in the future. Cite relevant and related literature to justify.


                          People say that many teachers in the classroom are too busy to read research


                   studies, let alone do their own. Many people in the field see research as a complicated

                   set of steps that are too hard and time-consuming for classroom teachers to take part

                   in or lead. Teachers who spend most of their time in their own classrooms may not see

                   the point of research. This is because there isn't much research written by practicing

                   teachers, and most of the time it doesn't have anything to do with what happens in

                   classrooms every day (Ferrance, 2000; McBee, 2004). But research is done in a lot of

                   educational settings, and it often has a good effect. According to McBee (2004),


                   "classrooms that become laboratories are better classrooms" (p.157). This is because,

                   as Johnson (2005) explains, research is not effective if teachers see it as an order from

                   researchers to practicing educators. It is much more effective when it is built with

                   personal relevance.

                          Writing a classroom-based action research proposal will help me as a strategic


                   teacher in the future. Action research is an effective professional process that has an

                   impact on current and/or future teaching, and it elicits change. For starters, participating

                   in action research has an impact on teachers' current and future instructional practices.

                   The benefit of action research, according to Parsons and Brown (2002), is that it leads

                   to improvements in educational practice. It is clear that the participants in this study

                   regarded action research as a valuable tool that influenced their teaching. Teachers

                   consistently stated that the action research process made them more aware of their


                   teaching practices and more sensitive to the needs of their students. It is a way for

                   improving and enhancing a certain things for the welfare of school, teachers, students,

                   faculty and sometimes the parents of the students. This is make the a problem an

                   awareness that hinders the learning of the students. So, as a future teacher , I must

                   learn to Identify problems and also provide solution about that problem.
