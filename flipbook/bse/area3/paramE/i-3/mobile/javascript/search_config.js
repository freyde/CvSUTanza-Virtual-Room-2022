Education is by far one of the largest vulnerable sectors, in all levels of                        public  and  private  schools,  colleges  and  universities  mainly  because  of  the                        greater  number  of  vulnerable  groups  of  students  and  teachers.  Amidst  the                        challenges and threats of the pandemic, education leaders and policy makers                        have crystalized the dilemma through coming up with alternative strategies to                        resist  this  current  disruption.  In  the  Philippine  higher  education,  the  shift  to                        flexible  learning  in  the  new  normal  has  opened  opportunities  in  the  greater                        number  of  public  higher  education  institutions  while  private  education                        institutions  have  continuously  maintained  the  use  of  online  learning  and                        distance learning.                               Nonetheless, higher education institutions are still caught in a dilemma                        affecting the internship program which constitutes a major requirement for any                        curricular program because of the limitations on physical contacts and face to                        face  instruction.  For  one,  teacher  education  institutions  are  transitioning                        through  a  particularly  uncertain  time  in  responding  and  preparing  for  an                        alternative strategy in its internship program. The present situation should not                        limit the colleges and universities to train future teachers because it is the most                        effective way for them to experience and be immersed in the teaching world.                        Hence, there is a need for the universities, cooperating schools and cooperating                        teachers  to  work  hand  in  hand  to  provide  an  exceptional  preparation  and                        opportunity for pre-service teachers.                               From a legal perspective, the Commission on Higher Education (CHED)                        through  the  Technical  Working  Group  has  conducted  an  on-line  Public                        Hearing/Consultation on the proposed New Normal Policies and Guidelines on                        the  Deployment  of  Pre-service  Teachers  for  Field  Study  and  Teaching                        Internship held last September 08, 2020.  Relative to this Draft Policies and","2                          Guidelines  on  the  Deployment  of  Pre-Service  Teachers  for  Field  Study  and                        Teaching  Internship  for  AY  2020-2021,  current  preparations  are  being                        undertaken to deliver courses by means of flexible modalities.  The Field Study                        and Practice Teaching courses also need to be redesigned in ways that are                        compatible  with  the  present  situation.  This  draft  guidelines  and  policies  has                        raised a fundamental argument on the need to shift from residential or face to                        face  teaching  to  flexible  learning  in  higher  education  and  learning  delivery                        modalities in basic education to ensure the health, safety and security of the                        teachers,  students,  pre-  service  teachers  and  other  stakeholders  during  the                        time of the pandemic.                               In  consideration  thereof,  Cavite  State  University  through  the  Teacher                        Education  Department  of  the  College  of  Education  has  proposed  an  Online                        Student Teaching Internship Program that conforms to the set of guidelines                        stipulated  in  the  Draft  Policies  and  Guidelines  on  the  Deployment  of  Pre-                        Service Teachers for Field Study and Teaching Internship for AY 2020-2021.                        The implementation of this  Online Student Teaching Internship Program will                        take into consideration the necessary modifications in the delivery of Teaching                        Internship given the context and available resources of the Teacher Education                        Programs  in  the  CvSU  System.  Essentially,  this  Online  Student  Teaching                        Internship Program will adopt the experiential  learning, new normal learning                        modalities,  developmental  approach  through  coaching  and  mentoring,  and                        aligned  with  the  DepEd  Learning  Continuity  Plan  (LCP)  and  Most  Essential                        Learning Competencies (MELCs).

Reyes and Mrs. Margie P. Reyes. I am currently residing at Block 7, Lot 10, Section                         19, Phase 2, Bahay Katuparan, Bagtas, Tanza, Cavite.                                From 2005 until 2008, I studied my first to fourth grade at Dr. Jose P. Rizal                         Elementary School in Dasmarinas Cavite. In 2009, I transferred to Leyte and finished                          my remaining primary education in 2010. In that same year, I moved back to Cavite.                         From 2010 to 2014, I spent my secondary education and graduated with honor at                         Tanza National Trade School—ANNEX, located in Bagtas, Tanza, Cavite.                                In  that  same  year,  I  took  a  two-year  computer  programming  course  at                         Datacom Institute of Computer Technology in Rosario Cavite and graduated in 2016.                                 In 2017, I landed my first job as Team Leader in Silang, Cavite, and filed my                         resignation in August 2018. In that same year, I took up a Bachelor of Secondary                         Education major in Mathematics at Cavite State University Tanza Campus.                                I am hoping to obtain a degree in 2022.                                                                                                      iii","LETTER TO THE READERS                            Dear Readers,                                I was a volunteer children's teacher in our church back then but it’s not really                         my dream to be a teacher by profession. The teaching program was not also my first                         choice when I decided to pursue study again. But who would have imagined that this                         might be my calling? None, because even myself, I don’t envision myself becoming a                         teacher.  But,  as  I  entered  the  crucial  part  of  the  education  program,  Student-                          Teaching  Internship  Program,  and  as  I  reflected  and  realized  that  all  things  work                         together for my good and everything has a purpose, I suddenly fell in love with the                         teacher-education program.                                 Being  a  student-teacher  in  the  new  normal  education  system  was  a  huge                         challenge but it has been a great teaching experience and learning process for me                          throughout my sixty-five days of being one at St. Jude Parish School, Inc.                                 If  you  happened  to  read  this  portfolio,  welcome  to  my  sixty-two  days  of                         student teaching internship! It is with great honor to share with you my experience                         and summary of my entire student teaching experience at the said school.                                With this portfolio, you will be able to read my sixty-two day daily journal, my                         expectations for the program, reflections and overall all appraisal, and other photo                         documentations.                                 While turning each page, let each words be your guide to experience what I                         had experience. And as you use this portfolio, I hope that your understanding grows                         in terms of teaching and may also bring you an idea that you could use when you                         become a student-teacher.

Student teaching program is where I will put into                     practice all that I have learned from first to third year. But I know those learning will never                     be enough as teaching itself is a lifelong learning process. I knew that along the way I                     will learn new and different things, and I am looking forward for it.                            Prior to the pandemic, my expectations for the student teaching program were                      typical  such  as;  I'll  go  to  my  cooperating  school  and  teach,  create  lesson  plans  and                     develop instructional materials, make and check quizzes and exercises, and, of course,                     engage with students and teachers. Before becoming a student-teacher, I imagined the                     things I wanted to implement and apply. I've also decided where I'll practice, what I'd like                     my students to call me, and other such details. But indeed, life brought inevitable change                      and surprises; the pandemic happened. Traditional education has shifted to blended and                     online distance learning. I have experience being a student in the new-normal education                     for almost two years and I could say that it is different in a way that, being in front of                     computer or even phone can tire you, and especially the activities. These and more are                     what I have encountered being a student in the new normal. With these, I realized that if                     the  online  class  is  hard  and  difficult  in  the  part  of  student,  how  much  more  to  the                     teachers? With that thought, the nervousness and excitement comes.                             In the online student-teaching internship program, I expect that the teaching skills                     that  I  will  learn  in  online  classes  will  not  compromise  what  I  should  learn  in  the  four-                     corner classroom, but rather will equip and prepare me to educate students in the 21st                     century.  I  also  expect  that  my  cooperating  school  had  prepared  enough  to  the  new                     education system. I expect that they’re using the best learning management system for                      both  of  their  teachers  and  students.  I  also  expect  that  my  cooperating  teacher  is                     knowledgeable enough with regards to using different online teaching platforms and of                                                                   1","course,  had  the  mastery  to  his/her  subject  matter.  I  also  expect  that  my  cooperating                     teacher will be kind and considerate with me. With students, I expect that they will be                     kind and considerate with me, that they will always attend every synchronous class and                     submit their activities on time. These and more are my expectations to my cooperating                      school, cooperating teacher and future students.                            With these expectations that I have mentioned, I knew that there’s a possibility                     that it will not happen but also, there will be chance of it to happen. With this uncertainty,                     I should be prepared at everything. Prepare for whatever will happen. As the quote says                     “expect the worst; hope for the best”.                                                                                                                           2","REFLECTION ON CLASSROOM OBSERVATION                               A classroom observation is an act of watching a teacher’s performance in their                     classroom  or  learning  environment.    It  can  be  a  formal  or  informal  observation  of                     teaching while it is taking place in a classroom or other learning environment. There are                     two  (2)  basic  types  of  observations:  First,  when  a  school  administrator  watches  a                     teacher’s performance as a part of a formal job performance evaluation at a regularly                     scheduled interval (often annually); second, is an observation performed by a teacher’s                      peer  or  peers,  instructional  specialist,  or  coach  with  the  stated  goal  of  providing  the                     teacher  with  relevant  feedback  based  on  their  interactions  with  students  and  their                     execution  of teaching methods  with  the  primary  goal  of  making  improvements  in  their                     classroom management and instructional techniques.  This section summarizes my five-                     day  observation  on  classroom  management,  instructional  strategies,  classroom                      environment,  lesson  plan,  assessment  of  lessons,  students  and  cooperating  school                     before I formally start my student-teacher journey.                            Cooperating School. St. Jude Parish School, Inc. is a well-known private school                     located in Trece Martires City, Cavite. They were very accommodative and allowed us to                     conduct our student teaching internship at their school. Mr. Eric Bocalan, the principal,                     was also kind when we met him at his office, as were some of the teachers that were                     there.  They  also  have  kind  personnel,  like  the  security  guard.  They  also  have  clean                      school facilities, like the comfort room, and a clean school environment. If we were not in                     the middle of a pandemic, I could see myself teaching as a student-teacher.                            Classroom  Environment.  Since  we  are  in  the  new  normal  education,  the                     traditional  classroom  environment  turns  into  a  screen.  However,  I  could  refer  to  the                     classroom environment as the platform that they’re using. St. Jude Parish School, Inc.                      uses  two  different  learning  management  systems  to  track  their  students’  academic                     performance. The first platform is the MS Teams; they provide email addresses to their                                                                   3","students  so  they  can  join  the  organization.  Most  teachers  conduct  their  synchronous                     classes on this platform. It has messaging features, where students and teachers can                     communicate;  it  also  has  video  conferencing,  where  synchronous  discussions  and                     classes  are  conducted;  recordings,  to  record  the  discussion;  and  a  calendar,  where                      teachers  can  schedule  the  meeting  and  invite  students  to  that  schedule.  Overall,  MS                     Teams’  environment  is  impressive.    The  second  platform  is  the  Aralinks.  This  is  a                     learning management platform where teachers upload the learning materials, and create                     quizzes and exercises. This is also where students can access the modules and submit                     their activities. As for what I have observed, Aralinks is like the common LMS. It’s also                      similar  to  the  CvSU  e-LMS.  Prior  to  my  actual  teaching,  my  cooperating  teacher                     entrusted me her accounts on the two platforms, which I am grateful for because, first I                     can see if the students are submitting their activities and second, I can really experience                     being a real online teacher.  As I explored the two platforms, and I could say that St.                     Jude Parish School, Inc chose the right platforms for both their students and teachers.                            Here  are  my  observations  to  my  cooperating  teacher  on  her  classroom                     management, instructional strategies, lesson plan, assessment of lessons and students:                             Cooperating  teacher.  I  learned  a  lot  of  things  during  my  five-day  observation                     with my cooperating teacher. She is good at teaching the content and the mastery of the                     subject  matter  was  very  evident.  I,  myself  was  also  learning  while  observing.  She  is                     punctual; she opens the meeting before the scheduled time. She is soft spoken, which                     makes the students comfortable at her. She is not too fast or too slow while teaching.                      She has good internet connection and computer/laptop. However, I also noticed that:                            (1) she don’t require her students to attend the synchronous classes and she not                            prompted  her  students  to  enter  on time  or  before  the time  of  the  online  class;                            because  out  of  19  students  of  St.  Dominic  less  than  10  students  attend  the                            classes;                            (2) she don’t require them to open their camera; and                                                                   4","(3) most of the time, the synchronous class are not interactive and collaborative.                     With these, I realized that students will just join in the meeting, and they can do whatever                     they want off camera and pretend that they’re listening.                            Classroom  Management.  With  her  classroom  management,  my  cooperating                      teacher always starts and ends the discussion with a prayer. But most of the time, she                     was the one who leads the prayer. She always did the basic preliminary activities like                     greetings and recalling of previous topic. She sometimes did quick motivational activities                     like answering True or False. She does call students to determine whether the statement                     is true or false. But sometimes she’s not interacting to students. Sometimes when she’s                      recalling the previous lesson, she doesn’t call students to answer what was the previous                     topic, and so on. She’s not also checking the attendance. Most of the time, the students                     joined the meeting late, so she’s also starts the discussions late. Overall, the classroom                     management of my cooperating teacher is good but, ideally, it’s not what it’s supposed to                     be.                            Instructional  Strategies.  With  her  instructional  strategies,  the  PowerPoint                     presentation looks clean and minimalist. The slides are not overcrowded by texts. The                      choice of font style and design of the presentation is good. From day 1 to day 5, the                     presentation  design  or  theme  was  the  same.    I  found  out  that  the  presentations  are                     sometimes ready-made for the teachers; there is someone that makes it for the teachers.                     If  there  is  available  PowerPoint  presentation  for  the  certain  topic,  that’s  what  my                     cooperating teacher will used. I loved also that my cooperating teacher uses drawing pen                      and  tablet  for  her  solutions.  She’s  writing  the  solutions  and  not  depending  on  the                     PowerPoint  presentation.    With  this  strategy,  the  students  can  easily  follow  and                     understand the topic.                            Lesson Plan. With her lesson plan, I also found out that they are not required to                     make daily lesson plan and someone makes the learning materials to make the content                     synchronize  to  all  sections.  However,  they  create  weekly  learning  plan.  It’s  like  a                                                                   5","summary of topics and activities. At first, I find it difficult to understand the sequence but                     as I understand it, I found it easy and simple.                            Assessment  of  Each  Lesson.  The  learning  materials  are  always  provided  by                     the head teacher of the subject matter including the assessment or posttest. I asked my                      cooperating  teacher  if  she  change  the  assessment  provided  in  the  learning  materials,                     and  she  said  she  doesn’t.  Their  assessment  or  posttest  comprises  three  parts:                     Knowledge,  Process  and  Understanding.  I  think  that  it  measures  what  it  tends  to                     measure and assessment is aligned to the objectives.                            Students. Throughout my five-day observation to my cooperating teacher, I only                      observe one section and that Grade 10 – St. Dominic. What I’ve noticed with them are:                             (1) they’re always joined late in every synchronous class. On my first day, the                            first student who joined was ten (10) minutes late with the 8:00 am class, which                            affects the time management of my cooperating teacher. This is very consistent                            from day 1 of my observation up to day 5;                            (2) they’re not opening their cameras during the synchronous classes; It is very                            difficult to teach online and it makes even harder if you don’t see the faces and                             reactions of your students; and                            (3) whenever my cooperating teacher asks or clarify something, nobody wants to                            initiate  to  answer.  When  their  name  was  called,  some  suddenly  exit  in  the                            meeting,  some  don’t  answer  immediately,  and  some  will  message  that  their                            microphones are broken.                             (4) they can’t even say “Yes, Ma’am” or “No, Ma’am” when they are asked if they                            understand  the  lesson  or  if  they  have  questions  with  the  topic.  This  simple                            gesture is a big factor for teachers because it simply implies that the students are                            listening.                     These are the things that I noticed with Grade 10 – St. Dominic that is consistent from                     day 1 until day 5 of my observation.                                                                   6","With all that I have observed and noticed with my future students, I knew I will                     have a problem. I knew that I will also experience what I have observed because I think                     that the students get used to do those things. But I am still grateful because I have seen                     those things before I start my actual teaching. I still have time to think of strategies that                      will engage the students to the discussion. I can still think of ways how to make them join                     the  meeting  on  or  before  the  time  and  attend  all  the  discussions  that  I  will  teach.                     Moreover,  I  can  still  think  of  how  I  will  implement  my  teaching  strategies  to  the  new                     normal education with the kind of students I saw.                            To summarize, I learned a lot of things specifically in the content and mastery of                      the subject to my cooperating teacher. Although there are minor lapses, I still looked up                     to her. I also learned that it is very important to be committed on time because it mirrors                     your discipline and respect towards others. I also learned that even your only have few                     students, should teach those few and don’t cancel the discussion because it is unfair for                     those students who make time to be in the meeting.   I also learned to be patient and                     persistent.                                                                                                     7","SELF-ASSESSMENT ON READINESS IN THE ACTUAL TEACHING                               Being prepare at whatever student-teaching internship journey will throw at you is                     what  the  student  teacher  must  think  about  before  starting.  He/She  must  be  prepared                     mentally, physically, emotionally and spiritually.                            As teachers, we should know what and why we’re teaching a certain lesson. In                     my  case,  as  a  student  teacher,  I  will  solely  teach  the  required  curriculum  of  my                     cooperating school. I will make each lesson attractive and interactive to hook the interest                      and attention of my students because their ages range from 14 to 16 and they can easily                     be  distracted  and  out-of-focus  when  they  see  numbers  and  mathematics.  Since  our                     scheduled synchronous class was mostly in the morning, it is important to capture the                     students’ attention because most of them had just woken up. I will begin the lesson with                     stories and/or activities that can be individual or small group discussions that are both                      relevant  to  our  lesson  and  to  their  lives.  Also,  adding  different  resources  in  the                     presentation would have a huge impact, such as audio-visual or technology, which are                     the most commonly used in online classes. It is also important to have a quick summary                     and/or clarification about the lesson before ending the discussion or giving them a quiz                     or  assignment.  Each  lesson  will  be  assessed  through  a  summative  test,  which  they                     called a posttest. A post-test is required to be submitted and answered by the students. It                     will be graded according to the given rubrics.                             For me to know if I succeeded in teaching the lesson is through the responses of                     students  and  the  comments  of  my  cooperating  teacher.  I  am  hoping  that  through  the                     lesson  that  I  will  be  teaching,  my  students  will  develop  critical  thinking  skills,                     collaboration skills, and a deep understanding of the concept that they can be apply in                     their daily lives.                                                                        8","DAILY JOURNAL                        Day 1: 3 November 2021                            Today  is  the  last  day  of  our  cooperating  school  hunting.  I  messaged  Sir  Eric                     Bocalan  through  Facebook  Messenger  on  October  14,  2021,  but  due  to  their  hectic                     schedules, they couldn’t accommodate us. I consistently messaged Sir Eric to follow up,                     and yesterday, he asked if we could come to their school. Since we were not allowed to                     go  to  school,  I  asked  our  adviser  if  it  was  possible  for  us  to  go  to  St.  Jude.  She                      encouraged and reminded us to take care of ourselves.                            And  today  is  our  scheduled  day  to  visit  St.  Jude  and  submit  the  endorsement                     letter and memorandum of agreement. We should arrive at St. Jude by ten o'clock in the                     morning, so I woke up early to prepare myself. We arrived at the school ahead of time,                     so we waited in their waiting area. While waiting, I am quite nervous and a lot of \"what                      if’s\" come to my mind. To relieve the nervousness we have, we exchange thoughts about                     current events, etc. At exactly 10 o’clock, we approached the guard and told him that we                     needed  to  go  to  the  principal’s  office.  He  directed  us,  and  we  went  to  the  principal's                     office, where we met Sir Eric Bocalan, St. Jude's Principal. We greeted each teacher in                     the  office,  and  we  gave  the  endorsement  letter  together  with  the  memorandum  of                     agreement  to  Sir  Eric.  We  discussed  the  requirements  of  the  internship,  such  as  the                     need to do the entire internship online. He agreed on it, and on that same day, he had                      already  assigned  us  to  our  cooperating  teacher.  Fortunately,  my  cooperating  teacher                     was in school, so there I met her and gave her my Facebook account and immediately                     sent  her  a  friend  request.  The  meeting  ended,  and  we  said  goodbye  to  them.  I                     immediately gave an update to our adviser and went home.                            While on the road, I was praying because I didn’t know what would happen to me                      in this internship. I'm still nervous, but thankful that we finally have a cooperating school.                                                                     9","Day 2: 4 November 2021                            Today, nothing important happened related to my teaching internship at St. Jude.                     I just messaged Ma’am Maritess, my cooperating teacher, and introduced myself, and                     she introduced herself too. I asked her about anything that she wanted me to do, and                      she  told  me  that  there  was  nothing  yet  because  this  is  their  first  quarter  examination                     week. I asked her if I could make an advanced lesson plan or check students’ outputs.                     She said that they didn’t technically create lesson plans because they followed what was                     on the module prepared by the head teacher. And she can still handle the checking of                     students’ outputs. So I don’t insist on anything because that’s what she said. I just asked                      her if we could set a virtual meeting schedule to discuss my roles and responsibilities as                     a student teacher, and she said that maybe on November 7 at 4 o’clock in the afternoon.                     I agreed, and that’s the end of our conversation for today.                            To end this day journal, I was somehow disappointed because this is not what I                     expected  to  happen,  especially  on  our  very  first  day  as  student  teachers.  I  am                     disappointed that there is no virtual orientation with their academic coordinator or head                     teacher to discuss their rules and requirements with all their student-teachers. I did not                      expect that they didn’t have any plans for this. This is just my opinion. Let’s see what will                     happen in the latter days.                                                                                             10","Day 3: 5 November 2021                            I  figured  out  that  I  will  not  be  able  to  know  anything  about  the  online  class                     procedures  of  St.  Jude  if  I  will  not  ask  about  it.  So,  today,  I  asked  my  cooperating                     teacher  some  questions  that  piqued  my  interest,  such  as  what  learning  management                      system they use, how they conduct online classes, and so on.                            I  found  out  that  St.  Jude  Parish  School  is  using  Aralinks  as  their  learning                     management  system,  and  she  conducted  her  online  class  in  Microsoft  Teams.  My                     cooperating teacher told me to create an account on Microsoft Teams so she could add                     me to her teams or group chat with her students. I also tell my co-student teachers to                      create an account on MS Teams.                            This  will  be  my  first  time  using  the  said  platform,  so  I  asked  my  cooperating                     teacher  if  I  could  explore  first  to  familiarize  myself  before  my  actual  teaching.  Upon                     exploring MS Teams, I was totally amazed and hooked by it. For me, it's like a complete                     package for an online classroom. It has a built-in video conference where you can meet                     your students and do online teaching. It has a lot of features, but unfortunately, I couldn’t                     explore more because I had no team/(s) yet, so I watched videos on YouTube about MS                      Teams in which I learned a lot, and hopefully I will apply them.                            My  cooperating  teacher  did  not  emphasize  a  lot  about  Aralinks,  and  I  am  not                     familiar with it so I just ignored it today and will ask about it in our one-on-one orientation.                            That summarizes this day.                                                                                       11","Day 4: 7 November 2021                            Today is my one-on-one virtual orientation with my cooperating teacher, Ma’am                     Maritess Ferrer. The meeting started at 4 o’clock in the afternoon and was administered                     through MS Teams. The meeting started by introducing ourselves. Ma’am Maritess went                      first, then I followed her. I gave her my complete name, age, address, program/course                     and school. I also clarify that I am a student teacher and not just a field study student.                            After  that,  she  presented  a  word  document  with  a  list  of  what  I  needed  to  do                     within my internship days. The schedule for my synchronous classes was also included                     in the document she presented. She told me that I would only teach one section because                      she only had one junior high school subject. She also gave me her MS Teams SPJS                     Organization  Account  and  her  Aralinks  Account.  I  was  really  grateful  for  her  trust,                     knowing that these accounts were too personal for her to entrust to me. She also told me                     what she wanted me to do with the student activities and outputs. As much as possible,                     we checked the posttest and returned to the students to provide feedback immediately.                            She also told me that this coming week was their examination week, and there                     was nothing that I could do yet. I asked her about creating lesson plans and PowerPoint                      presentations, and she told me that they don’t create daily lesson plans but rather weekly                     lesson plans. And the content of the lesson was provided, which is their module. And                     that I will only put effort into making presentations because some of the modules come                     with  ready-made  PowerPoint  presentations,  but  some  don't.  She  also  asked  me  if  I                     wanted to start immediately. I told her that if I could observe her first before I could start                      my actual teaching. She agreed with me and told me that there are few students that                     attend  their  synchronous  classes  in  St.  Dominic  and  that  they  cannot  force  them  to                     attend if they don’t want to. I was a little confused and disappointed about that matter.                     But I just said that it’s okay.                            We talked about life for a while and took a screenshot or picture before we ended                     our orientation.                                                                   12","Day 5: 8 November 2021                            Today  is  SPJS  first  quarter  examination.  I  messaged  my  CT  and  greeted  her                     good morning. She told me that she was busy printing examination papers for modular                     students. I asked her about the possible topics for the second quarter, and she said that                      there are no posts about it, and she said that she would update me if she already has the                     copy. I explored  MS Teams using my CT's account. I tried doing video meetings and                     trying to present screens and other staff in MS Teams. Upon exploring the MS Teams, I                     saw  the  Recordings  folder  in  the  St.  Dominic  team  and  saw  my  CT's  recorded                     discussion. I asked her permission if I could watch her video recorded discussions, and                      she replied by the afternoon, and she granted me her permission.                            I  also  visited  and  explored  the  Aralinks  and found  that  they  are  like  the  CvSU                     eLMS. So, I went to Math 10 St. Dominic and found that there were 40 students in their                     section. I also saw some students' outputs. I noticed that out of 40 students, less than 15                     students submitted their post-test on time.                            I continued exploring the two platforms to familiarize myself with them.                        Day 6: 15 November 2021                            Today is the first day of the second quarter in SPJS. Tomorrow will be my first                     actual observation of my CT's discussion. Ma'am Maritess sent me a copy of Module 9                     as well as its PowerPoint presentation.I read and studied them. The lesson was about                     the circle and its parts. The module itself consists of lessons for the whole week, from                      day 1 to day 5, with exercises and a post-test. Ma'am Maritess told me that tomorrow                     she will only discuss Day 1 of Module 9 on one day, Day 2 on the other day, and so on.                     She  also  sent  me  the  meeting  link  for  tomorrow's  class  schedule.  After  reading  and                     studying the module sent to me, I asked my CT if there was something else that she                     needed me to do. She said there wasn't. She also said that all I needed to do for this                     week was to observe. This summarizes this day.                                                                   13","Day 7: 16 November 2021                            Today is my first observation of Ma'am Maritess's actual teaching in St. Dominic. I                     woke  up  early  because  the  class  would  start  at  8  o'clock  in  the  morning.  I  prepared                     myself, opened my computer, and logged into my Facebook account. I joined the link                      sent to me yesterday at 7:30 AM. Since I was only a guest in their meeting, I waited for                     Ma'am Maritess to admit me to the meeting.                            It's  already  eight  o'clock  and  there  are  no  students  in  the  class.  At  around                     8:10am, there were 3 students, and Ma'am Maritess told them that they would start when                     they reached at least 5 students. The class official started at around 8:15am with seven                      people  in  the  meeting:  I,  Ma'am  Maritess,  and  five  students.  Maritess  started  the                     discussion by leading the prayer and greeted the students. She welcomed the students                     to their second quarter, introduced the lesson, and started the discussion.                            I noticed that the discussion was not interactive because there was no interaction                     between  the  students.  The  students  are  passive  and  silently  listening.  When  Ma'am                     Maritess  asked  something,  nobody  wanted  to  answer.  And  it  was  time-consuming                     knowing that she only had 50 minutes to discuss, and she started late because of the                      students,  so  Ma'am  Maritess  called  the  students  to  answer,  but  it  still  didn't  work                     because they didn't respond either. Until the discussion ended, Ma'am Maritess was the                     only one who was talking and talking. The discussion ended with a prayer. The students                     left the meeting. Only Ma'am Maritess and I were left. She told me that the students in                     St.  Dominic  have  been  like  that  since  the  start  of  the  class.  Some  didn't  attend  their                      synchronous class, and most of the time, her students in St. Dominic were always less                     than 10. We ended the meeting because Ma'am Maritess had her next class.                            Upon  observing  Ma'am  Maritess  and  St.  Dominic,  I  felt  scared  and  worried                     because these were the students that I would be teaching with. They were passive and                     not interactive. I also realized that no matter how good you are or how prepared you are                                                                      14","for the class, if the students are not cooperative, it will be wasted. Because teaching and                     learning should be a two-way process, it shouldn't be done by the teacher alone.                        Day 8: 17 November 2021                             Today, my observation schedule to my cooperating teacher was from 9:50 a.m.                     to 10:40 p.m. She sent me the meeting link at around 8:00 a.m. I joined the meeting 20                     minutes before the time, so I waited again to Ma’am Maritess to admit me in the meeting.                     She admitted earlier before the time, so we briefly talk about my internship and life in                     general.                             The class started 10 minutes late because, the students joined late. The class                     started with the prayer and proceeded by greetings. Ma’am Maritess had a quick recall                     about the previous lesson, because today’s lesson was the continuation of it, which is                     Theorems related to Chords, Arcs and Central Angles. When Ma’am Maritess calling for                     students  to  answer  her,  nobody  wants  to  answer,  nobody  wants  to  unmute  their                     microphone. I felt pity for her, and at some point, worried about myself because these                     students will be my students in few days from now. The discussion took 35 minutes to                      finished  and  ma’am  Maritess  presented  the  synchronous  activities  that  they  need  to                     answer. After that, the class ended with a prayer.                            In conclusion for this day, I noticed that it is always my cooperating teacher that is                     teaching.  The  students  are  silent  and  don’t  even  want  to  response.  For  me,  it  is  a                     problem that must be break because students might have a thinking that It is okay and                      that it is normal. Again, teaching and learning is a two-way process. Both must put efforts                     to make learning not just interactive but also effective.                                                                             15","Day 9: 18 November 2021                            Today  is  Thursday  and  my  third  observation  day  to  my  cooperating  teacher.                     Today’s schedule is from 8:00 a.m. to 8:50 a.m. I joined in the meeting link 15 minutes                     before the time. And as usual, the students in St. Dominic joined late, that’s why my CT                      also started late.                            The preliminary activities were conducted such as prayer, greetings and recall of                     previous  topic.  Today’s  lesson  was  about  theorem  related  to  inscribed  angles.  The                     content itself I believed was delivered well by my CT. You can really see that she knows                     what she is saying, and she knows the topic.                             I was surprised by the students today because they’re now responding to my CT                     questions. Although not as interactive as I was expected then, but I must say that they                     are better today.                            The discussion ended with a prayer. After that, I had some short talks with my                     CT,  and  she  said  that  I  should  prepare  myself  for  situations  that  I  have  seen  and                     observed, and I response that I will. I already have some ideas and strategies on how                     these students will become active learner, and I hope that it will work.                        Day 10: 19 November 2021                            Today is Friday and my last observation day to my CT.  Today’s schedule is from                     9:50 a.m. to 10:40 a.m. I joined in the meeting link before the time, so I waited for a while                     for me to be admitted.                             The class started with a prayer proceeded by a recall of all the lesson they have                     discussed this week. After the recall, my CT used the remaining time for the students to                     answer  their  posttest.  While  students  are  answering  their  posttest,  my  CT  was                     monitoring the Aralinks to see who are answering. Three minutes before the time, my CT                     stopped the students in answering and said that they can continue answering the post                     tests in some other time. And she ended the class with a prayer.                                                                   16","After the  class, I  had  talks  with  my  CT.  She gave  me  the  copy  of  module  10,                     which is the next lesson for the whole next week. She told me to prepare a PowerPoint                     presentation just in case it is not provided. She also gave me some advice about how to                     teach because to be honest, I am really nervous. She encouraged me and told me that I                      can do it well if I will not let my nervousness consumed me. I thanked her and my CT                     ended our meeting because she had her next class.                            Right after the meeting, I downloaded and open the module 10. Upon opening, I                     knew that I wasn’t familiar with the lesson in the module, so I decided to have a printed                     copy of it. Thankfully that my first discussion will be on Tuesday, so I have enough time                      to study well the lesson.                       Day 11: 20 November 2021                            Today is Saturday, and all I did was studying my lesson because I knew in myself                     that I  am  not familiar  with  it  and/or just forget  it.  So,  after I  studied the  module  that  I                     printed, I watched different video tutorials from YouTube about the theorems related to                     circle.  I  learned  so  many  things  in  watching  those  videos,  and  it  really  boost  my                      confidence about me teaching this lesson.                            I  also  started  working  with  my  PowerPoint  presentation.  It  was  based  on  the                     module sent to me. I just added some information that I think the students needed to                     know and added some illustrative examples.                            After I finished my presentation, I submitted it to my CT to check if it alright. She                      commends the presentation I made.                            I finished working with my presentation at around 8:00 in the evening.                                                                             17","Day 12: 22 November 2021                            Today is Monday. I don’t have schedule class with St. Dominic or an observation                     to my CT. So I decided to review my  lesson which I will discuss tomorrow. I also did                     some revisions in my presentation and resubmitted it to my CT.                             I  also  conducted  a  dry  run  and/or  practice  discussion  for  discussion  tomorrow                     because I am nervous. I knew in my heart that I studied well the lesson that I will teach                     tomorrow, and that I can teach the lesson. I really prepared myself with everything that I                     need to do for my first ever actual teaching to St. Dominic. Most especially I don’t forget                     to ask the guidance of the Lord and surrender all my nervousness to Him.                             I am hoping for the success of my first actual teaching.                       Day 13: 23 November 2021                            Today  is  my  first  day  of  being  an  official  student  teacher  in  St.  Jude  Parish                     School. It is my first actual teaching to Grade 10 St. Dominic. I woke up early because                     I’m  too  nervous  and  also  because  today’s  schedule  is  from  8:00  a.m.  to  8:50  a.m.  I                     joined  in  the  meeting  link  sent  to  me  by  my  CT  before  8:00  a.m.  and  I  waited  to  be                      admitted.                            It’s already 8am but only my CT and I were in the meeting. So, I waited for 5                     minutes for my students but after 5 minutes, only three students were joined. I told them                     that we will start at 8:10am while also waiting for others. I started late because there are                     few  students  at  first.  I  thought  that  the  students  don’t  want  me  to  be  their  teacher.                      However, the show must go on, they say. I started at 8:10 with five students. I conducted                     the  preliminary  activities  such  as  prayer  and  greetings.  I  asked  a  student  to  lead  the                     prayer. I also asked them how they are before I presented my PowerPoint presentation.                            Before  I  started  the  lesson  proper,  I  introduced  myself  first,  and  clarify  to  my                     students that I am their student-teacher for the whole second quarter, then I proceeded                     to the lesson proper. We are on week 12 and the topic for today is about Tangent-Secant                                                                   18","Theorem. I call students to read some in my presentation, fortunately they cooperate. I                     just need to call them because they do not initiate. I finished the discussion at 8:45 and                     wrap up the lesson. To end the discussion, I call students to lead a closing prayer. Then I                     dismissed the class. It was only my CT and I left in the meeting room.                             My CT gave me her feedback to my performance. She said that in mastery of the                     subject, I can teach, and I know the lesson, it is just that I had some terminologies that                     are  not  appropriate.  She  also  commends  how  I  engaged  my  students  during  the                     discussion. However, noticed that I am too nervous, and which is not good according to                     her. And as much as possible, I will use English as my medium of teaching. I accept                      everything that she said and tell her that I will do better tomorrow. And we ended our                     meeting with picture.                       Day 14: 24 November 2021                            Today is my second day of actual teaching in St. Dominic. And today’s schedule                     is from 9:50 a.m. to 10:40 a.m. I wake up early, eat, prepare myself and reviewed my                     presentation. I joined in the meeting room twenty minutes before the time. This time, I                      used my cooperating teacher’s MS Team account. So, there’s no need of waiting to my                     CT for her to admit me in the meeting.                            It’s already 9:50 but there are no students from St. Dominic. Then my CT was in.                     She  finds  the  students,  I  said  they  not  yet  in  the  meeting.  Then  I  had  a  thought  that                     maybe St. Dominic students don’t like me because they joined yesterday and today late.                      However, at around 10 a.m. there are three students who joined then right after that, I                     started the class. I called student to lead the prayer and then proceeded to greetings. I                     had  a  quick  recall  then  I  immediately  started  my  lesson  for  today  because  I  have  no                     enough  time.  Today’s  lesson  is  about  angles  formed  in  the  exterior  of  the  circle.  I                     discussed theorem 7 which states that “If a tangent and a secant, two secants or two                     tangents intersect at a point in the exterior of a circle, the measure of the angle formed is                                                                   19","equal  to  half  the  difference  of  the  measures  of  the  intercepted  arcs”.  I  also  gave  my                     students three different illustrations for them to further understand the lesson.  After the                     discussion, I asked my students if they have questions or clarifications, and one of them                     said none. Then after that, I presented to them their exercise and asynchronous activity.                      Then I  asked  student to  close  the meeting  with  a  prayer. Then  I  said goodbye  to my                     students. My CT and I were left again in the meeting.                            After  the  meeting,  I  had  a  quick  and  short  conversation  with  my  CT.  She                     commends that I am much better today than yesterday. However, I should practice more                     on  speaking  and  teaching  using  English  because  she  said  that  I  was  tattering  all                      throughout the discussion. I told her that I will practice more to that aspect. After that, we                     had  our  picture  taking.  In  the  afternoon,  I  checked  the  exercise  that  my  students                     answered yesterday. To my surprise only four out of nineteen students who chose online                     class  are  answered  the  exercise.  I  still  checked  them  anyway.  After  checking  since  I                     have no other sections handled, I took a rest. This summarizes this day.                       Day 15: 25 November 2021                             Today is my third day of actual teaching in St. Dominic. And today’s schedule is                     from 8:00 a.m. to 8:50 a.m. I woke up at around 6:00 a.m. to eat, prepare myself, and                     review my presentation. I opened my computer, set up my drawing pen and tablet, and                     arrived at the meeting room twenty minutes before the time.                            It’s already 8:00 a.m. and there are no students from my handled section. Then,                      after a few minutes, my cooperating teacher joined, and she noticed that there were no                     students. I joked at her and said, \"Maybe they don’t like me. That’s why they’re being                     late, ma'am.\" She laughed but still encouraged me that it’s alright and we just needed to                     wait  a  few  more  minutes.  True  enough,  at  around  8:07  a.m.,  three  students                     consecutively join. I was given hope. I told them that we would start at 8:10 a.m. I started                     at exactly 8:10 a.m. with four students. I still choose to be optimistic and continue the                                                                   20","class. So, I called on one student to lead the prayer and did the preliminary activities like                     greetings, checking of attendance, and recall. Fortunately, during our recalling session,                     most of them still remembered the topic. So I immediately introduced the topic, which is                     Segments  Formed  by  Intersecting  Chords.  The  content  of  the  topic  in  the  module                      provided was too short, so I decided to add additional illustrations. I asked students to                     answer the given illustration for two minutes. After the given time, I asked one to solve                     and explain how they were able to get the answer. After they finished explaining, I asked                     the entire class if they got the same answer; thankfully, some did, but some were still                     confused,  so I clarified  it for them.  After the clarifications,  I  asked  those  who’d  gotten                      confused if the concept and the lesson were clear to them, because I didn’t want to leave                     and end the class with parts of the discussion that were not understood. They said that                     they had understood the lesson, so I presented the exercise that they’re going to use. I                     called on one student to end the discussion with a prayer and said goodbye to them. It                     was me and my cooperating teacher again who were left in the meeting.                            I just had a very quick conversation with the cooperating teacher because she will                     be having her synchronous class with her other sections. \"Congratulations on another                      successful teaching,\" she simply said. She stated that she noticed my improvement in                     speaking and that I was more confident now than on the first two days of my teaching. I                     thanked her for everything that she said, and told her that I would do better for the next                     few days.                            In the afternoon, I checked the Aralinks to see if my students had answered the                      exercise. I checked those who have answered and told my cooperating teacher about                     those students that haven’t yet submitted and answered their exercises. After checking, I                     created my PowerPoint presentation for tomorrow’s lesson, which will be the last topic                     for this week.                                                                       21","Day 16: 26 November 2021                            Today is Friday, my fourth and last day of teaching for this week. And today’s                     schedule  is from  9:50  a.m.  to  10:40 a.m. I  woke  up  at  around  8:00  am  to get  myself                     prepared.  I  opened  my  computer  and  set  up  my  drawing  tablet.  I  also  reviewed  and                      checked my presentation before opening the meeting link.                            I  started  the  discussion  at  exactly  9:50  a.m.  with  five  students.  I  did  the                     preliminary  activities  such  as  prayer,  greetings,  and  recalling  the  previous  topic.  After                     that, I proceeded to introduce our last topic for this week, which is Segments Formed by                     an Exterior Intersection. The content of the topic was short, so I finished the discussion                      early. I present their posttest to them and explain how they’re going to answer it. The                     posttest is given at the end of every week. Then I dismissed the class too early for them                     to have time to answer their posttest.                            I had a meeting after my discussion with my cooperating teacher, and she told                     me that I shouldn’t dismiss the class that early and should follow what’s on the schedule.                     If our schedule ends at 10:40 a.m., I must dismiss them at that time. She also said that I                     could also say to my students to answer their posttest with the remaining time we had in                      our synchronous class. Just don’t dismiss the class too early. I apologized for what I did,                     and told her that everything that she said was all duly noted. The one-on-one meeting                     with  my  cooperating  teacher  lasted  for  about  an  hour.  After  the  meeting,  I  slept  and                     rested.                                                                                       22","Day 17: 27 November 2021                            Today is Saturday, and early in the morning I messaged my cooperating teacher                     and asked if there was already a module for next  week, and she said that there was                     none  because  the  head  teacher  hadn’t  uploaded  the  module.  She  forwarded  me  the                      course outline and said that I could research the topic for week 13 easily. While waiting                     for the module, I checked the exercises of my students from Monday to Friday. I skip                     those  I  already  checked  and  focus  on  checking  those  who  have  just  answered  the                     exercises. I started checking at around 11:00 a.m. and stopped at 6:00 p.m. I reported it                     to my cooperating and she thanked me for what I did. This summarizes this day.                        Day 18: 29 November 2021                            Today is Monday, and I don’t have a synchronous schedule with Grade 10 – St.                     Dominic.  I  checked  my  messenger  and  my  cooperating  teacher  informed  me  that  the                     new module  was uploaded to the drive. She also sent me a copy of the module so I                     could see it easily. I told my cooperating teacher that I would study first for the lesson,                     which is about Problem Solving Involving Circles. This topic is related to our previous                      lesson.  But  still,  I  decided  to  research  and  watch  some  of  the  same  discussions  on                     YouTube. This is my way of thinking and adapting techniques and strategies from the                     lectures that I have watched.                            While studying the lesson, I’m also thinking about the design of my PowerPoint                     presentation  and  how  I  would  like  my  presentation  to  be.  Today  I  also  made  a  draft                      presentation about our topic.                            Time flies by so fast, and it’s already 5:30 p.m. I finished what I could today and                     will continue it tomorrow because tomorrow is a holiday, and we don’t have classes.                                                                          23","Day 19: 30 November 2021                            Today  was  supposedly  my  fifth  day  of  teaching  Grade  10  -  St.  Dominic,  but                     because it is a holiday, Andres Bonifacio Day, the class was suspended. However, I just                     kept studying for the lesson, but I found the module to be lacking in content, so I asked                      my  cooperating  teacher  if  I  could  include  the  Polya's  Step  in  Problem  Solving  in  our                     discussion,  and  she  agreed.  She  said  that  it  was  a  better  idea.  I  also  finished  the                     PowerPoint presentation for the whole week and sent it to my cooperating teacher for                     checking. After that, I did a dry run for me to practice everything that I would be saying.                        Day 20: 1 December 2021                            Today’s schedule is from 9:50 a.m. to 10:40 a.m. I woke up early to get myself                     prepared as well as to set up my teaching equipment. I was already in the meeting at                     around  9:20  a.m.  And  at  exactly  9:30  a.m.,  my  cooperating  teacher  joined.  We  just                     greeted each other and waited for our students. At exactly 9:50 a.m., I decided to start                     with  four  students  only.  I  called  a  student  to  lead  the  prayer  and  greet  them  after.  I                     thanked them for their effort to join in our synchronous classes, and I told them that I                      appreciated them. After that, I just asked them about our previous lesson because our                     next  and  new  lessons  are  also  related  to  it.  Then  I  introduced  our  lesson,  which  is                     Circles: Secants and Tangent Problems. This topic has only one sample problem in the                     module, so I decided to add two word problems that are related to it. But before anything                     else, I explain to them the steps in solving problems and what I want their solutions to                      their  exercises  to  look  like.  For  the  first  example,  I  explain  and  show  them  how  the                     problem was solved. And for the other two examples, I asked my students one by one,                     and they were able to solve them. After the discussion, we still had fifteen minutes left,                     and I told them that they would be doing the exercises uploaded on the Aralinks. After                     that, I called a student again to close the discussion with a prayer and dismissed the                     class. After the discussion, I will just have a very quick conversation with my cooperating                                                                   24","teacher because she will be having her synchronous classes too. She just commends                     me for a job well done.                       Day 21: 2 December 2021                             Today is Thursday, and our synchronous class schedule is from 8:00 to 8:50. I                     woke up by 6:00 am to prepare myself as well as set-up my computer. Unfortunately, I                     had trouble with my computer, and it won't open. I messaged my classmate, Romeo, if                     he's using his laptop, and he said he doesn't. I asked if I could borrow his laptop, and I                     promised to return it right after my class. Thirty minutes before my class, he brought the                      laptop to our house, which I am so grateful for. I immediately log in to my cooperating                     teacher accounts in Aralinks and MS Teams, and open the meeting link. I stayed calm                     and positive after what had just happened.                            At exactly 8:00, my cooperating teacher joined the meeting. And one by one, my                     students are also joining. I started the discussion by 8:05 with a prayer, led by one of my                     students. I greeted everyone and then proceeded to recall our previous lesson. Then I                     introduced  our  new  topic,  which  is  Secants  and  Tangent  Problems.  Everyone  was                      cooperating, and the flow of discussion went smoothly. Then we ended with a prayer,                     and I dismissed the class at exactly 8:50 am.                            After my discussion with Grade 10—St. Dominic, I had a short conversation with                     my cooperating teacher. I informed her that the module's schedule is synchronous, but                     that we, the students, will only take the posttest. I asked her if it was fine that I wouldn't                      meet my students for them to have more time off screen, and she said it was fine. She                     also commended the discussion today. She also said that she saw my progress and that                     I was becoming better each day, which I appreciated. I thanked her for her words, and                     we ended our conversation because she had another class.                            In the afternoon, I opened the Aralinks to check if there were any students who                     had answered the exercise yesterday. There were some, and I checked them.                                                                   25","Day 22: 3 December 2021                            Today is Friday, and I should have an online class with Grade 10 St. Dominic, but                     since what is indicated in the module is only a posttest, I told my cooperating teacher                     yesterday that I would not meet our students today. I woke up early to send a message                      in our group chat that we don't have a synchronous class and they can use the time we                     have to answer the post-test uploaded in the Aralinks. I also reminded those students                     who have not answered any exercises or posttests to comply and submit their activities.                            In  the  afternoon,  I  messaged  my  cooperating  teacher  to  see  if  there  was  a                     module for next week. She said she had not received anything from the head teacher of                      the junior high school. She even said that she would immediately tell me when there was                     one. If I'm not doing anything, I can check and record the other posttest from the first                     quarter. I said, \"Yes.\" She also said that after I finish those, I can take a rest.                       Day 23: 4 December 2021                            Today is Saturday. Last night, my cooperating teacher sent me the module for                     next week. She said that she had just seen the module, and that's why she forwarded it                      late to me. I did not open the file then. And today, I just opened it, and I found out that                     our lesson for next week is about the distance formula. I knew that I was familiar with the                     lesson, but I replied to my cooperating teacher that I would study it first and would send                     the PowerPoint presentation tomorrow or on Monday. I read the module and there was                     some  content  that  I  didn't  understand,  so  I  tried  searching  on  YouTube  for  some                      discussion about it, and it helped me understand more about the topic.                            After hours of studying the lesson and watching discussions on YouTube, I asked                     my cooperating teacher if I could add information and examples about the lesson. She                     said  that  I  could  do  what  I  thought  was  best  for  the  class.  I  thanked  her  for  being                     supportive  and  for  not  limiting  me  to  doing  what  I  thought  might  help  the  students                     understand the lesson.                                                                   26","I  also  informed  my  cooperating  teacher  that  I  haven’t  been  able  to  make  the                     PowerPoint presentation for the lesson, and she said that it’s okay. I still have a lot of                     time because our synchronous class is still on Tuesday. She also told me that I needed                     to  make  a  chapter  test  which  coverage  is  from  the  first  week  to  fourth  week  of  the                      second quarter. I was surprised but still managed to say yes to her. I also asked her if I                     needed  to  make  a  table  of  specifications  for  that,  and  she  said  no.  After  our  short                     conversation, I went to sleep.                       Day 24: 6 December 2021                             Today  is  Monday,  and  I  don't  have  a  synchronous  schedule  with  my  handled                     section.  I  decided  to  spend  the  entire  day  creating  a  PowerPoint  presentation  that  I                     would use for the entire week. When I am creating a presentation, I always make sure                     that the design that I will be using is appropriate to the topic and also not overdone with                     the  design.  I  searched  for  templates  on  Google  and  found  one  on  the  Slide  mania                     website.  I  also  make  sure  that  I'm  following  the  rules  in  creating  a  PowerPoint                     presentation, which I learned in my previous subjects.                             I started creating my presentation from 9:00 a.m. until 1:00 p.m. It took me that                     long  time  to  finish  because  I  struggled  finding  other  examples  for  the  lesson.  After  I                     finished my presentation, I took a rest. I decided to have a dry run to  practice what I                     needed to say and also to prepare myself. I started my dry run at around 2:00 p.m. and                     finished by 3:00 p.m. and sent the presentation that I made to my cooperating teacher.                      After that, I started drafting questions for the chapter tests.  I opened the modules 9 to 12                     and tried to formulate questions.  By 6:00 p.m. stopped and get some rest because I will                     have an early class tomorrow.                                                                          27","Day 25: 7 December 2021                            Today is Tuesday, and our synchronous class schedule is from 8:00 a.m. to 8:50                     a.m. I woke up early to get myself ready, and I opened my computer as well as set up                     my drawing pen and tablet.                             By  7:30  a.m.,  I  had  already  started  the  meeting,  and  by  8:00  a.m.,  my                     cooperating teacher had also arrived. Because the students were still not in the meeting                     room, I informed my cooperating teacher that I had already written a draft of chapter test                     questions and would send it to her later.                            At exactly 8:00 a.m., it was just me and my cooperating teacher that was in the                      meeting room. She told me to wait a few more minutes. Five minutes later, my students                     joined, and I started the class at exactly 8:10 a.m. with five students. I did the preliminary                     activities such as prayer, greetings, attendance, and recalling the previous topic. Then I                     proceeded  to  introduce  our  new  lesson  which  is  Distance  Formula  and  discuss  the                     lesson that is indicated in the module. I just added two examples because the modules                     are lacking examples. Today’s discussion was good; my five students were cooperating.                     They initiate to answer, even if I don’t call their name. I also found myself not nervous                      while  discussing,  which  for  me  is  a  good  thing.  After  discussing  the  lesson  proper,  I                     presented the exercise and ended the discussion with a prayer. And then I dismissed the                     class.                            I had a short conversation with my cooperating teacher, and she just commended                     my performance today. I thanked her for all that she said. I also kept her up to date on                      my  progress  on  my  current  chapter  test.  I  told  her  that  I’d  be  finishing  it  today.  The                     conversation is not long because my cooperating teachers still have a class.                            At around 7:00 p.m., I finished working on the chapter test and immediately sent                     it to my cooperating teacher. She said that she would check it out tomorrow. After that, I                     rested and went to sleep.                                                                     28","Day 26: 8 December 2021                            Today is Wednesday, and our synchronous class schedule is from 9:50 a.m. to                     10:40 a.m.    I get myself ready and opened my computer as well as set up my drawing                     pen and tablet. At exactly 10:00 a.m., I started the discussion with five students again. I                      did  the  preliminary  activities  such  as  prayer,  greetings,  attendance,  and  recalling  the                     previous  topic.  Then  I  proceeded  to  introduce  our  new  topic,  which  is  the  Distance                     Formula  –  Proving  Geometric  Figures.  The  discussion  went  too  quickly  and  I  didn’t                     notice  the  time  because  the  students  were  interactive  and  cooperating with  me,  even                     though there were only five of them. And as usual, I ended the discussion with a prayer                      and then dismissed the class.                            After the discussion, I had a meeting with my cooperating teacher. I told her that                     I’d already finished the chapter test. I presented it to her, and she said that the questions                     were good. However, there is a required format for the test. She sent me the sample file                     and told me that I should just copy everything in the file that she sent to me. After our                     meeting, I immediately revised the chapter test because it’s due on Friday. At around                     6:00 p.m., I sent the revised chapter test to my cooperating teacher.                        Day 27: 9 December 2021                            Today  is  Thursday,  and  my  synchronous  class  schedule  for  Grade  10  –  St.                     Dominic is from 8:00 a.m. to 8:50 a.m. I got myself ready and opened my computer as                     well as set up my drawing pen and tablet. At around 8:10 a.m., I started the discussion                      with  four  students.  I’m  a  bit  disappointed,  but  I  knew  that  I  needed  to  teach  these                     students who make an effort to attend my class. I still did the preliminary activities such                     as  prayer,  greetings,  attendance,  and  recalling  the  previous  topic.  Today  is  just  a                     continuation of our topic from yesterday. Since we were five in the meeting, not including                     my cooperating teacher, I made sure that my students fully understood the lesson. I let                     them answer the examples I presented, and I let them explain their answer and solution.                                                                   29","It  was  still  a  good  discussion  because  the  four  students  were  all  interactive  and                     cooperative. And as usual, I ended the discussion with a prayer and then dismissed the                     class.                        Day 28: 10 December 2021                            Today is Friday, and supposedly I have a synchronous class with my Grade 10-                     St.  Dominic,  but  since  they’ll  be  doing  an  activity  that  is  indicated  in  the  module,  I                     decided not to meet them. I sent a message to our group chat to inform them that we                     don’t have a synchronous class and told them that they could use our time to make their                      activity and answer their posttest.                            In  the  afternoon,  I  decided  to  check  the  Aralinks  to  see  if  there  were  other                     students who had answered their previous exercises and posttest. I checked those who                     had submitted their activity and immediately recorded their scores. I reported the things                     that I did today to my cooperating teacher and then got some rest.                       Day 29: 11 December 2021                             Today, my cooperating teacher sent me the module for next week. I opened the                     file immediately, and found that it was the same as the previous module. I immediately                     messaged my cooperating teacher to raise my concern to her and told her that maybe                     the creator just made a mistake. She did not respond to my message, so I decided to                     ignore those errors first. I still study and research the lesson but decided not to make the                      PowerPoint presentation today.                                                                                30","Day 30: 13 December 2021                            Today is Monday and I don’t have synchronous class with my handled section.                     and I made the PowerPoint presentation that I will be using for the whole week. I also                     forwarded  the  module  to  my  co-student  teacher,  Josephine,  because  her  cooperating                      teacher doesn’t send her the module.                            In  the  afternoon,  my  cooperating  teacher  told  me  that  this  week  would  be  the                     chapter test examination for our student. She forgot to tell me about it because she was                     too  preoccupied  with  her  other  responsibilities.  This  means  that  we  don’t  have                     synchronous classes next week. I told her that maybe I could facilitate the examination,                      but she said that the exam is asynchronous and will be done through Microsoft Forms.                            I still finished the PowerPoint presentation and sent it to my cooperating teacher.                     I asked her about the things that I could do for next week and she said that she would list                     them down later and send them to me.                         Day 31: 14 December 2021                            Today  is  the  start  of  the  chapter  test  examination.  In  our  group  chat,  I  saw  a                      message from my cooperating teacher informing all students that the exam had already                     been  uploaded  to  Aralinks.  I  also  sent  my  good  luck  message  to  them.  I  told  my                     cooperating teacher that I would be checking the post-tests today and she agreed.                            I started checking the posttest in module 9, which was the first topic in the second                     quarter. I went to Aralinks and found out that out of 19 students who chose an online                      class,  only  ten  students  submitted  their  posttest.  I  didn't  have  a  hard  time  checking                     because the other parts are objective and there is a specific answer, but for those that                     require solutions, there is a rubric which I followed in giving the score.                            After  checking,  I  immediately  recorded  the  scores  in  Microsoft  Sheets.  I  also                     informed my cooperating teacher that I’m done checking the posttest in module 9, and                     will then get some rest.                                                                   31","Day 32: 15 December 2021                            Today is Wednesday, and I still don’t have a synchronous class with Grade 10—                     St. Dominic. Today, we were informed by our adviser, Ma’am Mildred, that the first week                     until  the  second  week  of  January  will  be  our  final  demonstration  teaching.  I  was                      surprised by the news and immediately informed my cooperating teacher about this. She                     was also surprised because I was about three weeks into being a student teacher, but                     still encouraged me to be prepared.                            I also informed my cooperating teacher that I'd be checking the module 10 post-                     test  today.  She  agreed  to  it.  She  also  told  me  that  I  could  teach  the  last  day  of  the                      module on Friday, so we don't have a lesson left before Christmas break, which will start                     next week.                            I finished checking the module 10 post-test at around 4:00 p.m. and immediately                     recorded the scores of my students.                       Day 33: 16 December 2021                            Today  is  Thursday,  and  I  checked  and  recorded  the  module  11  post-test.  I                      inquired  with  my  cooperating  teacher  about the topic  I  would  be  teaching for my final                     demonstration. She told me that the topic was up to me. I also asked about the lesson                     plan format and if there was a specific format that St. Jude Parish School was using, and                     she said that there was none. She told me then that I should create a weekly learning                     plan as well as a semi-detailed lesson plan. I was nervous about this but still managed to                      agree to it.                            In  the  afternoon,  my  co-teachers  and  I  talked  about  the  final  demonstration                     teaching. We  were  both  nervous  and  still  don’t  know  which  topic  we  will  choose. We                     encourage  ourselves  and  stayed  positive  despite  being  overwhelmed  of  the  tasks  as                     student-teacher.                                                                      32","At  around,  4  p.m.,  I  messaged  in  our  group  chat  that  we  will  be  having  a                     synchronous class tomorrow. I opened and reviewed the PowerPoint presentation that I                     made last Monday because I will be teaching the last part of module 12 tomorrow.                        Day 34: 17 December 2021                            Today is the last day before the Christmas break. I woke up early and messaged                     our group class to remind them about our synchronous schedule that is from 9:50 a.m.–                     10:40 a.m. I opened my computer and set up my drawing pen and tablet.                     At  exactly  10  a.m., I  started the  discussion  with  six  students.  I started  late  because  I                      waited for my students for about 10 minutes. And as usual, I started the class with a                     prayer, which was led by one of my students, followed by greetings. I asked them how                     their chapter test was and they said it was good even if it was a bit difficult.                            I told them the reason why we didn’t meet last Tuesday to Thursday was because                     the lessons indicated in the module from day one to four were the same from last week's                     module. Then I formally started the discussion, which was about transforming the center                     radius form of a circle into general form and vice versa. The students are cooperative                      and interactive, which makes the discussion flow smoothly. I presented the post-test that                     they needed to answer and finished the discussion by informing my students that starting                     on Monday is the Christmas break. And we ended the discussion with a prayer.                            After the discussion, I had a quick conversation with my cooperating teacher. She                     told me that it is good that we don't have any more lessons before Christmas break and                      that we are on time with our discussions. She asked if I had made a decision on which                     topic  I  would  discuss  in  my  final  demonstration,  and  I  told  her  that  the  topic  I  was                     considering was the distance formula. She said that it was good and the students were                     already taught about it. She forwarded to me the weekly learning plan template. She also                     told me to focus on my preparation for my final demo. I thanked her, and we ended the                     meeting by taking a picture.                                                                   33","Day 35: 3 January 2022                            As  the  New  Year  2022  enters,  I  was  surprised  that  tomorrow  would  be  the                     resume of classes. So I immediately opened my computer and opened the module 14                     file  which  was  just  forwarded  to  me  today.  I  immediately  studied  the  module,  and                      fortunately,  I  was  somehow  familiar  with  the  topic.  Afterwards,  I  made  a  powerpoint                     presentation  of  it.  I  finished  making  the  presentation  at  around  3:00  p.m.,  and  then  I                     executed  a  dry  run  to  be  prepared  for  tomorrow’s  discussion.  Luckily,  my  computer                     bared  with  me  today;  it  didn't  shut  down  while  I  was  having  my  dry  run.  I  finished                     practicing at around 6:00 p.m. and then took a rest.                       Day 36: 4 January 2022                            Today is my first day of 2022. At first, I was worried that my computer would shut                      down  at  any  moment  during  my  discussion,  so  I  woke  up  early  and  set  up  my                     workspace. Today's schedule is from 8:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. I entered the meeting room                     30 minutes before the time and did some tests, like the present screen. I forgot to test if                     my  drawing  pen  and  tablet  were  working.  That's  why  when  I  use  them,  they  don't                     function. So, I use the pen feature in PowerPoint using a mouse.                            It's  already  8  a.m.  and  yet  no  students  have  joined  the  meeting.  By  8:10  am,                     there were only 3 students in the meeting room. I started the class at 8:15 am, with a                      prayer  led  by  one  of  my  students,  followed  by  greetings  and  the  other  preliminary                     activities. I introduced the lesson for the whole week and the learning objectives. I did a                     quick activity to test their prior knowledge first and then proceeded to the day 1 topic.                     Our topic was illustrating the center-radius form of a circle. During the discussion, it was                     still  a  challenge  for  me  to  figure  out  how  to  get  them  to  cooperate  and  make  our                      discussion interactive and fun. Today, what I did was maximize the chat feature in MS                     Teams because I thought that they were only afraid to talk. Fortunately, it works and they                     interact using meeting chat. However, part of me was sad because it could be fun if they                                                                    34","talked. I do not want my class to be passive, but since it is an online class, I can't push                     my  students  to  be  interactive  this  time.  I  believe  that's  one  of  the  problems  for  many                     teachers today. Then the discussion ended with a prayer.                            After  that, my  cooperating teacher  had  some  words  of  encouragement for me.                      She said that she believes my potential is not fully shown because of the students' being                     passive  and  not  cooperative.  I  was  emotional  because  it  is  true.  If  the  students  are                     always like that, I cannot fully show my teaching strategies and what I have stored for                     them. I  believe  that  the teaching  and  learning  process must  be  a two-way  process to                     make learning happen. Furthermore, I will try to utilize the chat feature again tomorrow.                       Day 37: 5 January 2022                            Today is Wednesday, and is my second day of 2022. Today's schedule is from                      9:50 a.m. to 10:40 a.m. I was worried that my computer would shut down at any moment                     during  my  discussion,  so  I  woke  up  early  and  set  up  my  workspace.  I  entered  the                     meeting  room  30 minutes  before  our  scheduled  time  and tested  my  drawing  pen  and                     tablet. After a while, my cooperating teacher was also in the meeting room. We talked for                     a while while waiting for our students.                            It’s already 9:50 a.m. and we still don't have students in the meeting room. My                     cooperating  teacher  messaged  in  our  group  chat,  but  few  of  the  students  saw  it.  At                      exactly 10:00 a.m., there were two students who attended the meeting. I told them that                     we would wait for the others and would start at 10:15. At that time, I started with four                     students. I asked one of my students to lead the prayer, then I proceeded to greet the                     students.  I  thanked  them  for  attending  the  meeting  today.  Today’s  lesson  is  about                     determining the center and radius of a circle. Some students are still confused about it,                      but I made clarifications before I left them. Since I’m lacking time, I ended the meeting at                     10:50 a.m. with a prayer.                                                                       35","After the discussion, I asked my cooperating teacher if there was something that                     she would like to do, and she said no. She instead told me to focus on my preparation for                     my  final  demonstration  next  week.  And  that's  what  I  did  after  I  had  my  synchronous                     discussion.                       Day 38: 6 January 2022                             Today’s schedule is from 9:50 a.m. to 10:40 a.m. I opened my computer early                     and set up my drawing pen and tablet. The reason why I opened it so early is that it shut                     down several times when it was newly opened.                            I started the discussion at exactly 9:50 a.m. with four students. Today's topic is                     about  the  graphs  of  a  circle.  I  made  sure  that  I  delivered  the  lesson  well  so  that  my                     students would understand it. To accomplish this, I taught my students how to graph a                      circle, including the steps, then I let them graph the circle on their own, and we checked                     their work. Fortunately, my students participated this time, which made  the discussion                     flow smoothly. I asked them if they had any clarifications about today’s topic, and they                     said none, so we ended the discussion with a prayer.                            After the discussion, I had a quick conversation with my cooperating teacher. I                     told her that I’m still working on my lesson plan and powerpoint presentation. I told her                     that I was not confident with my lesson plan and I did not know if I would deliver my                      chosen topic properly. She encouraged me to think positively and that everything would                     be fine if I practiced and studied the lesson. I thank her for uplifting my spirit.                            I  spend  my  time  in  the  afternoon  focusing  on  my  preparation  for  my  final                     demonstration. Then I took a rest by 6:00 p.m.                                                                               36","Day 39: 7 January 2022                            Today is Friday, and our last meeting for this week. I woke up early to open my                     computer because today’s schedule is from 8:00 a.m. to 8:50 a.m. I opened the meeting                     room 30 minutes before our time and set up my drawing pen and tablet.                             At exactly 8:00 a.m., my cooperating teacher joined, and she noticed that there                     were no students in the meeting room. After a while, 3 students joined the meeting. I                     decided to start the class with three students and not wait for the other students because                     I would run out of time. I called on one student to lead the prayer and then proceeded                     with  the  other  preliminary  activities.  I  introduced  our  last  topic  for  this  week,  which  is                      polygon  classification  in  the  coordinate  plane.  The  lesson  is  quite  easy  because  they                     already have knowledge of the distance formula, which they will be using to determine                     some polygon in the coordinate plane. The lesson went too quickly, then I announced                     their post-test and explained the directions to them. Before I left them, I asked them for                     any clarifications, and they said none, so we ended the discussion with a prayer.                            In  the  afternoon,  I  finished  my  lesson  plan  and  sent  it  immediately  to  my                     cooperating teacher. I waited for her to respond first before I took a rest, but she didn't                      even see it in Facebook Messenger, so I decided to take a rest.                      Day 40: 8 January 2022                             I saw that my cooperating teacher had a message, so I immediately opened it.                     She  asks  for  a  favor  if  I  can  make  her  a  powerpoint  presentation  for  the  precalculus                     subject she is teaching. He added that he was supposed to be the one assigned to do it                     now, but because she still had so much to do, she couldn't focus on it. I immediately                     replied,  \"Yes,  because  I  had  nothing  else  to  do  today  except  prepare  for  my  final                     demonstration.\" I asked for the file for her, and she immediately forwarded it to me.                             In the afternoon, I sent the powerpoint presentation that she asked me to do.                                                                     37","Day 41: 10 January 2022                            Today  is  Monday,  January  10,  2022.  I  don't  have  a  schedule  for  synchronous                     classes with St. Dominic. That's why I have a lot of time to focus on preparing my lesson                     plan and presentation for my final demonstration teaching. But how will I prepare if my                      computer  won't  bear  with  me?  At  around  10  a.m.  my  computer  still  won't  open,  so  I                     decided  to  go  again  to  the  computer  shop  to  work  there.  But  I  realized  it  was  so                     expensive, so I don't have any choice but to wait for my computer to open. Fortunately,                     by  4  pm,  my  sister's  boyfriend  lent  me  his  laptop.  That's  when  I  started  doing  what  I                     needed to do for my final demo. By 9 p.m., I decided to sleep early because tomorrow I                     have my 8 am class. So, I backed up my files on my drive and shut down the computer.                       Day 42:  11 January 2022                             Today is Tuesday, and by 6 a.m. I woke up early because of the alarm clock and                     realized that I wasn’t able to make my presentation yesterday for today's discussion. I                     decided  not  to  have  my  breakfast  and  immediately  opened  the  laptop  and  began  to                     create a PowerPoint presentation. I finished the presentation by 7 am and immediately                     prepared myself. I entered in the meeting room at 7:30. And by 8 a.m., no students had                     entered  the  meeting  yet.  At  around  8:10  a.m.,  I  decided  to  start  the  class  with  just  3                     students. We started the discussion with a prayer, and I asked my students if they had                      any clarification on our previous topic. One had, so I gave a quick recall discussion and                     we proceeded to our new lesson. By 8:30, I noticed that my three students had become                     seven. This day, we lacked time, so I wasn't able to discuss the last slide with them and                     told them that we would answer it tomorrow. The discussion ended with a prayer led by                     one of the students.                                                                            38","Day 43: 12 January 2022                            Yesterday, at 5 o’clock in the afternoon, my cooperating teacher forwarded to me                     the  health  break  memo  released  by  the  school  principal,  which  means  that  the                     synchronous  classes,  school  activities,  and  work  are  suspended.  The  health  break  is                      from January 12 to 14 only to ensure the safety of every student, teacher, and personnel                     at SPJS from the rapid rise of COVID-19 cases.                            And today is the first day of the health break. I was supposed to discuss our last                     topic for this week. However, I took the time as an opportunity to prepare everything that                     I needed for my final demonstration teaching. I made some revisions to my lesson plan                      as  well  as  to  my  presentation.  This  day  ended  with  the  sudden  shutdown  of  my                     computer. Good night!                       Day 44: 13 January 2022                            Today was supposedly my dry run for my final demonstration teaching with St.                      Dominic. But since we were on a health break, I was the only one to do a dry run. I used                     Google Meet and recorded my teaching. While watching my recorded video discussion, I                     got disappointed in myself because I couldn’t deliver the lesson properly. I took a nap for                     a while, but I couldn't sleep because of the mixed bag of negative emotions I have. I am                     worried and anxious about my demonstration. I wasn't confident with my lesson plan and                     presentation,  so  I  made  some  revisions  to  them.  It  was  difficult  for  me  to  find  the                      confidence I needed on one of my most crucial days. I am crying inside, but I need to                     finalize  everything.  At  8  pm,  I  stopped  revising  and  took  a  rest.  I  am  hoping  that                     tomorrow, everything will be set in place, and I hope that I will find the confidence I need.                                                                             39","Day 45: 14 January 2022                            Today was supposed to be my final demonstration teaching, but because of the                     health  break  declared  by  SJPS,  we  were  rescheduled.  However,  the  workload  of  a                     teacher  never  stops;  even  there  is  a  health  break.  Today,  I  finished  checking  and                      encoding the post tests in module 11. I also encoded the scores of my students on their                     chapter tests. After that, I made some revisions to my PowerPoint presentation for my                     final  demonstration.  Then,  I  also  started  working  on  our  second  quarter  assessment                     because my cooperating teacher told me that I was the one who would make it. I started                     with  the  Assessment  Matrix,  or  the  Table  of  Specifications.  I  was  confused  and  still                      crawling  at  the  kind  of  TOS  they  had,  but  I  took  it  as  an  opportunity  to  learn.  While                     working, my computer shut down suddenly. I had to stop doing what I needed to do, and                     maybe it's a sign to sleep, because it's already 9 p.m.                      Day 46: 15 January 2022                            Today, Saint Jude Parish School just announced through their Facebook Page                     the extension of the academic health break. I immediately forwarded it to my co-student                     teachers  and  to  my  cooperating  teacher.  I  also  informed  my  adviser,  Ma’am  Mildred,                     about it, and she was surprised that we would be rescheduled again.                        Day 47: 17 January 2022                             Today,  there  was  no  synchronous  class  because  Saint  Jude  declared  an                     extension of their academic health break. However, I continue doing what I need to do,                     such as checking the posttests from module 9 to module 13. But upon opening those                     posttests,  there  were  no  additional  students  who  had  submitted  their  posttests.  So,  I                     started working again on the assessment matrix. After I finished, I submitted it to Ma’am                     Maritess to check if what I did was correct.                                                                     40","Day 48: 18 January 2022                            Today,  I  did  some  revisions  on  the  matrix  that  I  did  yesterday  because  my                     cooperating teacher told me that I can only put one check mark on Bloom’s taxonomy                     per competency. She said that I would rather put a check mark on higher order thinking                      skills (HOTS). I did what she told me to do. There were no other mistakes aside from                     that, so I submitted to her the revised matrix for the second quarter examination.                      Day 49: 19 January 2022                            Even though we're still on an academic health break, I still decided to open the                     Aralinks to check if there are students who settle their backlogs. There were some, but                     not all students who choose online class have completed their posttests from module 9                     to module 13.                             After  checking  and  encoding  their  scores,  I  decided  to  fix  the  sheet  that  my                     cooperating teacher sent me. I also checked if the scores encoded there were correct                     and accurate, and luckily all scores that were encoded are correct.                            In the afternoon, I followed the instructions of my cooperating teacher to create                     draft  questions  for  the  second  quarter  assessment.  The  exam  must  contain  items  for                     Knowledge, Understanding and Process. I put five item questions in the multiple choice                     exam which will fall under the knowledge part, because my cooperating teacher told me                      that  the  exam  must  have  multiple  choices.  It  took  me  a  long  time  to  think  of  other                     questions for the other parts, and I decided to continue it tomorrow.                                                                                     41","Day 50: 20 January 2022                            Today,  I  opened  the  chapter  test  examination  in  Microsoft  Form  using  my                     cooperating  teacher's  account.  I  checked  if  there  were  any  students  who  answered  it                     even though it's beyond the deadline. And, to my surprise, there are two students who                      just answered the exam. I checked them immediately and  recorded their scores.                            After checking, I continued working on the second quarter assessment. I still find                     it difficult to make items for the process and understanding part. I told my cooperating                     teacher that I was not finished and was still working on the exam.                            In the afternoon, I reviewed my lesson plan and PowerPoint presentation. I also                      did a quick dry run, and it frustrates me because at this moment, I still can't deliver the                     lesson properly. After that, I took a minute to take a nap, but it was already evening when                     I woke up.                      Day 51: 21 January 2022                            Today  is  the  last  day  of  academic  health  break  in  Saint  Jude  Parish  School.  I                     checked again the chapter test examination and listed down the names of students who                     have not answered the exam. I also did this to all post tests, from module 9 to module                     13. After that, I sent the names to my cooperating teacher and she replied that she will                     forward the names to the adviser of Grade 10 - St. Dominic.                             In the afternoon, I told myself that I needed to finish making the second quarter                     assessment. I did my best to finish it, and I was able to finish making it at exactly 10 p.m.                     Then I reported to my cooperating teacher, however, I didn't send her the exam that I                     made.                      Day 52: 22 January 2022                            The academic health break in Saint Jude was over. I decided to take this day as                     my rest day since the module for next week was not yet  uploaded in the Google drive.                                                                      42","Even though I want to make a powerpoint for the lessons that I will teach on Tuesday to                     Wednesday, I can't do it either because I haven't uploaded any modules yet.                            Today, I realized that the health break help me to accomplished my other tasks.                     The announcement was also timely because I realized that I am not really prepared for                      my final demonstration if it was happened on my first schedule. But with all the dry run                     that I made during the health break, I learned what I needed to learn, and it made me                     prepared for my final demonstration.                      Day 53: 23 January 2022                            Today is Sunday, and Module 15 has just uploaded onto the drive. I immediately                     studied  the  module  and  thought  about  how  I  would  be  able  to  teach  the  lesson  and                     comprised  it  for  two  days.  Yes,  in  two  days.  Although  January  28  is  my  final                      demonstration, my cooperating teacher told me that I will still be the one who will teach                     the lesson. I asked her if I could teach module 15 for two days because I wanted to have                     a  dry  run  with  my  students  before  my  final  demonstration  teaching  on  Friday.                     Fortunately, she agreed to that idea.                            I first read the module and then made the PowerPoint presentation afterwards.                     Luckily, I was able to finish it at 2:00 p.m. I informed my cooperating teacher that I was                     also  worried  about  my  students  that  would  be  participating  in  my  final  demonstration.                      She told me to message the students one by one, which I did immediately. I message                     the  students  from  online  classes,  especially  those  who  don't  always  join  in  the                     synchronous classes. Some of them replied, but most did not, which makes me more                     nervous.  I  also  informed  my  adviser  about  the  idea  of  making  my  classmates  my                     students in my final demonstration. She was hesitant at first to say yes to this idea, but                     still agreed to it.                                                                           43","I only have four days before my final demonstration, and it makes me feel worried                     whenever I think that I will be having difficulties with my students. But I still keep being                     optimistic. As my favorite quote says, \"expect the worst, hope for the best.\"                        Day 54: 24 January 2022                            Today is Monday, and I don’t have synchronous class with Grade 10-St. Dominic.                     With that, I decided to study again the topic that I will be discussing tomorrow because I                      don't want to be overwhelmed by my final demonstration preparation and forget that I still                    have other responsibilities too that I can't compromise.                             After reviewing my presentation for tomorrow’s discussion, I reviewed my lesson                     plan for my final demonstration on Friday and made some minor revisions to it. I sent it to                     my cooperating teacher for her to sign it. Since I have made revisions to my lesson plan,                     I also revised my PowerPoint presentation. After that, I took a rest because I have an                     early synchronous class tomorrow.                       Day 55: 25 January 2022                            Today is Tuesday, and I have a synchronous lesson from 8:00 a.m. to 8:50 a.m. I                      woke up early to open my computer and set up my drawing tablet. I open the meeting                     room thirty minutes before our time using my cooperating teacher account. While waiting                     for my cooperating teacher and students, I decided to have my breakfast first.                            At exactly 8:00, my cooperating teacher entered the meeting room, and after a                     while, my students did too. I started the discussion at around 8:05 a.m. with a prayer led                      by one of my students. Then I greeted all of them and did the other preliminary activities.                     After  that,  I  informed  them  that  I  would  be  discussing  the  topics  on  days  1  and  2  of                     Module 15, as well as all the remaining topics tomorrow. Then I formally introduced the                     topic, which was about problem solving involving circles. Because the students had been                     taught  about  problem  solving,  the  discussion  went  somewhat  quickly  and  became  a                                                                    44","review lesson. I asked if they had any clarifications on the subject we had just discussed,                     and they said no, so I went ahead with my announcement. I informed them that I would                     be doing my final demonstration teaching with them as my students on Thursday, as well                     as a dry run. I asked them for their support and participation on Friday. My cooperating                      teacher also encouraged them to participate.                            After our discussion, I had a quick conversation with my cooperating teacher. She                     told me not to worry about the second quarter assessment but instead focus on my final                     demonstration teaching. I told her that I would have my dry run on Thursday but was still                     worried  about  my  students.  She  encouraged  me  to  not  go  and  gave  me  words  of                      encouragement. We  ended  the  meeting  immediately  because  my  cooperating  teacher                     would have her class on her other subject.                            After my synchronous class, I took a break for a while. I resume at around 2:00                     p.m., to review and study my lesson again. As the day of my final demo gets closer and                     closer, I get even more nervous. I remained optimistic, however, and said a quick prayer                     to calm myself.                        Day 56: 26 January 2022                            Today  is  Wednesday  and  I  have  synchronous  classes  with  Grade  10  -  St.                     Dominic from 9:50 a.m. to 10:40 a.m. I woke up early to open my computer and set up                     my drawing tablet. I opened the meeting room using my cooperating teacher account, at                     around 9:30 a.m.                             I  started  the  discussion  at  exactly  9:50  a.m.  with  five  students.  I  did  the                     preliminary  activities  such  as  prayer  and  greetings,  then  I  introduced  the  topic  and                     discussed it. It was just the continuation of our topic yesterday, problem solving involving                     circles.  After  the  discussion,  I  present  to  them  their  post-test.  Then  I  proceeded  to                     announce our dry run tomorrow. I told them what they're expected to do in the dry run,                     such as being cooperative and initiative to answer. I also ask for their help to encourage                                                                   45","their classmates to participate in dry run as well as in my final demonstration teaching on                     Friday.                            In the afternoon, I decided to borrow a laptop that I will be using in dry run and                     final demonstration teaching. Because I was really worried that my computer might shut                      down during my presentation, and I dont want that to happen. Fortunately,, my sister’s                     boyfriend lend me his laptop, which I am grateful for.                      Day 57: 27 January 2022                            Today is Thursday, and it's my dry run day for my final demonstration teaching. I                     woke up around 5:00 a.m., despite the fact that our dry run was scheduled to begin at                     8:00 a.m. and end at 8:50 a.m. I opened the laptop that I borrowed and briefly reviewed                     my  PowerPoint  presentation  to  check  if  everything  was  in  place  and  if  the  videos                      attached were all working.                            I opened the link thirty minutes before the time, hoping that my students would                     join early, but to my surprise, most of my students joined five minutes late. I did the dry                     run and executed the discussion as our normal discussion. We finished at 9 o’clock. I                     reminded them to join tomorrow before the time because I needed them to be in the link                     on time. I also told them that I needed their participation and cooperation to make my                     final demonstration successful. And then we ended the dry run.                             After the dry run with my students, I had a meeting with my cooperating teacher. I                     slightly ranted at her, and told her that I was worried about tomorrow, especially for my                     students. She told me to calm down, relax and not think negatively.                            After the short meeting with my cooperating teacher, I decided to rest and sleep.                                                                               46","Day 58: 28 January 2022                            Today  is  my  final  demonstration  day,  where  I  will  be  evaluated  by  a  panel  of                     representatives  from  my  cooperating  school  and  CvSU  Tanza  Campus.  I  haven't  had                     enough sleep because of being overwhelmed by both excitement and nervousness.                             I started at exactly 9:50 a.m. and finished the discussion at exactly 10:40 a.m.                     After  my  demonstration,  I  heard  the  comments  and  suggestions  of  the  panelist  who                     observed  my  demonstration.  We  finished  at  around  11  a.m.  (Please  read  Final                     Demonstration Teaching, page 17)                            After my  presentation, I  had  a  mini  celebration with  my  family  to  celebrate  my                      small win. I thank the Lord for the success of my final demonstration and to everyone                     who made this successful.                      Day 59: 29 January 2022                            I thought that after my final demonstration, I would have a vacation like everyone                     I know who has already finished their demonstration. But my case is different. Yesterday                     I had my final demonstration, and today my cooperating teacher and I revised the quarter                     two  assessment,  which  is  due  tomorrow.  We  meet  through  MS  Teams,  and  my                     cooperating teacher guides me in revising the exam. We started at 1:00 p.m. and were                     able to finish at around 3:00 p.m. After that, my cooperating teacher asked me what I                      planned  to  do  the  following  week,  given  that  examinations  would  be  distributed  next                     week and it is also the examination week. I told her that my teaching internship would                     end by February 4. And if there are students who submitted their posttest and chapter                     tests, I will check them.                            I learned a lot today, especially in making the examination, and I know that this                     learning will be useful when I become a teacher.                                                                          47","Day 60: 31 January 2022                            Today is Monday and the start of the second quarter at St. Jude Parish School.                     However,  Grade  10—St.  Dominic  will  be  able  to  start  answering  their  exam  in                     mathematics tomorrow.                       Day 61: 1 February 2022                             Since the exam is asynchronous through Microsoft Forms and will be available                     until Friday, I will have no other duties except to check the posttest in aralinks and the                     chapter  test,  which  my  cooperating  teacher  has  re-opened  for  those  students  who                     haven't answered.                            I opened the chapter test first to check if there were other students who had just                     submitted their answers, but there were none. So I went instead to Aralinks and checked                      if  there  were  students  who  had  submitted  their  backlogs,  but  there  were  no  other                     students who had submitted.                            I  messaged  my  cooperating  teacher  that  my  internship  would  end  tomorrow                     because I have no other tasks left to do. She didn't reply to me today, maybe because                     she was too busy because it was examination week.                        Day 62: February 2, 2022                            Today is my last day of my student teaching internship at St. Jude Parish School.                      As I looked back at how I started, I really couldn't believe that I was able to finish the                     internship. Although it was not a smooth ride, I am still blessed, grateful, and my heart is                     filled with joy that I was able to teach students while learning to become an educator.                            I wrote a message to my cooperating teacher, stating that I am grateful for all the                     knowledge she has imparted to me. I told her that I appreciated her effort in helping me.                     It was a long message that made me cry while writing because I couldn't imagine myself                      being a student teacher if Ma’am Maritess was not my cooperating teacher. I also wrote                                                                  48","a  message  to  my  beloved  Grade  10-St.  Dominic  students.  I  thanked  them  for  being                     respectful and kind to me.                            It wasn't the internship that I expected to experience because of the pandemic,                     but I would say that the new normal education prepared me to become an educator of                      21st century students. This journey taught me to be patient, understanding, creative, and                     adaptive.                            The internship might be over, but the experience, knowledge, and learning that I                     have gained will never be forgotten but will be treasured forever.                                                                                                                      49","COMMON CLASSROOM PROBLEM                               “No  one  is  perfect  that’s  why  pencil  have  eraser”.  Indeed.  We  all  know  that                     there’s no such thing as perfection that’s why teaching and learning itself is a lifelong                     process. Since the shift to new education system started, there are still flaws with the                     online class even if were on the second year of it, and new problems  are arising that                     need to solve immediately for the sake of the students. Throughout my online student-                     teaching journey at St. Jude Parish School, specifically at Grade 10 – St. Dominic with                      Ma’am  Maritess,  there  are  classroom  problems  that  I  encountered  during  my                     observations  and  while  I’m  teaching.  The  following  are  the  common  problems  I                     encountered:                            Internet  connection.  We  all  know  that  not  all  can  afford  to  have  internet                     connection  at  home.  Even  my  students  are  in  a  private  school,  not  all  of  them  have                      internet connection at home. Or if they do have, the slow internet connection becomes                     the problem. We all know that this thing is beyond our ability. Even if we want to speed it                     up, we can't because we know that the internet connection in the Philippines is weak.                     And  most  of  the  students  reasoned  this,  they  don’t  have  internet  connection.  But  I                     believe in a saying that “if there’s a will there’s a way”. Since we all have experience the                     first year of online class, students must have thought of a way how they will be able to                     learn. How they will be able to attend the classes and how will be able to submit activities                      on time. The pandemic taught us to be resourceful, let’s be resourceful also to learning.                     Whenever  I  experienced  this,  I  immediately  went  to  the  nearest  computer  shop.  This                     way, I can still teach;                            Gadget/Laptop/Computer.  I  knew  that  not  all  students  can  afford  to  buy  new                     gadget/s  that  they  can  used  for  online  class  but  a  phone  with  camera,  microphone,                      average phone storage is enough for high school students. Most of my students whom I                     called during the discussion reasoned that their microphone is not working, or if I asked                                                                   50","them to open their camera, they will reason that their camera is not working. But they still                     choose the online class type of learning even though they knew from themselves that the                     primary requirements of online class is a gadget whether its phone, laptop or computer.                     Whenever I encounter such technical difficulty, I always went to the nearest computer                      shop to me. I talked to the owner if I could hold my online class inside their shop, and I                     am grateful that they allowed me;                            Punctuality. Being punctual and/or on time to synchronous class or even in life                     in  general  is  a  phase  of  self-discipline  and  an  evidence  of  respect  to  yourself  and  to                     everyone whom you made a commitment. Every synchronous class, most students from                      St. Dominic joined 5 to 10 or more minutes late to our schedule. I don’t know if they are                     like that to their other subjects or their just used to that doings to mathematics subject.                     Sometimes  I  also  felt  that  they  don’t  want  me  to  teach  them  because  they’re  very                     consistent to it. They are always late in the meeting. With this problem, I always remind                     them  to  join  on  or  before  the  time.  I  even  message  in  our  group  chat  that  they  can                     already join because the meeting is open;                            Attendance.  at  the  very  start  of  school  year,  students  were  asked  to  choose                      what  type  learning  they  want,  online  class  or  modular.  Those  students  who  choose                     online class must be responsible to attend every synchronous class unless they have                     emergency  at  home,  lost  their  internet  connection  or  any  serious  problem  that  they                     encountered that will cause them not to attend an online class. Out of 19 students who                     choose online class in Grade 10 – St. Dominic, I couldn’t reach 10 students who will join                      the discussion. Sometimes I have to start my discussion with only three  students, but                     those students were also late so I have no other choice but to start and not to wait for                     others because my time will run out. With this kind of problem, I always do my part to                     remind them to attend every synchronous class. I also reached out this problem to my                     cooperating teacher and she said that we don’t have control to this because of the set-                     up;                                                                   51","Passive  learners.  This  online  class,  it  is  very  challenging  to  make  every                     discussion an interactive one but teachers put very much effort to this and I can testify to                     that. However, even if teachers put extra effort to make online classes interactive and                     collaborative,  it  will  be  difficult  if  the  students  are  not  cooperative.  Remember  that                      teaching and learning is a two-way process. With this problem, I always put in mind that I                     needed my student’s cooperation. Most of the time, I asked students to lead a prayer. I                     also  asked  them  to  read  what’s  on  the  screen.  During  our  discussion  that  requires                     solutions, I always call out students to solve and I let them explain their solutions. With                     this ways, I made sure that students are not passive, and I can easily know if they’re                      learning something, and what they learned is right; and lastly                            Submission. I always noticed that my students always submit their activities late.                     Out of nineteen students who chose online class, only five of them were consistent in                     passing the activities on time. Even on taking the quarterly examination, some were also                     late.  With  this  problem,  I  always  update  my  checklists  of  student’s  submission  of                     activities.  I  message  those  students  who  haven’t  even  uploaded  at  least  one  activity.                     Then I found out that they took the printed examination and module. With this problem,                      since I can’t control the will of my students, I always put extra effort by messaging those                     who don’t submit and/or took the examinations.                            With all the common problems that I have enumerated, it can’t easily resolve by                     common  solutions  because  we  are  not  on  the  traditional  learning  setting.  For  this  to                     solve, students should cooperative thoroughly to the teachers.                                                                                   52","FINAL DEMONSTRATION TEACHING                               Final  demonstration  teaching  is  the  last  step  in  a  student-teaching  internship                     program.  In  this  final  step,  the  student-teacher  will  be  assessed  and  evaluated  by                     different panelists to see if he/she is ready to be sent out into the actual field of teaching.                     Some said that the final demonstration teaching day was the day of the final verdict. In                     this section, you’ll be able to read about my journey to my final demonstration teaching.                     This  includes  the  preparations  I  made  before  and  during  the  final  demonstration  of                      teaching. You'll be able to read about the struggles and challenges I faced throughout                     my  preparations  and  my  reflections  on  my  performance  in  my  final  demonstration                     teaching.                            When we were notified about the schedule for the final demonstration teaching, I                     got  nervous  and,  at  the  same  time,  excited.  I  immediately  informed  my  cooperating                      teacher  about  it,  and  she  was  shocked  because  I  was  only  teaching  for  about  three                     weeks and there was already a schedule for final demonstration teaching. I asked her                     about the topic that I would teach in my final demonstration, and she said that it’s up to                     me. She also said that I could teach the lesson that we had already discussed, which I                     agreed to and was grateful for. With what she said, I felt relieved somehow.                            Although the topic was up to me, I still struggled with deciding which lesson to                     teach.  But  thankfully,  before  the  Christmas  break,  I  finally  made  a  decision  that  the                      standard  equation  of  a  circle  is  what  I  am  going  to  teach  in  my  final  demonstration                     teaching. I informed my cooperating teacher about this and she agreed to it. I also asked                     her  if  there  was  a  specific  format  for  the  lesson  plan  and  she  said  there  was  none                     because they’re not required to do it, but they make a weekly lesson plan and she sent                     me a sample. I patterned my lesson plan from the file sample that she gave me. But she                      required  me  to  make  a  weekly  lesson  plan  as  well  as  a  specific  lesson  plan  for  my                     chosen topic. I felt nervous again but still managed to agree with what she said.                                                                   53","It was December 27, 2021, when I started working on my lesson plan as well as                     the weekly lesson plan that my cooperating teacher asked me to do. I started working                     first with the weekly lesson plan because I thought it looked easy to make because you                     would  just  copy  the  topic,  objectives,  and  assessment  from  the  learning  material  or                      module. On that same day, I finished working on the weekly learning plan. I immediately                     sent it to my cooperating teacher to check whether what I did was right or if there was a                     mistake. I hadn’t received any response from her on that day, so I thought that she was                     still busy because we were still on Christmas break.                            I  let  the  Christmas  break  finish  before  I  started  working  again  on  my  official                      lesson plan for my final demonstration teaching. Right after I finished it, I immediately                     sent it to my cooperating teacher. She corrected minor errors in my lesson plan, like the                     construction of directions. She also said that my lesson plan is good enough already, but                     she also suggested that I try to think of other motivational activities that would fit better                     into the lesson.                            While  juggling  with  student-teacher  workloads  as  well  as  the  pressure  in  the                     preparations for my final demonstration, I still managed to finish my lesson plan as well                      as its PowerPoint presentation. In creating my instructional materials, I made sure that                     they were simple but attractive. I also made sure that I would put videos and/or pictures                     aside from texts. I also made sure that I followed the rules in making the PowerPoint                     presentation. I was able to finish these two before my supposedly final demonstration.                     Why supposedly? Because the first schedule that I chose was on January 14. Due to                      simultaneous  workloads,  I  asked  Ma’am  Mildred,  my  adviser,  if  it  was  possible  to                     reschedule me on January 18. Fortunately, she approved. However, St. Jude announced                     that January 17–21 was their academic break. This meant that my final demonstration                     teaching was rescheduled again. And I decided to make it on January 28, 2022.                                                                         54","The preparations are indeed challenging, tiring, and stressful. But I know it goes                     along  with  the  journey  of  being  a  teacher.  Even  though  many  problems  have  gone                     through, I also know that they are preparing me for a better future.                            The day before my final demonstration, I reminded my students about my final                      demonstration and that they needed to attend the meeting on or before the scheduled                     time. Unfortunately, nobody replied, but they had seen my message, and it made me                     nervous and worried again. I messaged my classmates and asked for a favor from them.                     I asked if they could be my students for tomorrow’s demonstration. I’m so grateful that                     they’re very supportive and they agreed to be my students. Of course, I consulted my                      adviser first before coming to this decision. In the evening, I sent the link to Maam Mild.                            And on January 28, 2022, Friday was my final demonstration teaching day, and                     my  scheduled  time  was  from  9:50  AM  to  10:40  AM.  I  woke  up  earlier  than  my  usual                     waking time. At around 5:00 am, I’m already awake. I prayed first and asked for God’s                     guidance, knowledge, wisdom, and confidence. After that, I opened the laptop, which I                     borrowed  from  my  sister’s  boyfriend,  because  I  was  hesitant  to  use  my  computer                     because I knew that at any time it might shut down, and I didn’t want that to happen                      during my demonstration. I opened and double checked my PowerPoint presentation. I                     prepared myself at around 7:00 AM; I took a bath and put on some make-up. At around                     8:00  AM,  I  messaged  my  students  again  to  remind  them.  As  the  time  of  my  final                     demonstration  approached,  I  became  even  more  nervous.  But  to  relieve  myself  from                     that, I listened to music while waiting.                             At around 9:30 AM, I opened the meeting link. While waiting for the others to join,                     I  presented  my  PowerPoint  presentation  on  the  screen.  I  saw  my  classmates  and                     students joining one by one, as well as the panelists from St. Jude Parish School, Inc.,                     including  Mrs.  Maritess,  my  cooperating  teacher.  I  also  saw  the  panel  members  from                     Cavite  State  University-Tanza  Campus  were  Ma’am  Mildred,  our  adviser  and                     Department  Chair  of  the  Teacher  Education  Department;  Ma’am  Estie,  student-                                                                   55","internship  coordinator;  and  Ms.  Gerry  Mae,  one  of  our  instructors.  My  adviser  told  us                     then that we didn’t need to acknowledge the presence of the panelist so that my students                     could focus on the discussion, and that’s what I did.                             At exactly 9:50 AM, I started my discussion. I started with a prayer. I called on                      Anpe, one of my students, to lead the prayer, and then I proceeded with greetings. I also                     checked  the  attendance.  During  synchronous  class,  I  presented  the  rules  and                     emphasized  two  points  to  them.  First  is  that  they  need  to  open  their  cameras  all                     throughout the class, and second, to turn off their microphones when I’m discussing. At                     the beginning of my discussion, I felt very nervous and it was obvious in my voice, but I                      still had to continue and focus on my topic.                            Recalling the previous topic is where I consume a lot of time. Nobody wants to                     initiate answering the simple question, \"What was our previous topic?\", so I call out a                     name.  I  was  very  disappointed  at  those  times  because  that  was  not  the  interaction  I                     expected  with  my  student.  But  I  continued.  I  remained  calm  and  smiled  so  that  they                     would  not  feel  my  frustration.  So  I  realized  that  no  matter  what  happens  during  the                     discussion,  I  will  just  enjoy  the  time  I  spend  discussing  my  topic.  At  this  moment,  I                      started to get rid of my nervousness and started enjoying the time.                            During  the  motivational  activity,  I  read  the  instructions  and  clarified  to  my                     students if they had understood it clearly, and they said yes. So I said that they were on                     a timer, so they’d better hurry answering. I clicked the timer and my students answered.                     After the set timer, we checked their answers. I called out students one by one, and all of                      them  had  the  correct  answer.  I  congratulated  all  of  them  for  a  job  well  done,  and  I                     proceeded to introduce our new topic.                            During the discussion, I really tried my best to use the English language as my                     medium  of  instruction,  but  I  also  used  Filipino  if  there  were  phrases  I  needed  my                     students to understand. I started explaining the concept of our topic. I also presented                     illustrations and I called students to help me solve it. During the discussion, my students                                                                   56","were very cooperative. They answer when I call them, and sometimes they initiate the                     answer, which I appreciate. While discussing, I also don’t forget to smile and throw my                     students some jokes to make the discussion light.                            For  the  application,  I  prepared  some  questions  that  they  needed  to  solve                      individually. I also prepared a timer for this. At this point, I call out to the students to read                     the directions, and I only clarify if they have understood it. I gave them five minutes to                     answer the activity. After the given time, I asked students to answer as well as explain                     how they came up with their solutions. I gave them words of appreciation like \"very good\"                     and  \"good  job\".  For  our  assessment,  I  presented  the  activity  that  they  were  going  to                      answer. I stated that it had been uploaded to Aralinks and that the submission would be                     made next week. Before I ended our discussion, I asked my students if they had any                     questions or clarifications. They said none. So I called out to the student to close the                     discussion  with  a  prayer.  After  that,  we  said  goodbye  to  each  other.  At  this  point,                     somehow I felt relieved that I'd finally finished the discussion.                            After my students exited the meeting, I was left with the panelist in the meeting.                     They all congratulated me for the successful demonstration. One by one, they gave their                      comments and suggestions for what they had observed in my performance. There are                     negative comments, but it won’t surpass the positive comments that I have heard. I’m                     still happy and content with my performance because I know I gave my hundred and one                     percent effort.                            After hearing their comments and suggestions, I was encouraged and motivated                      to do better. I know that what I have learned in this experience will surely benefit me in                     the future. I also know that this is just a part of the very long journey of being a teacher. I                     will always treasure the messages, comments, and suggestions I have heard today. And                     I will be forever grateful to those people who helped me make this successful. Above all,                     I thank the Lord for the guidance and love He has given me.                                                                     57","OVERALL REFLECTION AND SELF-APPRAISAL                               \"How  are  you  after  you  finished  your  internship?\"  This  was  the  first  question  I                     heard when I announced to my family that my student-teacher internship was over. And I                     was like, \"Oo nga, ano?\" How am I doing? What did I learn from my internship? Is 62                     days enough to send me into the teaching field? Is what I've learned in 62 days sufficient                     for the battle I'll face in the future? Did the teaching internship experience encourage me                     to continue to become an educator? These are the thoughts I had after pondering that                      question.                            \"Experience  is  the  teacher  of  all  things\"  (J.  Ceasar)  This  student-teacher                     internship program made me realize a lot of things that I needed to do in the profession                     that I chose. It opened my eyes to have a clear perspective on this profession. It also                     allowed me to discover  who I am and  what I am capable of in teaching and in life in                      general.                            This  student-teacher  internship  taught  me  to  be  patient.  The  journey  and                     experience I had with St. Jude Parish School, Inc. was a roller coaster ride, but I would                     say  that  it  was  incredible.  There  were  times  that  I  would  become  impatient  with  the                     students  because  there  were  students  who  didn’t  attend  the  synchronous  classes;                     students who didn’t submit their activities on time; and students who wouldn’t cooperate                     and interact with you during the discussions. When these things happen, I always remind                      myself that in the situation that I am in, I am a teacher and must extend patience and                     understanding. But when I reached my limit, it taught me to pause for a while, think, and                     then talk with calmness to my students.                            This internship also taught me to be persistent. It taught me to have a goal, which                     motivates  and  drives  me  to  do  my  tasks  as  a  student  teacher.  Teaching  is  indeed  a                      noble  profession,  but  if  you  don't  have  the  perseverance  to  continue  with  the                     responsibilities included in this profession, you will lose your passion and will start asking                                                                   58","yourself if you are really for this. Being persistent is having the attitude that even though                     you are hurting and having a hard time, you will still do what you need to do.                            This internship also taught me that it is okay not to be okay. That it is okay to                     show other people your vulnerability. I am not the type of person that would tell others                      how  worried  and  nervous  I  am,  and  I  don’t  even  show  them  that  weakness  of  mine,                     maybe because I don’t want to look weak to them. But the entire teaching internship, I                     was open to my cooperating teacher. I always tell her that I am worried and nervous.                     She taught me that it has a good and bad side. The positive side would indicate that I am                     not overly confident in myself and my abilities. However, it is bad if I allow myself to be                      overcome by nervousness, as it will affect my performance.                            The  internship  also  taught  me  how  to  manage  my  time  properly.  It  is  very                     important to know what to prioritize. I recall a time when I didn't know what to do after my                     synchronous class discussion because I needed to prepare for my final demonstration                     teaching, but I also needed to finish the second quarter assessment because its deadline                     was approaching. I finished my second quarter exam, and then I immediately proceeded                     to my preparation for my final demonstration teaching.                             The  internship  also  taught  me  to  become  resourceful.  My  online  teaching                     equipment has failed me several times, including when there was no internet connection.                     But it doesn’t stop me from doing my responsibilities. When my computer doesn’t work or                     I have no internet connection, I always go to the nearest computer shop with me. I was                     not  afraid  to  ask  if  I  could  teach  in  their  shop,  because  as  teachers,  we  should  do                      whatever we can to meet and teach our students. As they always say, \"Do whatever it                     takes.\"                            Although teaching was not my first choice of program, through this internship, it                     opened  my  eyes  and  I  saw  how  rewarding  it  is  to  be  a  teacher.  My  heart  was                     overwhelmed the first time my students called me \"Ma'am,\" and I can’t explain the joy I                     felt inside. The first time I virtually met my students, I couldn’t believe that I would be part                                                                   59","of and contribute to their success. But there is also a part of me questioning myself if I                     can really be the teacher they deserve, even though it is just for a short time. But, this                     internship also taught me to trust myself, trust the preparation I made, trust the process,                     and trust the Lord. I wasn’t that confident in my teaching skills and in my ability to deliver                      and communicate. But with enough preparation and practice, as well as being not afraid                     to ask for help from my cooperating teacher, I have been able to deliver each lesson                     properly.                            Now, after reflecting on my internship and realizing some things, is that enough to                     send me into the teaching field? Is that sufficient for the battle I'll face in the future? I                      would  say  that  this  internship  that  is  held  online  doesn’t  compromise  the  skills,                     knowledge,  and  experience  that  I  should  get  in  the  face-to-face  internship  but  rather                                                st                    makes it even better for 21  century teachers. This internship taught me that we can do                    things and do them well even when we are sitting in front of computers. This internship                     made me realize that there are alternative ways of teaching that will not compromise the                     quality of education you can offer your students.                            I  learned  different  things  when  it  comes  to  teaching  online,  like  the  different                      educational platforms. Although it is difficult for both students and teachers because they                     are new to the new normal set-up of education, I know that this will enhance the quality                     of teaching and learning we have. It also prepared me to be a 21st century educator for                     21st  century  learners  and  classrooms.  I  may  have  faced  numerous  challenges,  but  I                     have gained experience from them that I can use if that problem happens to me again.                             After  all  the  things  I  have  experienced  during  my  internship,  and  after                     experiencing  the  teaching  responsibilities  at  first  hand,  and  all  the  hardship  I  have                     experienced, I would say that the internship still encourages me to pursue teaching after                     graduation. I want to serve the youth and future of my country. I want to contribute to                     their success and be a witness to their growth. I also want to experience the rewarding                                                                      60","part of being a teacher. These things that I want will never happen if I go on any other                     path other than teaching.                            Overall, I know that what I have experienced in this internship is not the limit of                     what  I  can  experience  in  the  actual  field.  I  also  know  that  there  were  lots  of  things                      prepared for me and the rest are yet to be seen by me. The most important thing for me                     now is to value and treasure everything I've learned from my cooperating teacher, the                     panelists'  comments  and  suggestions,  my  students,  my  classmates,  and,  most                     importantly, my instructors.                                                                                                                              61","REFERENCES                        Julianes, S.
