their  exercises  to  look  like.  For  the  first  example,  I  explain  and  show  them  how  the :@0.151220:0.731493:0.884339:0.731493:0.884339:0.716872:0.151220:0.716872:0.005230:0.010311:0.010255:0.004024:0.006231:0.005155:0.003894:0.010311:0.009031:0.010311:0.006175:0.009272:0.004117:0.009272:0.010237:0.009272:0.005155:0.003894:0.005230:0.010070:0.005155:0.003894:0.004024:0.010311:0.010051:0.009458:0.005155:0.003894:0.004024:0.004024:0.009458:0.010311:0.005007:0.005155:0.003894:0.011331:0.010237:0.006231:0.005155:0.003690:0.005230:0.010311:0.010255:0.005155:0.003690:0.005415:0.003839:0.006231:0.009272:0.005044:0.005155:0.003894:0.010311:0.009031:0.010311:0.015448:0.010125:0.004024:0.010311:0.005155:0.005155:0.003950:0.005230:0.005155:0.003894:0.010311:0.009031:0.010311:0.004006:0.010311:0.004006:0.010311:0.005155:0.003857:0.010311:0.010255:0.010311:0.005155:0.003857:0.009272:0.010311:0.010255:0.013111:0.005155:0.004098:0.005230:0.010311:0.010255:0.015503:0.005155:0.003894:0.010311:0.010880:0.013111:0.005155:0.003894:0.005230:0.010070:0.010070:0.005155
problem was solved. And for the other two examples, I asked my students one by one, :@0.151220:0.761567:0.883844:0.761567:0.883844:0.746946:0.151220:0.746946:0.010311:0.006175:0.010311:0.010311:0.004006:0.010311:0.015448:0.006676:0.013111:0.010311:0.009272:0.006602:0.009272:0.010311:0.004006:0.009068:0.010311:0.010255:0.005230:0.006639:0.012295:0.010311:0.010255:0.006435:0.005415:0.010311:0.006175:0.006472:0.005230:0.010311:0.010255:0.006639:0.010070:0.005230:0.010311:0.010255:0.006231:0.006435:0.005230:0.013111:0.010311:0.006602:0.010311:0.009031:0.010459:0.015503:0.010311:0.004006:0.010311:0.009272:0.005155:0.006491:0.005230:0.006639:0.010311:0.009031:0.009458:0.010311:0.010255:0.006435:0.015503:0.009068:0.006639:0.009272:0.005230:0.010311:0.010255:0.010070:0.010311:0.005155:0.009272:0.006695:0.010311:0.010255:0.010311:0.006602:0.010311:0.009031:0.006639:0.010311:0.010255:0.010311:0.005007:0.005155
