Question (BSP 1-Trece): Do we need to pay any fees?

Answer (Ms. Busog): Yes, but we are still waiting for the account from Main Campus.                 Question (BSP 1-Trece): How would be the distribution of modules and submission of activities                for those who prefer modular mode of learning?                Answer (Ms. Feranil): There are assigned day for each program, for the pickup of learning                materials and submission of activities in the campus as stated in the virtual class schedule                provided.                 Question  (BSBM-Trece):  What  will  happen  if  we  are  taking  online  quiz,  and  there  were                technical interruptions, is the system capable of saving the status of our quiz?                Answer (Ms. Banag): Yes, it may be saved. The Instructor will just set the time for the quiz.                 Question (BSIT Parent): Will the University provide the students with a copy of University                Academic Calendar and the tutorial on how to use the system and take the examinations?                Answer (Mr. Villavicencio): Yes, calendar will be provided to students through Facebook page                the same with the tutorial which was presented earlier. Since this orientation is in FB Live,                students may review or replay the tutorial anytime since this will not be deleted anymore. And                at the same time, during the first week of class orientation, Instructors will discuss again the                process of using the learning platform.                 Question (BSHRM-Trece): When will we have our OJT which are scheduled last Midterm?                Answer (Ms. Sidamon): OJTs are allowed if it is online.                 Question (GenTri Student): I am a working student; can I still attend to online classes?                Answer (Prof. Sedigo): Yes, you may. Because we discourage synchronous classes.                 Question (Trece Student): Are the learning materials downloadable?                Answer  (Mr.  Ty):  Yes,  all  learning  materials  once  uploaded  to  the  platform  are  ready  for                download anytime as long as you have your device.                 Question (First Year Student): Are we required to attend online class in uniform? Do we need                to buy one?                Answer (Ms. Feranil): No, just wear appropriate outfit that is appealing to the class.                 Question (Gen. Trias Student): How sure that the answers to online exams taken by students                are authentic, since they could search the net while taking the exam?                Answer (Mr. Villavicencio): College set up is different from high school or senior high school.                Examinations are skill based and not knowledge based only. Questions can be reshuffled,                have timer and other strategies, your instructors may set it.                 Question: Which is the best mode of learning?                Answer (Prof. Sedigo): Modular mode of learning are very risky for everyone. Since, there are                limited transportation and at the same time there is increasing number of COVID cases in the                area. But if you really prefer the modular type, modules will be available in a designated area                in the campus entrance where you can get your modules. But if you want it to be delivered to                your doorsteps, yes, it is possible, but you will shoulder the cost of shipping. But we cannot                give  you  the  whole  semester  module  because  that  is  so  many  pages.  That  is  why  we                discourage the modular type of learning. Unlike online, materials will be uploaded to the LMS                or Google classroom or could be send to you through fb messenger, chat groups, email or                even text messages. Synchronous classes are discouraged, so meaning, if you will have the                online, it is not necessary that you spend load for the data daily for zoom classes, no. We will                have  the  asynchronous  type  of  teaching  and  learning.  Because  our  motto  is  NO  ONE                SHOULD BE LEFT BEHIND.                Online is more advantageous, cheaper, or safer rather than modular.                Another thing, we should also invest on this. Especially IT students, not only connectivity but                also having a laptop is necessary in your program.","Question (BSE Student): Do we have the qualifying examination schedule? If ever, will it be                online?                Answer (Mr. Ty): There are previous announcements that it will be scheduled in latter part.                Answer (Prof. Sedigo): The qualifying exam is still face to face and is probably scheduled in                January 2021.                 Question: Do we need to pay for the printing of modules?                Answer (Mr. Ty): No payment. It is free for students because CHED paid for their tuition and                school fees.                 Question (Gen. Trias Student): How about the academic scholars?                Answer (Ms. Sidamon): Only Tulong Dulong and TES are active scholarship grant for this                semester.                 Question (BSE Student): If we have 3-hour virtual class schedule, do we need to attend 3                hours virtual class also?                Answer (Ms. Feranil): No, we prepared the virtual class schedule for you to be aware of the                available schedule for the teacher for consultation and possible queries or clarifications on the                lesson. This flexible learning is a self-paced learning, so you can do the readings or studying                in  your  convenient  time  not  necessarily  during  the  virtual  class  schedule.  In  addition,                attendance is not part of the grading system for this semester.                Answer  (Prof.  Sedigo):  In  addition,  during  virtual  class  schedule,  that  is  the  time  that  the                teacher will post the lessons and made himself available to students’ consultations.                 Question (Parent): I am an OFW parent, can I monitor my child’s performance in the online                learning platform?                Answer (Ms. Busog): Yes, if the student will allow their parents to access his/her account,                he/she will give the username and password of the student.                 Question (New Student): How can we meet our teachers? Are we going to look or contact                them, or they are the one who will contact us?                Answer  (Ms.  Feranil):  Each  section  has  assigned  Registration  Adviser.  They  are  the  one                tasked to look for the students and create a group for the class. Then later, all subject teachers                will be added to the group, so that there will be only one group for each class to elicit confusion                on the part of the student on how to communicate and whom.                 Question  (Irregular  Student):  How  about  if  virtual  class  schedule  is  conflict  with  my  back                subjects, do I need to drop the subject?                Answer (Ms. Anonas): No, flexible learning is self-paced and can do the learning even not                during the virtual class schedule.                 Question: How will the lesson be delivered? Is the lesson/module will be provided for the whole                semester one at a time?                Answer (Prof. Sedigo): Preparing a module is not the easy but almost all faculty have their                modules for one month or until Midterm except for some that they really have prepared the                whole module for one semester. So module delivery, is by lesson or chapter, so that you will                not be overwhelmed by the lessons and the activities.","Program of Activities","Evaluation Results                              CRITERIA                   PARENTS           STUDENTS           OVERALL                 Meeting your expectation                  4.62               4.18              4.19                 Attainment of the objectives              4.54               4.32              4.33                 Topics discussed                          4.69               4.47              4.47                 Input presentation                        4.69               4.17              4.18                 Management team / Secretariat             4.62               4.29              4.30                 Virtual arrangement                       4.38               4.15              4.16                 Over-all assessment                       4.69               4.38              4.39                           Overall Rating                  4.60               4.28              4.29                 Comments:                1.
