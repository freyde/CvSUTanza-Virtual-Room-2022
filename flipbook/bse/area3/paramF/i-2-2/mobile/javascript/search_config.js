In  addition,  an  open  forum  was  conducted  to  answer  the  questions  of  the                students  and  to  enlighten  them  about  the  “new  normal”  academic  set-up  of  T3                 Campuses. During the open forum, various questions were raised by the students and                 were  answered  by  Prof.  Noel  A.  Sedigo,  T3  Campus  Administrator,  and  other  key                officials.                         The virtual orientation ended with the closing statement of Prof. Sedigo with his                emphasis  that  despite  the  pandemic,  T3  Campuses  will  continue  serving  and                 providing quality education and ensuring that no students will be left behind.
