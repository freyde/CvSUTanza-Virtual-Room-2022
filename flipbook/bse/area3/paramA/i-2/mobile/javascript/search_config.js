Mathematics, Natural Sciences and Technology                          GNED  03  –  Mathematics  in  the  Modern World. This  course  deals  with  nature  of                               mathematics, appreciation of its practical, intellectual, and aesthetic dimensions,                               and  application  of  mathematical  tools  in  daily  lifeThe  course  begins  with  an                               introduction to the nature of mathematics as an exploration of patterns (in nature                               and the environment) and as an application of inductive and deductive reasoning.                               By  exploring  these  topics,  students  are  encouraged  to  go  beyond  the  typical                               understanding  of  mathematics  as  merely  a  set  of  formulas  but  as  a  source  of                               aesthetics in patterns of nature, for example, and a rich language in itself (and of                               science) governed by logic and reasoning.   The  course  then  proceeds  to                               survey ways in which mathematics provides a tool for understanding and dealing                               with various aspects of present-day living, such as managing personal finances,                               making  social  choices,  appreciating  geometric  designs,  understanding  codes                               used  in  data  transmission  and  security,  and  dividing  limited  resources  fairly.                               These  aspects  will  provide  opportunities  for  actually  doing  mathematics  in  a                               broad range of exercises that bring out the various dimensions of mathematics as                               a way of knowing, and test the students' understanding and capacity.

This                               interdisciplinary course engages students to confront the realities brought about                               by science and technology in society.  Such realities pervade the personal, the                               public  and  the  global  aspects  of  our  living  and  are  integral  to  human                               development.

The course deals with the nature, as well as the                               factors  and  forces  that  affect  the  development  and  maintenance  of  personal                               identity.  The directive to know Oneself has inspired countless and varied ways to                               comply. Among the questions that everyone has had grapple with one or other is                               “who  am  I?”.  At  no  other  period  is  this  question  asked  more  urgently  than  in                               adolescence  –  traditionally  believed  to  be  a  time  of  vulnerability  and  great                               possibilities.  Issues of self and identity are among the most critical for the young.                               This  course  is  intended  to  facilitate  the  exploration  of  the  issues  and  concerns                               regarding  self  and  identity  to  arrive  at  a  better  understanding  of  one’s  self.    It                               strives  to  meet  the  goal  by  stressing  the  integration  of  the  personal  with  the                               academic – contextualizing matters discussed in the classroom and in everyday                               experiences  of  students  –  making  for  better  learning,  generating  a  new                               appreciation  for  the  learning  process,  and  developing  a  more  critical  and","Form C                                reflective  attitude  while  enabling  them  to  manage  and  improve  their  selves  to                               attain a better quality of life. This course is divided into three major parts: The first                               part  seeks  to  understand  the  construct  of  the  self  from  various  disciplinal                               perspectives, philosophy, sociology, anthropology,  and psychology  – as well as                               the  more  traditional  division  between  the  East  and  West—each  seeking  to                               provide answers to the difficult but essential question of \"What is the self?\" And                               raising, among others, the question: \"Is there even such a construct as the self?\"                          The second part explores some of the various aspects that make up the self, such as                               the biological and material up to and including the more recent Digital Self. The                               third and final part identifies three areas of concern for young students: learning,                               goal  setting,  and  managing  stress.  It  also  provides  for  the  more  practical                               application of the concepts discussed in this course and enables them the hands-                               on  experience  of  developing  self-help  plans  for  self-regulated  learning,  goal                               setting, and self-care.

Ethics deals with principles of ethical behavior in modern society at                               the level of the person, society and in interaction with the environment and other                               shared resources (CMO 20 s 2013). Morality pertains to the standards of right and                               wrong  that  an  individual  originally  picks  up  from  the  community.    The  course                               discusses the context and principles of ethical behavior in modern society at the                               level of individual, society and interaction with the environment and other shared                               resources.  The course also teaches students to make moral decisions by using                               dominant moral frameworks and by applying a seven-step moral reasoning model                               to analyze and solve moral dilemmas. The course is organized according to the                               three  (3)  main  elements  of  the  moral  experience  (a)  agent,  including  context-                               cultural, communal, and environmental; (b) the act; and (c) reason or framework                               (for the act).

Mathematics, Natural Sciences and Technology                          GNED  03  –  Mathematics  in  the  Modern World. This  course  deals  with  nature  of                               mathematics, appreciation of its practical, intellectual, and aesthetic dimensions,                               and  application  of  mathematical  tools  in  daily  lifeThe  course  begins  with  an                               introduction to the nature of mathematics as an exploration of patterns (in nature                               and the environment) and as an application of inductive and deductive reasoning.                               By  exploring  these  topics,  students  are  encouraged  to  go  beyond  the  typical                               understanding  of  mathematics  as  merely  a  set  of  formulas  but  as  a  source  of                               aesthetics in patterns of nature, for example, and a rich language in itself (and of                               science) governed by logic and reasoning.   The  course  then  proceeds  to                               survey ways in which mathematics provides a tool for understanding and dealing                               with various aspects of present-day living, such as managing personal finances,                               making social choices, appreciating geometric designs, understanding codes used                               in  data  transmission  and  security,  and  dividing  limited  resources  fairly.  These                               aspects will provide opportunities for actually doing mathematics in a broad range                               of exercises that bring out the various dimensions of mathematics as a way of                               knowing, and test the students' understanding and capacity.

The course deals with the nature, as well as the                               factors  and  forces  that  affect  the  development  and  maintenance  of  personal                               identity.  The directive to know Oneself has inspired countless and varied ways to                               comply. Among the questions that everyone has had grapple with one or other is                               “who  am  I?”.  At  no  other  period  is  this  question  asked  more  urgently  than  in                               adolescence  –  traditionally  believed  to  be  a  time  of  vulnerability  and  great                               possibilities.  Issues of self and identity are among the most critical for the young.                               This course is intended to facilitate the  exploration of the issues and concerns                               regarding self and identity to arrive at a better understanding of one’s self.  It strives                               to meet the goal by stressing the integration of the personal with the academic –                               contextualizing matters discussed in the classroom and in everyday experiences                               of students – making for better learning, generating a new appreciation for the                               learning  process,  and  developing  a  more  critical  and  reflective  attitude  while","Form C                                enabling them to manage and improve their selves to attain a better quality of life.                               This course is divided into three major parts: The first part seeks to understand the                               construct of the self from various disciplinal perspectives, philosophy, sociology,                               anthropology, and psychology – as well as the more traditional division between                               the East and West—each seeking to provide answers to the difficult but essential                               question of \"What is the self?\" And raising, among others, the question: \"Is there                               even such a construct as the self?\"                          The second part explores some of the various aspects that make up the self, such as                               the biological and material up to and including the more recent Digital Self. The                               third and final part identifies three areas of concern for young students: learning,                               goal  setting,  and  managing  stress.  It  also  provides  for  the  more  practical                               application of the concepts discussed in this course and enables them the hands-                               on experience of developing self-help plans for self-regulated learning, goal setting,                               and self-care.
