 National Competency-Based Teacher Standards (NCBTS) was institutionalized through CHED Memorandum Order No. 52, s. 2007 and DepED Order No. 32, s.

               education to in-service training. It articulates what constitutes teacher quality in the K to 12 Reform through well-defined domains, strands, and indicators
               that provide measures of professional learning, competent practice, and effective engagement. This set of standards makes explicit what teachers should
               know, be able to do and value to achieve competence, improved student learning outcomes, and eventually quality education. It is founded on teaching
               philosophies of learner-centeredness, lifelong learning, and inclusivity/inclusiveness, among others. The professional standards, therefore, become a public
               statement of professional accountability that can help teachers reflect on and assess their own practices as they aspire for personal growth and professional
               development.

               Teacher quality in the Philippines

                       The Philippine Professional Standards for Teachers defines teacher quality in the Philippines. The standards describe the expectations of teachers’
               increasing levels of knowledge, practice and professional engagement. At the same time, the standards allow for teachers’ growing understanding, applied
               with increasing sophistication across a broader and more complex range of teaching/learning situations.

                       pedagogy grounded on content knowledge and current research. They display proficiency in Mother Tongue, Filipino and English to facilitate the
                       teaching and learning process, as well as exhibit the needed skills in the use of communication strategies, teaching strategies and technologies to
                       promote high-quality learning outcomes.
                     provide learning environments that are safe, secure, fair and supportive in order to promote learner responsibility and achievement. They create an
                       environment that is learning-focused and they efficiently manage learner behavior in a physical and virtual space. They utilize a range of resources
                       and provide intellectually challenging and stimulating activities to encourage constructive classroom interactions geared towards the attainment of
                       high standards of learning.

                       that are differentiated to encourage all learners to be successful citizens in a changing local and global environment.

                     apply a variety of assessment tools and strategies in monitoring, evaluating, documenting and reporting learners’ needs, progress and achievement.
                       They use assessment data in a variety of ways to inform and enhance the teaching and learning process and programs. They provide learners with
                       the necessary feedback about learning outcomes that informs the reporting cycle and enables teachers to select, organize and use sound assessment
                       processes.

                       process. They identify and respond to opportunities that link teaching and learning in the classroom to the experiences, interests and aspirations of
                       the wider school community and other key stakeholders. They understand and fulfill their obligations in upholding professional ethics, accountability
                       and transparency to promote professional and harmonious relationships with learners, parents, schools and the wider community.
                     value personal growth and professional development and exhibit high personal regard for the profession by maintaining qualities that uphold the
                       dignity of teaching such as caring attitude, respect and integrity. They value personal and professional reflection and learning to improve their
                       practice. They assume responsibility for personal growth and professional development for lifelong learning.

                   The 7 Domains collectively comprise 37 strands that refer to more specific dimensions of teacher practices.

                   Domain 1, Content Knowledge and Pedagogy, is composed of seven strands:

 curriculum content into learning activities that are relevant to learners and based on the principles of effective teaching and learning. It expects teachers to apply their
 professional knowledge to plan and design, individually or in collaboration with colleagues, well-structured and sequenced lessons. These lesson sequences and associated
 learning programs should be contextually relevant, responsive to learners’ needs and incorporate a range of teaching and learning resources. The Domain expects teachers

                 PROPOSAL TITLE:    Online Student Teaching Internship (OSTI)

                    I.  Background and Rationale

                              The unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic has seriously brought adverse
                       impact in the lives and way of living of all individuals across the globe. Aside
                       from its severe impact to society’s health and safety, this global health crisis
                       has caused a momentary disruption in business, economy, education to name
                       a few. Education is by far one of the largest vulnerable sectors, in all levels of
                       public  and  private  schools,  colleges  and  universities  mainly  because  of  the
                       greater  number  of  vulnerable  groups  of  students  and  teachers.  Amidst  the
                       challenges and threats of the pandemic, education leaders and policy makers
                       have crystalized the dilemma through coming up with alternative strategies to
                       resist  this  current  disruption.  In  the  Philippine  higher  education,  the  shift  to
                       flexible  learning  in  the  new  normal  has  opened  opportunities  in  the  greater
                       number  of  public  higher  education  institutions  while  private  education
                       institutions  have  continuously  maintained  the  use  of  online  learning  and
                       distance learning.
                              Nonetheless, higher education institutions are still caught in a dilemma
                       affecting the internship program which constitutes a major requirement for any
                       curricular program because of the limitations on physical contacts and face to
                       face  instruction.  For  one,  teacher  education  institutions  are  transitioning
                       through  a  particularly  uncertain  time  in  responding  and  preparing  for  an
                       alternative strategy in its internship program. The present situation should not
                       limit the colleges and universities to train future teachers because it is the most
                       effective way for them to experience and be immersed in the teaching world.
                       Hence, there is a need for the universities, cooperating schools and cooperating
                       teachers  to  work  hand  in  hand  to  provide  an  exceptional  preparation  and
                       opportunity for pre-service teachers.
                              From a legal perspective, the Commission on Higher Education (CHED)
                       through  the  Technical  Working  Group  has  conducted  an  on-line  Public
                       Hearing/Consultation on the proposed New Normal Policies and Guidelines on
                       the  Deployment  of  Pre-service  Teachers  for  Field  Study  and  Teaching
                       Internship held last September 08, 2020.  Relative to this Draft Policies and]]></page><page Index="104"><![CDATA[2


                       Guidelines  on  the  Deployment  of  Pre-Service  Teachers  for  Field  Study  and
                       Teaching  Internship  for  AY  2020-2021,  current  preparations  are  being
                       undertaken to deliver courses by means of flexible modalities.  The Field Study
                       and Practice Teaching courses also need to be redesigned in ways that are
                       compatible  with  the  present  situation.  This  draft  guidelines  and  policies  has
                       raised a fundamental argument on the need to shift from residential or face to
                       face  teaching  to  flexible  learning  in  higher  education  and  learning  delivery
                       modalities in basic education to ensure the health, safety and security of the
                       teachers,  students,  pre-  service  teachers  and  other  stakeholders  during  the
                       time of the pandemic.
                              In  consideration  thereof,  Cavite  State  University  through  the  Teacher
                       Education  Department  of  the  College  of  Education  has  proposed  an  Online
                       Student Teaching Internship Program that conforms to the set of guidelines
                       stipulated  in  the  Draft  Policies  and  Guidelines  on  the  Deployment  of  Pre-
                       Service Teachers for Field Study and Teaching Internship for AY 2020-2021.
                       The implementation of this  Online Student Teaching Internship Program will
                       take into consideration the necessary modifications in the delivery of Teaching
                       Internship given the context and available resources of the Teacher Education
                       Programs  in  the  CvSU  System.  Essentially,  this  Online  Student  Teaching
                       Internship Program will adopt the experiential  learning, new normal learning
                       modalities,  developmental  approach  through  coaching  and  mentoring,  and
                       aligned  with  the  DepEd  Learning  Continuity  Plan  (LCP)  and  Most  Essential
                       Learning Competencies (MELCs).
