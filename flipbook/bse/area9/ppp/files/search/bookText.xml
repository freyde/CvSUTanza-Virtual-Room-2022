               IV.        BEST PRACTICES


                    The  laboratory  serve  as  an  avenue  to  the

                       development of students’ skills which is vital for

                       their  profession.    In  order  for  it  to  perform  its

                       functions, the laboratory users abide to sufficient

                       practices  in  order  to  maintain  its  quality  and  to

                       provide students a well-pleasing work area.


                            At the beginning of the semester, the

                              students were oriented with the guidelines

                              they should abide while working in the

                              laboratory.


                            The students were oriented with the location

                              and use of the first-aid kits, fire extinguishers

                              laboratory.

                            Precautionary measures are discussed

                              before the proper laboratory sessions.


                            The use of various laboratory tools and

                              equipment were demonstrated by the

                              laboratory technician and the faculty among

                              the students.

                            The lights, air conditioner, and other

                              equipment were strictly monitored/turned off

                              right after the class to minimize the use of


                              electricity with exception to some equipment

                              placed within laboratory premises which are

                              under use.

                            Every day, before and after classes, the

                              utility personnel clean the laboratory rooms

                              and maintain the arrangements of chairs and

                              tables and other furniture in the laboratory.


                            The number of chairs in the laboratory

                              rooms was minimized to allow mobility while

                              working.

                            The utilization of the laboratory rooms were

                              bounded to a limited number of students

                              each room to maximize the capacity of the

                              laboratory.

               IV.        BEST PRACTICES


                    Equipment, supplies and materials are the most

                       vital necessities in order to work in the laboratory.

                       The  quality  of  the  equipment  and  availability

                       should be maintained in order to obtain valuable

                       skills from the activities.  The equipment, supplies

                       and  materials  in  the  laboratory  are  maintained

                       through the following practices:


                         Every beginning of the semester, the students

                          were introduced with the basic uses and

                          functions of various laboratory equipment.

                          Hands-on training and practical exams are

                          also conducted during laboratory sessions

                          under the supervision of the faculty.


                         There is a log sheet which registers the name

                          of the user, time and date of usage,

                          supervising personnel and the user’s

                          signature. It allows monitoring of the use of the

                          equipment, troubleshooting of the possible

                          occurring problems and tracing of the person

                          responsible for the possible occurring


                          problems.

                         The number and availability of laboratory

                          supplies and equipment are frequently

                          subjected to inventory for estimating the

                          request.

                         The faculty always coordinate with the

                          laboratory technician to monitor the materials

                          necessary for the upcoming laboratory

                          activities.


                         A stock of accessories for certain laboratory

                          equipment is available under the supervision

                          of the laboratory technician.

               II. IMPLEMENTATION

                    Present evidences that the laboratory equipment,

                       supplies,  and  materials  are  procured  in

               IV.        BEST PRACTICES

                    The  laboratory  technician  frequently  inventories

                       the available materials and tools.


                    The  laboratory  technician  prepares  the  list  of

                       materials needed for purchase request.


                    The  canvassed  equipment  was  included  in  the

                       PPMP and APP.


                    In using the laboratories during periods beyond

                       class  hours,  a  request  letter  approved  by  the

                       dean of the requesting party should be addressed

                       to the laboratory technician and the department

                       chair beforehand.


                    Each laboratory equipment has its own log sheet

                       which registers the name of the user, time and

                       date  of  usage,  supervising  personnel  and  the

                       user’s signature.  It allows monitoring of the use

                       of the equipment, troubleshooting of the possible

                       occurring  problems  and  tracing  of  the  person
                       responsible for the possible occurring problems.



                    The students utilizing computer laboratories were

                       allowed  to  access  the  internet  for  purposes  of
                       research and compliance of requirements for their

                       courses.
