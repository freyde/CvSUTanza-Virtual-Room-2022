The pin releases a locking          mechanism and will allow you to discharge the extinguishers.            Aim at the base of the fire, not flames. This is important – in order to put out          the fire, you must extinguish the fuel.           Squeeze the lever slowly. This will release the extinguishing agent in the           extinguisher. If the handle is released, the discharged will stop.           Sweep from side to side. Using a sweeping motion, move the fire           extinguisher back and forth until the fire is completely out. Operate the          extinguisher from a safe distance, several feet away, and then move towards           the fire once it starts to diminish. Be sure to read the instructions on your fire          extinguisher – different fire extinguishers recommended operating them from          different distances.","USING A FIRE EXTINGUISHER     P  A  S  S      Pull the pin at the top of the extinguisher.
