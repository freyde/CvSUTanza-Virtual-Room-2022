        mechanism and will allow you to discharge the extinguishers.



        Aim at the base of the fire, not flames. This is important – in order to put out

        the fire, you must extinguish the fuel.


        Squeeze the lever slowly. This will release the extinguishing agent in the


        extinguisher. If the handle is released, the discharged will stop.


        Sweep from side to side. Using a sweeping motion, move the fire


        extinguisher back and forth until the fire is completely out. Operate the

        extinguisher from a safe distance, several feet away, and then move towards


        the fire once it starts to diminish. Be sure to read the instructions on your fire

        extinguisher – different fire extinguishers recommended operating them from

        different distances.]]></page><page Index="5"><![CDATA[USING A FIRE EXTINGUISHER
