The Philippine higher education institutions (HEIs) are no exemption in facing such critical                       situations. To ensure the continuity of learning among tertiary students while avoiding and/or                       limiting the risks of infection in the community, HEIs explored and shifted to other innovative                       learning modalities that transmigrate the conduct of classes from traditional to flexible                       learning modalities, which gave students the option to choose the most convenient delivery                       modes to them. This flexible learning modality emerged during the First Semester of                       Academic Year 2020-2021 where it was used for the conduct of lecture classes, leaving                       behind the conduct of laboratory classes that require a more rigid training for students in                       face-to-face classes.                              While flexible learning modality allows flexibility in time, place, and audience, including                      (but not solely reliant on) the use of technology, its conduct varies on the levels of technology,                      availability of devices, internet connectivity, level of digital literacy and approaches (CMO 04,                      s. 2020). As it should complement outcomes-based education approach, HEIs are also given                      flexibility to employ various means of delivery and assessment modes as long as they can                      achieve the set of learning outcomes for each course/subject for the program. With this, each                       HEI was tasked to review their curricular offerings and make necessary adjustments or                       modifications in the course contents/requirements, determine alternative options in the                      design, delivery, pedagogy, and assessment mechanism that can be delivered to the students                      through various modalities.                              Given that Cavite State has come up with flexible learning modalities in the conduct of                       lecture classes, it can also be the case for the conduct of laboratory classes as long as it can                       come up with a solid learning plan for this matter. Hence, we propose to offer selected                       laboratory classes for selected programs at CvSU - Tanza Campus for the Second Semester,                      AY 2020-2021.                      IV. OBJECTIVES:                                This proposal aims to allow the CvSU - Tanza Campus to offer selected laboratory                       classes for selected programs, which do not require face-to-face training to master the skills                       to be taught; as well as on-the-job-training program and practice teaching that can be done                        in a work from home arrangement. Also, the offerings of such classes will complement the","completion of graduation requirements of students who were not able to enroll laboratory                       classes during the preceding semester.                    V. MECHANICS OF IMPLEMENTATION                               On-the-Job Training (OJT) Program and Practice Teaching must only be done in a                       work-from-home arrangement and there must be LIMITED or NO face-to-face interaction                       between the student-trainees and the employees of the linkage where he/she is assigned.                               As for the conduct of online laboratory classes, the following guidelines shall be                       followed:                        A.
