This is also an occasion for them to send each other good wishes                and express gratitude to all who have contributed in the previous year. All activities for this                event will be virtual and will promote solidarity to the community.                   Attached are the proposed events; program of activities; and working committees for the said                activity                   Hoping for your positive response.
