Before                    he officially discussed the main agenda of the meeting, he commended the group for the good                    feedback the campus received during the recently held commencement exercises. He also                    congratulated  the  faculty  members  who  will  be  promoted  with  the  NBC  461  8   Cycle  and                                                                                               th                    thanked Ms. Sebastian for her time and effort in assisting the faculty members in preparing                    and submitting the necessary documents for NBC.                           The  meeting  then  proceeded  to  the  main  agenda.  He  asked  the  chairs  of  each                    department to report. Mr. Banate, the department chair of the Department of Management                    reported that one of the recently hired faculty members of their department has backed out                    and they already posted a hiring notice. However, they only got one applicant. Prof. Ramos                    advised  to  welcome  even  fresh  graduates  to  apply,  especially  those  who  graduated  with                    honors.                           Ms. Senaris, the chair of the Department of Information Technology, then reported that                    they already successfully filled the necessary number of faculty members in the department.                    Ms. Sebastian, the chair of the Teacher Education Department also reported that they already                    have  complete  number  of  faculty  members.  She  then  opened  her  concern  about  the                    deployment of their students as practice teachers for face-to-face teaching. She asked if they                    can  hold  a  face-to-face  demonstration  teaching  in  the  campus  for  them  to  assess  their                    students’ readiness, knowledge, and skills in actual teaching, before their deployment. This will                    be held for 3 days, with 42 Education students and they plan to start the activity the following","week. Prof. Ramos approved the request and advised that they may not deploy the students                    who will not pass their assessment.                           Ms. Fabian then reported about the recruitment of faculty members for the Department                    of Arts and Sciences being completed. She also said that the Job Order  faculty members                    especially  the  newly  hired  should  submit  their  requirements  as  soon  as  possible  for  their                    contracts.                           In line with the preparation of the opening of classes, Prof. Ramos asked the faculty                    members  to  follow  the  prescribed  syllabus  in  their  handled  courses.  He  then  asked  Ms.                    Sebastian about any updates regarding the NBC. Ms. Sebastian told the group that those who                    will be promoted to one to three steps are already certain of the reclassification while those                    who will be promoted to at least four steps will still wait for BOR approval.                           The meeting then proceeded to the next agenda which is the admission and enrolment.                    Ms. Perida, the campus registrar, reported that there are 556 qualified first year students who                    already confirmed their slots but only 369 of them submitted the necessary requirements. Prof.                    Ramos then asked Ms. Perida to extend the deadline of requirements until September 16,                    2022, Friday. Ms. Perida then added that there are already 1200 old students enrolled. She                    also reported that there are four students who requested transfer credentials to transfer to                    CvSU-Cavite City campus but currently requesting to return to the campus because they were                    not able to secure their slots in Cavite City. However, because their transfer credentials were                    already signed and released, their request to return were not granted.                           Prof. Ramos then opened the next agenda which is the campus designation. He told                    the  group  that  the  campus  needs  reappointment  of  designations.  First,  he  will  be  the                    department chair of the Department of Arts and Sciences but Mr. Mark Joel Sibulo will help                    him perform his duties as chair. Second, Ms. Sebastian will still be the research coordinator of                    the campus. He then told the group to include the performance of their designations as one of                    their priorities. He announced that Dr. Polinga already approved the designation of the staff to                    administrative positions.                           He also announced that the campus will no longer have an official campus vehicle                    because he already returned it to the main campus.

For the next agenda, he announced that it was already allowed to use textbooks and                    he suggested that the campus sell textbooks as an income-generating project. Prof. Ramos                    recommended his books to be sold but reminded that the students should not be required to                    buy the textbooks that the campus will sell.                           Prof. Ramos shared to the group that the main campus will be having an extension                    program in Brgy. Bagtas which is planting kaong.

Prof. Ramos                    suggested that the campus anchor its extension program to this activity of the main campus.                    However, Ms. Villa, the extension program coordinator of the campus told the group that there                    is already an approved campus extension program.                           Other matters discussed during the meeting includes the request of Prof. Ramos to                    have a copy of the raw data of the monthly attendance report of the faculty. He added that in                    line with the new HR Memo on work arrangement, the faculty members will continue to follow                    their alternative work arrangement schedule (two days WFH and two days campus reporting)                    while  the  non-academic  staff  will  be  reporting  to  the  campus  four  days  a  week.  He  then                    announced that Ms. Fabian and Mr. Fred will be the liaison officers.                           After  this,  Prof.  Ramos  shared  some  reminders  for  the  opening  of  classes.  He                    reminded the group to be not too lenient to the students. With this, Ms. Sebastian shared that                    the TED will be starting to require student attendance to class meetings.

Before  he  officially  discussed  the  main  agenda  of  the  meeting,  he  requested  Mr.                    Crisostomo Sibulo to lead a prayer. After this, he go through the agenda of the meeting.                           He asked the group about the status of preparation for COPC. Ms. Sebastian reported                    that the preparation is already 80% completed but they are having problems with the facility of                    the campus. She proposed that the faculty room be used as laboratory and lecture rooms. The                    campus  was  able  to  borrow  30  computers  from  the  students  and  proposed  to  have  a                    memorandum of agreement with Bagtas Elementary School and Tanza National Trade School                    for borrowing of additional computers.                           Prof. Ramos opened the concern about the P5,000 being requested by the Department                    of Information Technology for the installation of tiles in the computer laboratory and shared to                    the  group  that  he  already  asked  Dr.  Manuel  about  it  and  was  told  that  the  requested                    improvement  is  not  required.  He  then  asked  about  update  on  the  requested  purchase  of                    equipment and facilities for accreditation. Ms. Sebastian reported that Dr. Polinga held over                    the purchase request because the campus has no available space. Prof. Ramos then told the                    group that because there is lack of support from the administration, the campus can document                    whatever is available in the campus and use the result of evaluation as the basis of what to                    improve in the campus. After this, Ms. Senaris shared the problem of the department about                    the lack of faculty member with master’s degree and reported that she included Ms. Lewis from                    Trece Martires City Campus to the list of faculty.                           Prof.  Ramos  then  shared  that  the  donated  lot  for  Tanza  Campus  was  already                    presented during the academic council meeting. He also shared to the group that he already                    requested to the OVPAA that the campus will continue to hold online classes because of the                    lack  of  campus  facilities.  Mr.  Mark  Sibulo  then  asked  if  there  is  already  a  target  date  of                    constructing the new campus building. Prof. Ramos answered that there  is still no concrete                    schedule about the construction.                           Mr. Banate then reported about their department’s preparation for COPC. He shared                    that he is already finalizing the presentation and was able to borrow faculty from the main                    campus resulting to 84% faculty members having master’s degree. He then told Prof. Ramos                    that Mr. Mintu, the Brgy. Bagtas Chairperson, is asking about the schedule of MOA signing                    with the University for the lot donated to Tanza campus. Prof. Ramos said that it is still on                    process of approval.","Prof. Ramos then shared that the mock presentation of TED for COPC was postponed                    but each department should continue their preparation. He also reminded the group to just                    present what is available in the campus. He then asked for understanding for not being able to                    go to the campus for health concerns and thanked the group for all their efforts.                           After this, Ms. Banag presented the proposed streamlined designations.                           Ms. Fabian then reminded the Contract of Service faculty members to submit authority                    to go two days before the schedule because it needs to be submitted to different offices.                           Prof. Ramos shared that the campus is not oblige to conduct a face-to-face class and                    to  be  able  to  implement  limited  face-to-face,  the  campus  must  submit  the  necessary                    documents for application for F2F and approval from the LGU is also necessary. The faculty                    members  and  students  must  also  be  fully  vaccinated  and  the  students  should  have  their                    parent’s consent.                           Before the meeting ends, Ms. Addangna extended her gratitude to Ms. Sebastian, Mr.                    Delgado, Ms. Fabian, and Mr. Mark Sibulo for being approachable.

In addition, Ms.          77        Elamparo mentioned that BSHM/BSTM students who wished to conduct the OJT shall pay a          78        minimum amount of PhP4,000 to complete their virtual OJT.  Due to this, she made a poll with          79        the BSHM students if ever they would pursue the virtual OJT and pay the necessary amount.          80        Based on the results, most of the students signified their non-intention to pursue the virtual          81        OJT due to financial constraints.          82          83               Prof. Ramos announced that the CHED is now offering Scholarships for Instructors'          84        Knowledge Advancement Program (SIKAP) for faculty members who wish to pursue graduate          85        degree programs in CHED recognized schools.

The College of Education, Office of the Graduate School, Naic          97        Campus and Carmona Campus had already finished the virtual validation.  Prof. Sebastian          98        mentioned that the preparation of the said documents is on-going. There have been some          99        problems encountered as regards some supplies and materials relative to the preparation.         100        Prof. Ramos pledged that the funds shall be available in terms of the campus cash advance.         101        However, Ms. Noemi Perida mentioned that she encountered difficulties in canvassing some         102        supplies and materials because there was a tight budget.  Prof. Sebastian made mentioned         103        that  the  group  also  find  it  difficult  to  get  certified  copies  of  faculty  credentials  since  the         104        University Records Office does not certify copies of TOR and diploma who are not graduates         105        of the university.  Also, faculty members cannot be compelled to travel and get their TOR and         106        diploma as certified true copy.         107         108               Prof. Ramos announced that the class observation shall push through as planned.  This         109        will be from May 10 – 13, 2021.

Before          54        he officially discussed the main agenda of the meeting, he had some announcements for the          55        group based on the administrative council meeting that was held the other day.  He announced          56        that the campus water supply will be provided by the Office of the ABC President, Hon. SM","57        Matro.  He also announced that the PhP4.5-million allotment for the two-storey building of          58        CvSU Tanza Campus has been approved and that the group could expect its construction in          59        the  near  future.    He  further  announced  that  the  PhP50-million  allotment  for the  3-5 storey          60        building of the campus has been approved.  The campus shall seek the assistance of the          61        Bagtas LGU for any donation of land to realize this vision, especially when the campus shall          62        be subjecting four of its programs under the CHED visit to obtain the Certificates of Program          63        Compliance.          64          65               Another  concern  that  was  being  raised  during  the  Administrative  Council  was  the          66        complaints through the 8888.  Most of Contract of Service (COS) Faculty members were filing          67        concerns regarding the delay of salaries.  He sympathized with those faculty members but he          68        mentioned that these faculty members must expedite all possible means to complete their          69        requirements in order not to delay their salaries.          70          71               He  announced  that  each  faculty  member  shall  give  major  examinations,  such  as          72        midterm and final exams in line with the school calendar.  However, faculty members shall          73        have the leeway on when to give their midterm examination, depending on the lessons that          74        were already discussed.          75          76               Prof. Ramos shared to the group that there was an alleged Diploma Factory in Tanza,          77        being posted in the Facebook. This was discussed during the Administrative Council Meeting.          78        He  requested  everyone  to  help  the  campus  in  tracking  down  the  source  or  production  of          79        falsified documents.          80          81               He announced that there will be also class observation after the midterm examination.          82        He requested everyone to submit their schedule of classes for the classroom observation.  This          83        shall be the basis for re-hiring of faculty members for the next semester.          84          85               He  announced  that  the  Office  of  the  University  President  request  each  campus  to          86        prepare  its  dashboard  of  information.    This  shall  include  all  primary  tools  and  general          87        information about CvSU Tanza Campus.
