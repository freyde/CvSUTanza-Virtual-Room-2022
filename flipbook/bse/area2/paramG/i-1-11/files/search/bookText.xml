                          during the school vacations, unless he expressly opts to teach and his

                            engaged  in  such  work  as  research  or  other  assignments  which
                            involve work beyond their normal work load and which prevent them
                            from  taking  advantage  of  the  teacher’s  vacation  leave,  both
                            conditions  being  certified  by  the  Unit  Head  may  enjoy  cumulative

                            is  covered  by  an  appointment  approved  by  the  President  of  the
                            University  for  at  least  one  academic  year.  Faculty  members  given
                            college  designations  by  College  Deans  shall  also  enjoy  cumulative
                            leave  status;  provided  that  their  terms  of  reference  during  regular
