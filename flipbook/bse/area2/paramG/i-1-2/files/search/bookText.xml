                                         Notice  of  absence,  however,  should  be  submitted  to  the
                                         immediate  Vice  President  concerned.  A  proper  medical

                                         excess of five days.

                                         member of his immediate family.

                                 r)  Sick  leave  may  be  applied  for  in  advance  in  cases  where
                                         the official or employee will undergo medical examination
                                         or  operation  or  advised  to  rest  in  view  of  ill  health  duly

                                         days,  the  Head  of  Department  or  unit  concerned  may
                                         determine whether or not granting of additional sick leave
                                         is  proper  under  the  circumstances.  In  case  of  doubt,  a
                                         medical certificate shall be required.

                                  t) Applications of faculty and employees for leave of absence  on
                                         account  of  wounds  or  injuries  incurred  in  the
                                         performance of duty extending beyond the available leave
                                         credits of the employee concerned must be made on the

                                         incurred  in  the  performance  of  duty.  The  University
                                         President  may  direct  that  absence  during  any  period  of
                                         disability thus occasioned shall be on full pay, but not to
                                         exceed  six  months.  He  may,  in  his  discretion,  also

                                         transportation,  and  subsistence  and  hospital  fees  of  the
                                         injured  persons  subject  to  availability  of  funds  for  the
                                         purpose.

                                         any misrepresentation or deception in connection with an

                                         action.
