               I.  TITLE:     TANZA  CAMPUS  FACULTY,  STAFF  AND  STUDENTS’  VIRTUAL
                              RECOGNITION PROGRAM

               II.  RATIONALE:

                          Recognition of one’s efforts is more highly valued than money. The importance of
                   offering awards and incentives that recognize, validate and value outstanding work and
                   accomplishments made  by  faculty  and  staff,  and  students  keeps  them motivated  and
                   provides  effective  methods  for  reinforcing  the  campus  goals  and  objectives.    Any
                   individual who is recognized for simply doing his/her best may have gained an increased
                   level  of  self-confidence,  a  sense  of  accomplishment  and  respect  among  his/her  peer
                   group. Such a feeling of accomplishment may carry forward throughout their lives and
                   ultimately improve his/her well-being.

                          During these trying times, when pandemic has brought about a huge change in
                   the  morale  and  self-esteem  of  the  faculty,  staff  and  students,  it  is  high  time  that  the
                   administration of Cavite State University – Tanza Campus acknowledges and recognizes
                   their outstanding achievements and invaluable contributions to the campus in particular
                   and to the university in general.  Hence, Cavite State University – Tanza Campus would
                   like to conduct its Faculty, Staff and Students’ Virtual Recognition Program for AY 2019 –
                   2020  with  the  theme  “Trailblazing  in  the  New  Normal:  Campus  Empowerment
                   through Peer Recognitions and Awards”.  This will be livestreamed at Cavite State
                   University – Tanza Campus Official Facebook Page on 19 October 2020 at 1:00 pm.

               III.  OBJECTIVES:
                   This activity aims to:

                     recognize  the  outstanding  accomplishments  of  the  faculty  in  their  instruction,
                       research, and extension activities;
                     validate  and  value  outstanding  work  and  accomplishments  and  invaluable
                       contributions of the staff to the campus;
                     honor and credit exemplary achievements of students in academic and non-academic
                       activities they engaged in; and
                     provide a sense of accomplishment and pay respect among faculty, staff and students
                       among his/her peer group.

               IV. PARTICIPANTS

               V.  BUDGETARY ALLOCATION
                          Since  this  will  be  a  virtual  recognition  program,  no  budgetary  requirements  is
