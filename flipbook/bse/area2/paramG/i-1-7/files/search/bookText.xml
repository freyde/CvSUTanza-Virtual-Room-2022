           SUBJECT:      GUIDELINES ON THE GRANT OF THE PERFORMANCE-BASED BONUS
                         (PBB) FOR FISCAL YEAR (FY) 2021 UNDER EXECUTIVE ORDER NO. 80,
                         S. 2012 AND EXECUTIVE ORDER NO. 201, S. 2016




           1.0 PURPOSE

                  This Circular is being issued to prescribe the criteria and conditions on the grant of the
                  PBB for FY 2021 performance, to be given in FY 2022. The overarching goal of the
                  PBB is to strengthen the effectiveness of the incentives system to help agencies
                  achieve the mission-critical objectives and expected outcomes of the government. For
                  the FY 2021 cycle, the PBB criteria and conditions were hence refined in order to:

                      a.  Simplify the PBB process particularly the validation of compliance;
                      b.  Provide flexibility to the agencies in the implementation of the scheme;
                      c.  Reinforce the results focus and their inter-linkages e.g., budget utilization and
                          physical accomplishment, in assessing the overall performance of agencies;
                      d.  Administer a more transparent PBB scoring system;
                      e.  Strengthen the role of agencies in ensuring accountability of units/individuals
                           responsible for the criteria and conditions; and,
                      f.   Facilitate the timely release of incentives to eligible agencies.

                  In line with this, the FY 2021 PBB shall measure and evaluate the performance of
                  agencies with emphasis on the public’s satisfaction on the realization of the agencies’
                  performance targets, quality of service delivery, efficiency in the use of resources, and
                  strengthened agency stewardship. In relation to the targets in previous PBB cycles,
                  the FY 2021 PBB criteria and conditions shall be categorized according to four (4)
                  dimensions of accountability: Performance Results, Process Results, Financial
                   Results, and Citizen/Client Satisfaction Results. Given the progress achieved in
                   the Good Governance Conditions (GGCs), these shall no longer be included in the
                   criteria to assess the overall eligibility of the agency for FY 2021 PBB. However, since]]></page><page Index="3"><![CDATA[the observance of these conditions shall still be used to determine the eligibility of
                   delivery units and individuals, the monitoring of their compliance shall now be the
                   primary responsibility of the Heads of Agencies.

                   This Circular also specifies the modifications in the PBB assessment process to make
                   the PBB Scoring System clear and explicit. The scoring system aims to simplify and
                   make the final eligibility assessment more transparent, and enable agencies to
                   undertake self-assessment vis-a-vis the criteria and conditions to ascertain if they
                   could qualify for the grant of the FY 2021 PBB. However, the AO 25 Inter-Agency Task
                   Force (AO 25 lATF) shall still determine the final eligibility of agencies.



            2.0 COVERAGE

                   The FY 2021 PBB covers all departments, bureaus, offices, and other agencies of the

                   (OEOs), Congress, the Judiciary, Office of the Ombudsman, State Universities and
                   Colleges (SUCs), Government-Owned or-Controlled Corporations (GOCCs), Local

                             a.  Department of Budget and Management (DBM) for the Departments and
                                 attached agencies;
                             b.  Office of the President-Office of the Executive Secretary (OP-OES),
                                 Office of the Cabinet Secretary (OP-OCS), and DBM for the Other
                                 Executive Offices (OEOs), including the OP-attached agencies and
                                 GOCCs covered by DBM;
                             c.  Commission on Higher Education (CHED) for the SUCs;
                             d.  Governance Commission for GOCCs (GCG) for GOCCs covered by RA
                                 No. 10149;
                             e.  Local Water Utilities Administration (LWUA) for LWDs; and
                            f.   Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) for LGUs.


                   2.2    The personnel of agencies holding regular, contractual, and casual positions
                          are covered by this Circular. Excluded from the coverage herein are individuals
                          engaged without employer-employee relationship and funded from non-
                          Personnel Services (PS) budget.



           3.0 ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA

                   To be eligible for the grant of the FY 2021 PBB, each agency must satisfy the criteria
                   and conditions under the four dimensions of accountability: Performance Results,
                   Process Results, Financial Results, and Citizen/Client Satisfaction Results and
                   attain a total score of at least 70 points based on the PBB Scoring System as will be
                   discussed in detail in Section 4.0. Please refer to Annex 1. Master List of
                   Departments/Agencies

                   In the context of the FY 2021 PBB, the Performance Results refer to the
                   accomplishment of the Congress-approved performance targets under the
                   Performance-Informed Budgeting (PIB) of the FY 2021 General Appropriations Act]]></page><page Index="4"><![CDATA[(GAA). This physical target is an existing eligibility criterion for SUCs and is only
                   reinstated in the case of the national government agencies (NGAs). Process Results
                   refer to the achievements in ease of doing business/ease of transaction v\/ith the
                   agency as a result of streamlining, standardization i.e., through the ISO-certified QMS
                   or its equivalent, digitization, and related improvements in the delivery of services. This
                   is an existing criterion for NGAs and the GOCCs covered by the DBM. Financial
                   Results refer to the actual spending of the agency’s budget allotment vis-a-vis the
                   realization of the committed programs and projects based on the FY 2021 GAA. The
                   Disbursements BUR as well is a prevailing common target of all agencies. Another
                   existing criterion for all agencies, the Citizen/Client Satisfaction Results refer to the
                   achievements in satisfying the quality expectations of the transacting public.


                   For FY 2021, the GGCs shall no longer be required in determining the overall PBB
                   eligibility of the agency. Nonetheless, compliance with these conditions shall be used
                   as the basis in determining the eligibility of responsible units and individuals. See
                   Section 5.0 for details on Agency Accountabilities.



           4.0 FY 2021 PBB TARGETS, ASSESSMENT, AND SCORING SYSTEM

                   The agency accomplishments for each of the criteria shall be rated using a scale of 1
                   to 5 (where 5 is the highest). Each criterion has an assigned weight, as shown in Table
                   1. The maximum score that may be obtained by the agency is 100 points. To be eligible
                   for the FY 2021 PBB, the agency must attain a total score of at least 70 points.



                                            TABLE 1: FY 2021 PBB SCORING SYSTEM

                                                                            PERFOFUMANCE RATING

                    TOTAL SCORE                                                      MAXIMUM = 100 POINTS


                  As can be gleaned in Table 1, a performance rating of 4 in all criteria will yield a total
                   score of 80 points for the agency. To be able to attain a total score of at least 70 points,
                   the agency should aim for a performance rating of 4 in at least three (3) criteria. In
                   such case, while the agency will be eligible, the unit most responsible for the criteria
                   with a performance rating of below 4 will be isolated from the grant of the FY 2021
                   PBB.

                 4.1 Performance Results. The targets under Performance Results will enable
                       agencies to concentrate their efforts and available resources on their mandates
                       and core functions, as well as ensure delivery of high quality and high impact
                       activities.

                          a. For NGAs, GOCCs covered by the DBM, and SUCs, achieve each one of
                              the Congress-approved performance targets under the PIB of the FY 2021
                              GAA;]]></page><page Index="5"><![CDATA[b.  For GOCCs covered by RA No. 10149, achieve the physical targets
                              reflected in their approved FY 2021 Performance Scorecard and eligibility
                              requirements specified in a separate guideline to be issued by the GCG;


                          c.   For LWDs, achieve each one of the physical targets as identified by LWUA
                              in a Joint Memorandum Circular to be issued by LWUA and DBM; and,


                          d.  For LGUs, achieve the performance targets based on the Guidelines on the
                              Grant of the PBB for LGUs to be issued by the DILG and DBM.

                      The agency performance in the achievement of targets shall be closely monitored
                      through the use of the submitted Unified Reporting System (URS) - generated
                      Budget and Financial Accountability Reports (BFARs) to indicate the progress
                      towards the accomplishment of broader sectoral and societal outcomes targeted
                      by the agency for improving the lives of Filipinos.

                      The quarterly BFARs of the agencies, as uploaded in the DBM URS, shall be
                      submitted in a timely manner, i.e., within thirty (30) days after the end of each quarter,
                      as provided under Item 3.15.2 of National Budget Circular No. 583, pursuant to Section
                      90, General Provisions of Republic Act No. 11518 (FY 2021 GAA). BFARs will be used
                      to monitor and validate agency accomplishments.

                      The Performance Results shall be assessed and scored as follows:

                 4.2 Process Results. The target under Process Results is the greater ease of
                       transaction of frontline services covering all government-to-citizens (G2C),
                       government-to-businesses (G2B), and government-to-government (G2G)
                       transactions. This may be achieved through streamlining especially of frontline
                       services; standardization of frontline processes including those implemented at
                       the Regional, Satellite, and Extension Offices; digitization e.g., by developing
                       electronic or online paperless systems, new service delivery channels, contactless
                       transactions', and other process improvements for faster and more efficient public
                       service delivery.
                          a.  For departments/agencies and GOCCs covered by the DBM, the target
                              under Process Results is the greater ease of transaction of frontline
                              services covering all government-to-citizens (G2C), government-to-
                              businesses (G2B), and government-to-government (G2G) transactions.


                          b.  For SUCs, the target is to assure quality of service delivery through ISO-
                              certified QMS or its equivalent certification of frontline services.]]></page><page Index="6"><![CDATA[Agencies should report and provide the objectively verifiable evidence of their

                       perspective of the transacting public e.g., actual reduction in processing time,
                       documentary requirements, transaction costs, and other tangible improvements.
                       Agencies may use the Modified Form A to report their streamlining and digitization
                       accomplishments. The ISO-certified QMS or its equivalent certification for frontline
                       services, service delivery standards manual, and the like may be used as evidence
                       to the standardization achievements of the agency.

                          of the FY 2021 Disbursement BURs; and for SUCs likewise achieve the FY
                          2021 Disbursements BUR and the FY 2021 Earmarked Income targets.


                          Targets under Financial Results reflect final payments made from the agency’s
                          annual budget allotment to realize their committed programs and projects based
                          on the valid appropriations for FY 2021. Hence for FY 2021, agencies shall
                          accomplish the following Disbursements BUR:

                             a. Disbursements BUR is measured by the ratio of total disbursements
                                 (cash and non-cash, excluding PS) to the total obligations for MOOE and
                                 CO made in 2021, net of goods and services obligated by December 31,
                                 2020, but paid only in 2021. The total obligations for MOOE and CO
                                 shall refer to those made from the FY 2021 GAA, FY 2020 GAA, and
                                 Bayanihan II appropriations due to their extension under RA No. 115191
                                 and RA No. 115202. The objective is to measure the disbursements for
                                 the obligations for MOOE and CO made in 2021 from all valid
                                 appropriations. These shall be net of transfers to the Procurement
                                 Service (PS), the Philippine International Trading Corporation (PITC),
                                 and implementing agencies and units which have still to be implemented
                                 and outputs delivered. Hence:
                                                           Total Disbursements (cash and non-cash, excluding PS),
                                                BUR - net of payments made in 2021 for past years’ obligations
                                  Disbursements BU - Tota| obligations (excluding PS, from valid appropriations)

                                                 Where Total Disbursements is net of transfers to PS, PITC, and other
                                                 implementing agencies which have not been delivered.

                                      CITIZEN/CLIENT SATISFACTION SURVEY


                   Rationale

                   The AO 25 lATF aims to continually achieve a government-wide improvement through seamless
                   public service delivery. In achieving this, service quality standards in delivering frontline services,
                   doing business with the government, industries, various sectors, and the citizens must be
                   institutionalized across all government agencies.

                   Measuring and reporting the satisfaction level of citizens/clients that were served in FY 2021 is
                   vital in ensuring that these standards are attained. For FY 2021 PBB, agencies should report the
                  fulfillment of their services through a Citizen/Client Satisfaction Survey (CCSS) report. This
                   shall generate verifiable data and tangible evidence to assist agencies determine the
                   effectiveness of implemented ease of transaction and process improvements through identified
                   indicators or service dimensions that were identified by the agencies and the citizens/clients they
                   serve.


                   Guide in conducting the Citizen/Client Satisfaction Survey

                  Agencies are encouraged to observe the following procedures in conducting the CCSS:

                   1.  Data Gathering Methodology
                      The agency should select the data collection methodology/ies deemed as the most efficient
                      and effective way of gathering citizen/client feedback.

                  2.  Respondents Criteria
                      The set characteristic of the respondent/s must be clearly identified by the agencies to
                      properly represent the citizens/clients served for each service, and to collect accurate data.

                  3.  Survey Sampling Coverage
                      Agencies should ensure that the sampling coverage of the CCSS would best represent the
                      total population of its citizens/clients served for each service. It is important to note that the
                      sampling frame should be able to accurately capture all units in the target population to avoid
                      under coverage and/or over coverage. The total sample respondents will be compared with
                      the data on the total citizens/clients served provided by the agency for statistical comparability.

                  4.  Sampling Procedure
                      A systematic random sampling is the preferred sampling procedure. Due to budget and time
                      constraints, agencies may set a limit on the sample size of the CCSS.

                   5.  Survey Instrument/Questionnaire
                       Agencies should develop survey instruments fit for each of its services. A lean and
                       harmonized measurement tool for citizen/client satisfaction may be used. Government
                       agencies can customize their tool for relevance and effectiveness and for measuring the
                       satisfaction level and progress over time to sustain continuous organizational and service
                       delivery improvement.

                       The CCSS must capture the total citizen/client experience, expectations, and satisfaction in
                       the delivered public service with the following service quality dimensions:

                            a.  Responsiveness - the willingness to help, assist, and provide prompt service to
                               citizens/clients.

                            b.  Reliability (Quality) - the provision of what is needed and what was promised,
                               following the policy and standards, with zero to a minimal error rate.

                            c.  Access & Facilities - the convenience of location, ample amenities for comfortable
                               transactions, use of clear signages and modes of technology.

                            d.  Communication - the act of keeping citizens and clients informed in a language
                               they can easily understand, as well as listening to their feedback.

                            e.  Costs - the satisfaction with timeliness of the billing, billing process/es, preferred
                               methods of payment, reasonable payment period, value for money, the acceptable
                               range of costs, and qualitative information on the cost of each service.

                            f.  Integrity - the assurance that there is honesty, justice, fairness, and trust in each
                               service while dealing with the citizens/clients.
                            g.  Assurance - the capability of frontline staff to perform their duties, product and
                               service knowledge, understanding citizen/client needs, helpfulness, and good work
                               relationships.
                            h.  Outcome - the extent of achieving outcomes or realizing the intended benefits of
                               government services.

                       5.2  Rating Scale

                          For a deeper understanding of citizen/ciient perception of agency services, the agencies
                          may opt to include questions pertaining to the importance of attributes or agreements to
                          statements. A 5-point Likert scale is recommended to be used depending on the
                          question/s asked. Here are some sample scales:

                          Table 1:
