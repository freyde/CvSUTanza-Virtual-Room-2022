                                                                                                         99

                   unit  heads/deans  should  justify  that  the  change  would  benefit  their
                   unit/college in particular and the University in general. If a faculty member
                   pursued  a  program  authorized  by  the  University  but  which  is  not  in  line
                   with his field of specialization or not needed by his college/unit, he will be
                   required  to  transfer  to  another  college/unit  within  the  University  System
                   that needs such field of study/specialization.

                           A  scholar  who  changes  his  field  of  specialization  without  prior
                   approval  will  be  required  to  reinstate  and  refund  in  full  all  expenses
                   incurred during his scholarship to include tuition and other fees, stipend,
                   book allowance, thesis allowance, salary and other financial incentives.


                   Section 9. Leave of Absence

                          A total maximum leave of absence equivalent to one school year may
                   be granted to the faculty member or staff on scholarship upon prior request
                   based on meritorious reasons subject to the submission of an approved LOA
                   from  the  graduate  school  and  approval  of  the  University  President  upon
                   recommendation of the Scholarship Committee. The scholar on LOA shall be
                   required  to  reinstate  to  the  University  and  shall  not  be  entitled  to
                   allowances  of  a  scholar.  The  period  of  reinstatement  is  good  only  for  the
                   length  of  the  approved  LOA  unless  otherwise  approved  by  higher
                   authorities.

                   Section10. Length of Study

                          Faculty members and staff on scholarship are allowed a maximum of
                   two  (2)  years  to  finish  their  MA/MS/MBA/related  degrees  and  three  (3)
                   years to finish their Ph.D./DBA/related degrees excluding the period of their
                   approved LOA.


                   Section 11. Extension of Scholarship

                          Extension  of  scholarship  beyond  the  period  specified  in  Section  10
                   may be allowed only for five (5) months with full privileges upon certification
                   of the Adviser that the scholar can finish the course within the extension
                   period  and  the  Scholarship  Committee  has  determined  that  normal  credit
                   loads have been taken every semester. An additional extension for less than
                   or  maximum  of  five  (5)  months  only  on  official  time  and  without  stipend
                   could  be  granted  for  meritorious  reasons  and  certification  of  the  adviser
                   and/or dean of the graduate school.
