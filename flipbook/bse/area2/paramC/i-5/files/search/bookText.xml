                            engaged  in  such  work  as  research  or  other  assignments  which
                            involve work beyond their normal work load and which prevent them
                            from  taking  advantage  of  the  teacher’s  vacation  leave,  both
                            conditions  being  certified  by  the  Unit  Head  may  enjoy  cumulative
