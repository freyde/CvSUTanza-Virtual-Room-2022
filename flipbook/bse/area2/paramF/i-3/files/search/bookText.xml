                       Number Theory is concerned with the properties of the set of integers.  Through
               this, we shall discuss the set of integers that cover Euclid’s algorithm, divisibility, unique
               factorization  theorem,  and  solutions  of  congruence  residue  system.    The  course  is
               basically axiomatic in nature and will focus on proving theorems and problem solving.

                       This  text  was  primarily  prepared  to  suit  the  needs  of  students  who  are  taking
               Number  Theory.      It  emphasizes  the  essential  elements  of  arithmetic  with  special
               attention  to  those  topics  which  are  needed  in  a  college  level.    It  has  four  chapters
               which  include  the  Methods  of  Proof,  Divisibility  and  Special  Number,  Linear
               Congruence, and Linear Diophantine Equations.  These are the coverage of the 3-unit
               subject Math 105: Number Theory.

                       This text has the following features:

                       Learning Targets is the component that specifies the skills to be developed and
               serve as a guide for the learners to remain focused on the content of the instruction.
               This is written along with the introduction of the chapter.

                       Get  Ready  component  allows  learners  to  activate  their  prior  knowledge  of
               concepts and skills that will help them understand the lesson.  This is written along with
               the introduction of the chapter.

                       Self-Check is an activity which helps learners to master the basic concepts, skills,
               and processes.

                       Explore  component  engages  learners  to  investigate  numerical  aspects  of  real
               world experiences that can develop their creative and critical thinking skills.  These skills
               can  enhance  their  problem  solving  capabilities,  make  connections  for  meaningful
               learning,  communicate  and  demonstrate  understanding  of  concepts  and  skills,  and
               develop values of perseverance, hard work, cooperation, and the like in doing learning
               tasks alone or with others.

                       Practice Your Skills is one which allows learners to apply various mathematical
               concepts and skills on higher level learning tasks.

                       Summary  of  the  chapter  is  provided  at  the  end  of  each  chapter  which
               summarizes ideas resulting from exploration activities.
                       Reflection  part  provides  learners  the  opportunity  to  express  in  writing  their
               thoughts  and  feelings  about  their  learning  experiences  and  become  aware  of  their
               own mathematical thinking.  This is written at the end of each chapter.

                       Solutions  to  Exercises  (Get  Ready  and  Self-Check)  are  provided  to  give
               feedback to both teacher and students of the students’ comprehension and progress.

                       Number theory is concerned with properties of integers.  The following are some
               basic notations and properties of the integers that we will use later.

                                        DIRECT AND INDIRECT PROOF

                       Properties of integer may be proven directly or indirectly.  This lesson discusses
               the methods by which the properties are proven.  There is no exact proof that can be
               used to prove any property.


               Direct Proof
                       A method of proof showing that if the implication is true, the conclusion must be
               true  is  a  direct  proof.    Assume  that  the  proposition  is  true,  then  derive  some  facts  to
               prove that the proposition is also true.

                       If p , then  q .


                       Examples:
                              Using direct proof, prove that
                              1.  If  x  is an odd integer, then  x  3is even.
                                                      2
                              2.  If  p is even, then  p is even.
                              3.  Ifm ,n  and  k are natural numbers such that  m dividesn  and n dividesk
                                 , then m dividesk .

                       Solutions:

               Indirect Proof
                       Another technique of proof is to show something is true by showing that it cannot
               be false.  This method is known as indirect proof or proof by contradiction.   Every proof
               by  contradiction  has  the  same  form.    Assume  that  the  proposition  is  false  and  then
               derive  some  contradiction  to  known  facts  to  prove  that  the  proposition  cannot  be
               false.

                       If  q~  , then  ~  p .

                       Examples:
                              Using indirect proof, prove that
                              1.  If  x is an odd integer, then  x  3is even.
                                     2
                              2.  If  p  is an even integer, then  p is even.
                              3.  If  x   y is even, then  x and  y are of the same parity.

                       Solutions:

                                PROOF BY MATHEMATICAL INDUCTION


                       When a certain type of formula or proposition has been verified in specific cases
               but is not known to be true in general, the method of mathematical induction is often
               found extremely valuable in determining its validity.
                       Suppose that a statement involving a positive integer n is to be proved true for all
               values of n greater than or equal to a particular initial value.  We begin by showing the
               result to be true for the first value of n.  We then assume that k is some particular integral
               value of n for which the statement holds.  With this assumption as a basis, we establish
               the validity of the statement in the next succeeding case, for which n = k + 1.  In other
               words, we prove that if the statement is true for any specific integral value of n, say n =
               k, then it is also true for the next larger value of n, namely, n = k + 1.
                       Then, the second step establishes that if the statement is true for n = 1, it is also
               true for n = 1 + 1, or 2; if it is true for n = 2, it is also true for n = 2 + 1, or 3; and so on.  As a
               consequence of this, we conclude that the statement is true for all values of n greater
               than or equal to the initial value, 1.
                       We  use  mathematical  induction  to  prove  theorems  regarding  series,  divisibility,
               and inequalities.  We use the following principles in proving by mathematical induction.
               Well-Ordering Principle

                       The set of natural numbers is well-ordered with respect to the usual order, that is,
               every nonempty set of natural numbers has a least element.

               Principle of Mathematical Induction
                       Let  S be a set of natural numbers with the following properties:
                              i.  1 belongs to  S
                                       S
                              ii.  If n  , so does  n  1
                                 Then, every natural number belongs to  S .

               Parts of Mathematical Induction
                       1.  Verification – the statement is true for some initial value of n, generally n = 1.
                          This  initial  value  is  the  smallest  value  of  n  for  which  the  statement  is  to  be
                          proved true.
                       2.  Induction  Hypothesis  –  whenever  the  statement  is  true  for  some  particular
                          value of n, say for n = k, then it is true for the next larger value of n, that is, for
                          n = k + 1.
                       3.  Proof – prove that the statement is true for n = 1, n = 2, …, n = k, and all values
                          of n.
                       4.  Conclusion – if both parts of the proof have been given, then the statement is
                          true for all positive integral values of n greater than or equal to one, for which
                          the verification was made in Part 1.

               Steps in Proving by Mathematical Induction
                       The following steps are in proving by mathematical induction:

                          Step 1.  Verification.  The statement is verified for  n   3 , 2 , 1  .
                          Step 2.  Form the induction hypothesis.  We assume that the statement is true
                              for  n   k .
                          Step 3.  Proving.  Prove that the statement is true for   kn   1
                          Step 4.  Form  the  conclusion.    Since  the  statement  is  true  for n  1,  and  it  is
                                   proved to be true for  n    k   1 provided it is true for  n   k ,  thus it is
                                   true for any natural number  n .

                                     Since the statement is true for  n     3 , 2 , 1  , and it is proved to be true
                                     for   kn   1 provided it is true for  n   k , thus the statement is true for
                                     any natural number n .

               Chapter Summary

                       Number theory is concerned with properties of integers.

                       Direct  Proof  is  a  method  of  proof  showing  that  if  the  implication  is  true,  the
               conclusion must be true.  In other words, we assume that a proposition is true, and then
               we derive some facts to prove that the proposition is also true. In symbols, if p , then q .

                       Indirect Proof is a technique of proof is to show something is true by showing that
               it cannot be false.  This method is also known as proof by contradiction.   Every proof by
               contradiction has the same form.  Assume that the proposition is false and then derive
               some contradiction to known facts to prove that the proposition cannot be false.  In
               symbols, if  ~  q , then  ~  p .

                       When a certain type of formula or proposition has been verified in specific cases
               but is not known to be true in general, the method of mathematical induction is often
               found extremely valuable in determining its validity.

               Well-Ordering Principle
                       The set of natural numbers is well-ordered with respect to the usual order, that is,
               every nonempty set of natural numbers has a least element.

               Principle of Mathematical Induction
                       Let be a set of natural numbers with the following properties:
                       1.  1 belongs to
                       2.  If n  , so does  n  1
                                S
                       Then, every natural number belongs to  .

               Parts of Mathematical Induction
                   1.  Verification – the statement is true for some initial value of n, generally n = 1.  This
                       initial value is the smallest value of n for which the statement is to be proved true.
                   2.  Induction Hypothesis – whenever the statement is true for some particular value
                       of n, say for n = k, then it is true for the next larger value of n, that is, for n = k + 1.
                   3.  Proof – prove that the statement is true for n = 1, n = 2, …, n = k, and all values of
                       n.
                   4.  Conclusion – if both parts of the proof have been given, then the statement  is
                       true for all positive integral values of n greater than or equal to one, for which the
                       verification was made in Part 1.

               Steps in Proving by Mathematical Induction
               Step 1.  Verification.  The statement is verified for   n   3 , 2 , 1  .
               Step 2.  Form the induction hypothesis.  We assume that the statement is true for  n      k  .
               Step 3.  Proving.  Prove that the statement is true for   kn   1.
               Step 4.  Form the conclusion.  Since the statement is true for  n   1, and it is proved to be
                        true  for  n   k   1  provided  it  is  true  for    n   k ,  thus  it  is  true  for  any  natural
                        number.
