               ABSTRACT

               This study focused on determining the perception and acceptance of the stakeholders towards
               the  vision,  mission,  goals,  and  objectives  (VMGO)  of  Cavite  State  University  –  Tanza
               Campus. It also assessed the attainability and congruence of the VMGO to the educational
               practices and activities of the said institution. It employed a descriptive research design using
               a survey questionnaire administered using Google forms. A total of 794 internal and external
               stakeholders participated in the study using snowball sampling to reach the stakeholders via
               email and other social media sites before and during the pandemic. Data were tabulated and
               analyzed using SPSS. Results show that all the internal and external stakeholders are highly
               aware, moderately understood, and greatly accept the VMGO. Results also show that all the
               internal and external stakeholders generally perceived that the VMGO is very clear, highly
               attainable,  and  highly  relevant/congruent.  It  also  reveals  no  significant  differences  in  the
               stakeholders' responses regarding their  perception  of the awareness, understanding,  clarity,
               acceptance, attainability, and congruence to the educational practices, activities, projects, and
               operations of CvSU. Thus, it is recommended that CvSU-Tanza Campus continue the widest
               dissemination of the VMGO through various forms, conduct training for the stakeholders to
               fully understand the VMGO, and encourage the stakeholders to take part in the realization of
               the VMGO through quality instruction, research, and extension activities.

               1.0 INTRODUCTION


               Cavite  State  University  (CvSU)  envisages  being  the  premier  University  in  historic  Cavite
               (Philippines),  recognized  for  excellence  in  the  development  of  globally  competitive  and
               morally upright individuals. It articulates this vision by providing excellent, equitable, and
               relevant  educational  opportunities  in  the  arts,  sciences,  and  technology  through  quality
               instruction and responsive research and development activities. It shall produce professional,
               skilled, and morally upright individuals for global competitiveness (Cavite State University,
               2022).

               All academic units (i.e., colleges and campuses) within CvSU are required to have goals that
               align with the University's vision and mission, and all programs within an academic unit are
               required to have objectives that align with those goals.CvSU – Tanza Campus (TC), one of

                                                                                          ISSN 2583-0333

               its ten campuses, is no exemption as it aims to provide high-quality instruction to produce
               skilled, morally upright, and globally competitive graduates; develop and pursue advanced
               research activities through arts, sciences, and technology to support instruction; and develop
               and  conduct  extension  activities  that  will  empower  people  and  communities.  Hence,  its
               program offerings aim to produce graduates who can demonstrate competencies in their fields
               of  specialization  or  chosen  careers  and  with  critical  and  creative  thinking  skills,  ethical
               leadership, and morally upright values.

               CvSU  –  TC  continuously  seeks  accreditation  from  the  Accrediting  Agency  for  Chartered
               Colleges  and  Universities  in  the  Philippines  (AACCUP)  for  its  different  programs.
               Accreditation is a review procedure used to determine whether educational programs meet
               specific  quality  standards.  Accreditation  is  not permanent.  After  being  granted, it  must  be
               renewed periodically to ensure that the caliber of the educational program is maintained. It
               culminates in an external quality review by a team of professional experts from the AACCUP
               officials  and  senior  accreditors,  academic  program  specialists,  the  AACCUP  pool  of
               institutional accreditors, and international experts (Corpuz, n.d). There are ten standards/key
               result areas in all program accreditation instruments. The ultimate goal is to assess whether
               the  institution  has  achieved  its  vision,  mission,  goals,  and  objectives  (VMGO)  through
               relevant instruction, research, and extension activities.

               The efficacy of the VMGO depends on how it is disseminated and understood. To attain this,
               the stakeholders of an educational institution have to be fully aware of its VMGO and fully
               accept  its  implication  (Castillo,  2014).  Various  authors  have  assessed  the  awareness,
               acceptability, and perception of CvSU  stakeholders towards its  VMGO  (Gomez  & Basco,
               2022; Cahapin,  Malabag, Samson,  & Santiago, 2022). While these  studies  focused on  the
               awareness, acceptability, and perception of CvSU stakeholders towards its VMGO, this study
               has also assessed the stakeholders' perception of the CvSU-TC VMGO and its attainability
               and  congruence  to  educational  activities  and  practices  aside  from  the  factors  mentioned
               above.

               Perception  of  VMGO  means  how  the  stakeholders  are  aware  of  and  how  clear  they
               understand and accept the CvSU-TC VMGO. Having clarity of perception about the VMGO
               means having a clear view or understanding. Hence, if CvSU – TC stakeholders have high
               clarity of perception towards its VMGO, it is tantamount to say that the vision and mission
               statements are clearly defined, stated, and reflect what CvSU hopes to become in the future.

               On the other hand, having congruency between actual educational practices and activities and
               the VMGO means that there is a clear consensus that VMGO were clearly defined and that
               the processes and activities to achieve such are clear and in the correct order.

               In view of the preceding statements, this study was conducted to:

               1. Determine the perception of CvSU stakeholders towards its VMGO in terms of:

                   a.  awareness;
                   b.  understanding;
                   c.  clarity;

               acceptance  towards  CvSU-TC  VMGO  and  its  attainability  and  congruence  to  educational
               practices and activities.


               2.0 METHODOLOGY

               The  study  used  a  descriptive  research  method  to  determine  the  perception  and  level  of
               acceptance  of  the  CvSU  stakeholders  towards  its  VMGO.  Likewise,  the  attainability  and
               congruence  of  the  said  VMGO  to  the  educational  practices  and  activities  in  the  different
               programs of CvSU-TC were also assessed.

               A stakeholder survey questionnaire via Google forms was used to gather data from a total of
               794  stakeholders  consisting  of  91  alumna/alumnus,  79  community  members  or  extension
               clientele, 29 administrators,  faculty  members and  staff, 23 industry linkage and/or partner
               agencies,  128  parents  and/or  guardians,  and  444  students.  The  researchers  used  snowball
               sampling to reach the stakeholders during the pandemic via any possible means (i.e., email
               and/or social media sites).

               Data were tabulated and analyzed using SPSS. Descriptive statistics using weighted means
               and  standard  deviations  were used to  determine the  perception (awareness, understanding,
               clarity)  and  level  of  acceptance  of  CvSU-TC  stakeholders  towards  its  VMGO.  The  same
               statistical tools were used to determine the extent of attainability and congruence of VMGO
               to educational practices and activities. On the other hand, analysis of variance (ANOVA) was
               used to determine if there are significant differences in the stakeholders' perception and level
               of acceptance towards CvSU-TC VMGO and its attainability and congruence to educational
               practices and activities when grouped according to the nature of stakeholders.

               The following scale and interpretation were used to better understand the quantitative data:

               Table 4 shows the demographic profile of the external stakeholders in terms of age and sex.
               Most alumni (68.13%) and community members (83.54) range from 18-22 years of age. The
               majority  (84.38%)  of  the  parents  range  from  18-22  years  of  age  while  many  (73.91%)
               industry  partners  range  from  28.32  years  of  age.  All  the  female  (alumni,  parents,  and
               community  members)  respondents  dominate  the  male  (alumni,  parents,  and  community
               members) respondents. The percentage of female respondents is as follows: 60.44% alumni,
               63.28%  parents,  and  70.89%  community  members.  In  contrast,  male  industry  partners
               dominate female industry partners. 14 out of 23 (60.87%) are male.

               Overall, based on  the  results the high  number  of  students as  stakeholders  implies that the
               major clienteles of the services offered by the campus are the students.

               3.2 Stakeholders' Perception towards CvSU-TC VMGO

               Table 5 shows the level of awareness among the internal stakeholders regarding the vision,
               mission, and goals of the campus and the objectives of the different programs. The results
               revealed that the internal stakeholders, administrators/faculty/staff, and students, are highly
               aware of the VMGO of the campus. The integration of the VMGO in the course syllabi and
               the  holding  of  students'  orientation  program  every  first  semester of the academic  year  are
               some of the practices of the campus for proper information dissemination. In addition, the
               posting of the VMGO especially in the classroom makes it accessible for the students to read
               its content.


               The findings also revealed that the student stakeholders are highly aware that the "VMGO are
               displayed in bulletin boards" but moderately aware that the "VMGO are printed in brochures,
               manuals, and other materials, are broadcast in media and/or internet/website, are posted in
               social  media  sites  (Facebook,  Twitter,  etc.),  and  are  widely  disseminated  to  the  different
               agencies,  institutions, industry  sector and the  community as a  whole". The reason  for this
               may be  that  bulletin boards are everywhere  on the campus and  can be  found inside  some
               offices of the campus where students are allowed to enter.

               In addition, the administrators/faculty/staff stakeholders are highly aware that the "VMGO
               are  posted  in  social  media  sites  (Facebook,  Twitter,  etc.)"  but  moderately  aware  that  the
               "VMGO  are  displayed  in  bulletin  boards,  are  printed  in  brochures,  manuals,  and  other
               materials, and are widely disseminated to the different agencies, institutions, industry sector
               and  the  community". The reason  for this  may be  that  social  media are  more accessible to
               administrators, faculty, and staff. Although administrators and faculty members are involved
               in the formulation and revisions of VMGO and this was always integrated into the course
               syllabi, the materials and location where they are available and located may not be visible to
               them.

               Generally, the internal  stakeholders are  highly aware of CvSU's  VMGO  with the  students
               having the highest mean of 3.41.

               Table 6 shows the level of awareness among the external stakeholders on the vision, mission,
               and goals of the campus and the objectives of the different programs. The results revealed
               that the external stakeholders are highly aware of the VMGO of the campus.

               The results indicated that the  external  stakeholders are  highly aware that the "VMGO are
               displayed in bulletin boards." Bulletin boards and electronic boards are displayed in public
               places  within  the  vicinity  of  the  campus.  Alumni  and  parents  are  highly  aware  that  the
               "VMGO is printed in brochures, manuals, and other materials while community members and
               industry partners are moderately aware. All stakeholders except alumni are moderately aware
               that the "VMGO are broadcast in media and/or internet/website." All stakeholders are highly
               aware  that  the  "VMGO  are  posted  in  social  media  sites  (Facebook,  Twitter,  etc.)"  It  also
               shows that all stakeholders are moderately aware that the "VMGO are widely disseminated to
               the different agencies, institutions, industry sector and the community".

               Generally, the results indicated that  the  external  stakeholders, alumni, parents,  community
               members, and industry partners, are highly aware of the VMGO of CvSU. This may indicate
               that  the  campus  had  disseminated  the  vision  and  mission  through  various  means  that  are
               visible to them.

               The researchers also determine the extent of the understanding of the internal and external
               stakeholders in terms of the vision, mission, and goals of the campus and the objectives of the
               different  programs.  Table  7  presents  the  level  of  understanding  among  the  internal
               stakeholders  on  CvSU's  VMGO.  Generally,  the  results  showed  that  understanding  of  the
               VMGO       is   moderately    understood   by    all   the   internal   stakeholders.   The
               administrators/faculty/staff have the highest overall mean of 3.14.


               The  campus  offers  an  institutional  orientation  subject  for  all  first-year  students  which
               provides  an  opportunity  for  them  to  understand  the  VMGO  through  presentation  and
               discussion of its content. Students may know exactly the vision and mission of CvSU but do
               not  fully  understand  the  meaning  behind  all  the  statements  under  the  VMGO.  There  are
               faculty members who are given a teaching load for this subject but not all were given the
               opportunity.

               The study assessed the perception and acceptance of the different stakeholders towards the
               CvSU  –  Tanza  Campus  VMGO  and  their  attainability  and  congruences  to  educational
               practices. Based on the findings, the following conclusions are drawn:


                   1.  All the internal and external stakeholders are highly aware of the Vision and Mission
                       of  CvSU,  Goals  and  the  Objectives  of  the  different  programs  of  CvSu  –  Tanza
                       Campus.
                   2.  All the internal and external stakeholders moderately understood all the statements in
                       the   Vision and Mission of CvSU, Goals and the Objectives of the different programs
                       of CvSu – Tanza Campus.
                   3.  The  clarity  of  the  Vision  and  Mission  of  CvSU,  Goals  and  the  Objectives  of  the
                       different programs of CvSu – Tanza Campus are very clear as perceived by all the
                       internal and external stakeholders.
                   4.  The Vision and Mission of CvSU, Goals and the Objectives of the different programs
                       of CvSu  – Tanza Campus are  greatly accepted as perceived by all the internal and
                       external stakeholders.
                   5.  The Vision and Mission of CvSU, Goals and the Objectives of the different programs
                       of CvSu – Tanza Campus are highly attainable as perceived by all the internal and
                       external stakeholders.
                   6.  The Vision and Mission of CvSU, Goals and the Objectives of the different programs
                       of CvSu – Tanza Campus are highly relevant/congruent to the educational practices,
                       activities,  projects,  and  operations  of  CvSU  as  perceived  by  all  the  internal  and
                       external stakeholders.
                   7.  All the responses among the internal and external  stakeholders have  no  significant
                       difference  regarding  their  perception  on  the  awareness,  understanding,  clarity,
                       acceptance,  attainability,  and  congruence  to  the  educational  practices,  activities,
                       projects, and operations of CvSU.

               Based on the above conclusions, the following recommendations are made:

                   1.  Tanza Campus should continue its practices in the widest dissemination of the VMGO
                       through  various  forms  of  communication  media  and  ensure  that  it  is  properly
                       disseminated to all areas that can reach all the stakeholders.
                   2.  The campus should conduct a training on how the stakeholders will be able to fully
                       understand all the statements behind the VMGO.
                   3.  Activities  for instruction, research, and extension  should be  sustained  to  encourage
                       the stakeholders to take part on the realization of the VMGO.

                             ABSTRACT
                             Most teachers assume that asking questions contributes to the effectiveness of their instruction.
                             Because proper questioning techniques are important for the classroom, this study identified the
                             Mathematics pre-service teachers’ classification of test items using the revised Bloom’s Taxonomy
                             (rBT) and the Cunningham’s Levels of Questions (CLQs). It used a group of forty two pre-service
                             Mathematics teachers who were asked to classify each thinking skills in the rBT as to LOT or HOT
                             and then create test items falling under each category of the rBT and CLQ. Results revealed that
                             most of the pre-service teachers have viewed LOT and HOT based on the level of difficulty of the
                             given problem. They found it relatively easier to create test items using the Cunningham’s Levels
                             of Questions, a non-familiar nomenclature for classifying test items, rather than the well-known
                             Bloom’s  Taxonomy.  Pre-service  teachers  should  be  able  to  identify  and  classify  questions
                             according to their cognitive purposes.

                             Keywords: Revised Bloom’s Taxonomy, Cunningham’s Levels of questions, higher-order thinking

                                                       INTRODUCTION

                     Mathematics contributes directly to effective, intelligent living. Competencies with number relations are
                  essential to every individual beginning at an early age and continuing through old age. Hence, numeracy and
                  problem solving skills have been the focus of the present Mathematics instruction. However, Mathematics
                  teaching has traditionally relied on factual recall and a focus on the use of standardized algorithms with little
                  effort to teach or assess for higher-order thinking skills (Battista, 1994; Kulm, 1990) as cited by Thompson
                  (2008). As a result, students generally learn Mathematics without being able to use their knowledge to solve
                  problems in diverse or non-familiar situations. Furthermore, the result of the 2011 Trends in International
                  Math and Science Study (TIMSS) with 46 participating countries is a dismal scenario where the Philippines
                  emerged as third from the last both in Math and Science after South Africa and Morocco. Educational analysts
                  believe that the performance of the Filipino students in the TIMSS indicates danger signal which do not augur
                  well for the country’s attainment of its goals towards industrialization and economic development.
                     Unfortunately,  the  blame  for  the  said  disappointing  scenario is  always  on  the  part of  the  teachers as
                  ineffectiveness in instructional efforts results to the underachievement of students in Mathematics; and that
                  ineffective instruction is a result of being an incompetent teacher. Thus, teachers of Mathematics have been
                  spending more time and effort to find the best possible teaching strategy that could make their students learn.
                  However, evaluation of Mathematics achievement yields the same poor results, if not worse.

               According to the National Center for Education Statistics (1996), teaching for higher order thinking (HOT)
            along with professional development in HOT were found to be two of the top five variables positively associated
            with improved student achievement. Students of teachers who teach for both lower-order-thinking (LOT) and
            higher-order-thinking outperform students whose teachers only teach for LOT. Thus, Mathematics teachers
            should  have a  strong  conception  of  higher-order  thinking  and  sustain  it  as  an  integral  part  of  classroom
            instruction and assessment. With this, students will be able to meaningfully apply methods and concepts to
            situations previously unfamiliar to them. And because Bloom’s Taxonomy is a well-known model for teaching
            critical thinking skills in any subject area, it is used as a guide in creating test items.
               Also, based on the K – 12 Mathematics Curriculum Guide (2013), the twin goals of mathematics in the
            basic education levels are critical thinking and problem solving. Critical thinking, according to Scriven and
            Paul (1987) as cited in the 2013 Curriculum Guide, is the intellectually disciplined process of actively and
            skillfully conceptualizing, applying, analyzing, synthesizing, and/or evaluating information gathered from, or
            generated by, observation, experience, reflection, reasoning, or communication, as a guide to belief and action.
            On the other hand, according to Polya (1945, 1962), mathematical problem solving is finding a way around a
            difficulty, around an obstacle, and finding a solution to a problem that is unknown. These two goals are to be
            achieved with organized and rigorous curriculum content, a well-defined set of high-level skills and processes,
            desirable values and attitudes, and appropriate tools, taking into account the different contexts of Filipino
            learners.
               Critical  thinking  skills  have  become  a  generic  phase  used  to  encompass  many  processes  involved  in
            learning and problem solving. Several reasons are often given for teaching thinking skills. One reason given
            by Gough in 1997, which was affirmed by Nisbet and Schucksmith (2000), is that the world is changing rapidly
            and critical thinking skill is the most important element in today’s information age.
               Most countries like the Philippines are concerned with raising the educational standards throughout the
            compulsory  school  years.  The  Department  of  Education (DepEd  Order  No.  33,  s.  2004)  has  set  minimum
            desired learning competencies and mastery of the “basics” are exposed such as reading, writing, Mathematics
            and Science. These basics maybe excellently taught, but these are not sufficient to meet the demands of the
            labor market and active citizenship. It is now recognized that a broader range of competencies, redefined as
            higher-order thinking skills (HOTS), are required because:
               a.  The “banking theory” of knowledge based upon rote learning has been discredited as it is recognized
                  that individuals cannot “store” sufficient knowledge in their memories for future use.
               b.  Information is expanding at such a rate that individuals require transferable skills to allow them to
                  address different problems in different contexts at different times through their lives.
               c.  The  complexity  of  modern  jobs  requires  staff  who  demonstrates  comprehension  and  judgment  as
                  participants in the generation of knowledge or processes.
               d.  Modern society assumes active citizenship which requires individuals to assimilate information from
                  multiple sources, determine its veracity and make judgments.
               The cognitive skills developed by people in a society are profoundly influenced by the ways knowledge and
            literacy are taught and used. Thinking skills are viewed as crucial for educated persons to cope with a rapidly
            changing  world.  Many educators  believed  that  specific knowledge  will  not be  as  important  to  tomorrow’s
            workers and citizens as to the ability to learn and make sense of new information.
               According to Robinson (1997), if students are to function successfully in a highly technical society, then
            they must be equipped with life-long learning and thinking skills necessary to acquire and process in an ever-
            changing world. Moreover, Pascua (1991) mentioned that it is the higher-order thinking skills that enable an
            individual to learn more, to apply Mathematics in other disciplines and to solve problems throughout life.
               Bloom’s research as cited by Mergel in 1998, emphasized that in skill mastery, the teacher needs to focus
            and develop the higher-order thinking of students. There is substantial evidence that directed and controlled
            intervention  programs  can  improve  students’  abilities  to  give  more  original  and  unusual  solutions  to
            Mathematical problems of higher level.
               According to Balmaceda as cited by Laviña (2000), in the knowledge-based and technology-driven society
            of the next millennium, creativity, analytical skills, logical reasoning and critical thinking will be of paramount
            importance. These skills will be crucial in coping with the explosion of information and adapting to new and
            changing demands and challenges. The development of higher-order thinking skills (HOTS) and strategies to
            improve such has been  the focus of educators in recent years, partly in response to the challenges of the

                  emerging world. Higher-order thinking skills or what others refer to as critical thinking has emerged as a
                  priority for secondary and college curricula in most subject areas.
                     Since pre-service teachers were being developed to become successful in-service teachers, they were the
                  focus of this study. Thus, Mathematics pre-service teachers must have a strong conception of critical thinking
                  (higher-order thinking) and sustain it as an integral part of classroom instruction and assessment. With this,
                  students will be able to meaningfully apply methods and concepts to situations previously unfamiliar to them.
                  And because Bloom’s Taxonomy is a well-known model for teaching critical thinking skills in any subject area,
                  it is used as a guide in creating test items.

                                                THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK

                     Social  constructivism  is  the  primary  theoretical  framework  guiding  this  paper.  Social  constructivists
                  believe social interaction, cultural tools, and activity shape individual development and learning (Resnick,
                  1991; Tudge & Scrimsher, 2003; Wertsch, 1991). Chin (2007) stated that in the classroom “knowledge was
                  constructed through language and other semiotic means” (p. 816). If we take into consideration that much of
                  this language takes place in the form of teachers asking questions (Levin & Long, 1981), then the teachers’
                  questions are an essential part of classroom discourse.
                     Teacher’s  questions  represent  the  social  constructivist  concept  of  Scaffolding.  Scaffolding  refers  to  the
                  assistance provided by more competent peers or adults (Wood, Bruner, & Ross, 1976). Students do not explore
                  the world in isolation. Therefore, student’s learning may be facilitated by parents or teachers who are usually
                  more  knowledgeable  (Vygotsky,  1978).  During  the  classroom  discourse,  questions  can  be  used  as  a
                  psychological  tool  that  mediates  students’  knowledge  construction  (Chin,  2007),  triggers  classroom
                  interactions, and aids students in building content knowledge.
                     In 1978, Vygotsky made a major contribution to the social constructivist theory. Vyogtsky (1978) added the
                  Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) and defined ZPD as “the distance between the actual developmental
                  level as determined by independent problem solving and the level of potential development as determined
                  through problem solving under adult guidance or in collaboration with more capable peers” (p. 86). Based on
                  this theory, teacher’s questions should be neither too easy nor too difficult and new knowledge should be built
                  on student’s prior knowledge. The teacher needs to know the current developmental level of a student so that
                  the question asked is appropriate and is located in the student’s ZPD. When students interact socially within
                  their ZPD, students are more likely to discover new knowledge and bridge the new knowledge with prior
                  knowledge (Schunk, 2007). In other words asking a confused student a higher cognitive question will not help
                  the  student  with  knowledge  construction  because  the  question  is  not  in  the  student’s  ZPD.  Asking  an
                  appropriate follow-up question is more likely to facilitate connections between previous knowledge and the
                  current question. Feedback should enhance the questions teachers ask and the subject being studied and
                  should be asked in such a way that it guides student learning. Moreover, feedback must direct attention to
                  the intended learning, point out strengths and offer specific information for improvement, be timely and occur
                  during the learning, address partial understanding, and limit the corrective information to advice the student
                  can act on (Chappuis, 2009). Effective feedback is important because it is specifically related to achievement
                  no matter the grade level, race, or socioeconomic status (Bellon, Bellon, & Blank, 1991). Vygotsky’s ZPD theory
                  and the social constructivist theory provide us with a lens through which we may identify the importance of
                  follow-up questions and feedback.
                     A question is defined as an utterance that is posed in the form of an interrogation or has a grammatical
                  form which seeks to find out some information about a student’s knowledge or thinking (Chin, 2007). Socrates
                  recognized the importance of questioning as early as the fifth century BC (Ellis, 1993; Harrop & Swinson,
                  2003; Overholser, 1992). When Socrates taught he did not answer students’ questions by providing direct
                  answers (Moore & Rudd, 2002), instead he posed further questions to place the responsibility of thinking on
                  the students. This technique became known as the Socratic Method and required students to be active thinkers
                  rather than passive listeners. The Socratic Method of questioning seldom requests factual information, but
                  persuades  and  permits  students  to  express  their  opinions  and  explore  the  rationale  for  their  responses
                  (Overholser, 1992). Questioning should challenge students to think critically and creatively (Ellis, 1993; Wilen,
                  1991), stimulate student participation, arouses student interest (Wilen, 1991), identify student abilities (Ellis,
                  1993; Wilen, 1991) and misconceptions, confirm students’ understanding of the material being taught.
                     Even though the Socratic Method of questioning is a successful model and questioning is widely used in
                  the classroom, the cognitive level and the purpose of questions teachers ask indicate that classroom teachers

            possess inadequate questioning techniques. There are three reasons why questioning by classroom teachers
            is failing to meet the rigor of the Socratic Method. First, the majority of the questions teachers ask in the
            classroom  are  lower  level  questions  that  emphasize  rote  memory  and  recall  of  factual  information
            (Cunningham, 1987; Gall, 1984; Myhill & Dunkin, 2005; Wilen, 1991). A study conducted by Pate and Bremer
            (1967) revealed that most teachers regarded questioning as a means to check student understanding, diagnose
            misconceptions,  and  urge  students  to  recall  specific  facts.  Ten  percent  of  the  participants  mentioned
            generalizing and making inferences. However, teachers’ questions should go far beyond memorizing. Teachers
            should  understand  that  authentic  thoughts  are  stimulated  by  questions  that  require  making  inferences,
            drawing conclusions, and creating meaning (Elder & Paul, 1998).
               Most K-12 teachers are familiar with Bloom’s Taxonomy as a scaffold for questioning, but few have had
            substantive training in their teacher education courses that included effective questioning based on Bloom’s
            Taxonomy (Hannel, 2009). Being aware of Bloom’s Taxonomy is not enough to persuade classroom teachers to
            design  questions  based  on  the  six  levels  within  the  cognitive  domain.  Moreover,  pre-service  elementary
            mathematics teachers struggle when listening to and responding to students (Nicol, 1999). Therefore, today’s
            pre-service teacher education courses cannot focus solely on posing questions. Teacher educators must pay
            equal attention to questioning skills with regard to posing, listening, and responding to students. Because
            posing  questions  without  listening  and  responding  to  students  does  not  build  a  constructive  discussion,
            teachers  must  listen  to  students,  make  sense  of  students’  answers  and  questions,  and  identify  students’
            understanding of the questions posed in order to provide constructive feedback or ask constructive follow-up
            questions. Questioning should be a two-way interaction between teachers/students and students/students. The
            categorization of questions and the respective theorists/researchers is summarized and may be reviewed in
            Table 1.
               Bloom’s  Taxonomy  (or  its  revision),  Sander’s  Taxonomy  and  Cunningham’s  Five  Levels  of  Questions
            provide teacher educators with examples of levels of questioning. Bloom’s Taxonomy (Bloom et al., 1956) is
            the  most  popular  and  has  been  used  to  categorize  questions  into  hierarchical  cognitive  levels.  Bloom’s
            Taxonomy divides learning objectives into three domains: cognitive, affective, and psychomotor. The cognitive
            domain includes six hierarchical categories: knowledge, comprehension, application, analysis, synthesis, and
            evaluation.  Knowledge is  the  lowest  cognitive  level  and  evaluation is  considered  the  most  complex.  Each
            category of the cognitive domain is associated with specific verbs, which  may be used to phrase learning
            objectives  and  questions.  Sanders’  Taxonomy  (1966)  divides  cognition  into  seven  hierarchical  categories:
            memory, translation, interpretation, application, analysis, synthesis, and evaluation.
               Bloom’s and Sanders’ Taxonomies are based on the verbs that describe learning objectives and have been
            criticized for being too narrow to allow for an accurate measurement of each level (Riegle, 1976). Moreover,

                  Question Level   Characteristics                       Sample Question
                  1.  Factual recall   Emphasizes rote memory instead of thinking skills.  What is natural number?
                     question
                  2.  Low convergent  Requires students to put facts together and construct What are the similarities between natural
                     question     a response using comparing, contrasting,   number and integers?
                                  generalizing, transferring form, or explaining.
                  3.  High-convergent Requires students to look for evidence to support   How do you control the variables in this
                     question     answer, give reasons for behaviors or outcomes, and  experiment?
                                  draw conclusions.
                  4.  Low-divergent   Requires students to find alternative solutions.   How can we use square tiles to build a
                     question                                            different rectangle with the same perimeter?
                  5.  High-divergent  Promotes creative thinking.        How can we build the largest house with
                     question                                            limited materials?

                  Gall (1970) claimed that “a weakness of the cognitive-process approach to question classification is that these
                  processes are inferential constructs” (p.710) that cannot be directly observed.
                     Zhang and Patrick (2012) proposed the use of Cunningham’s Five Levels of Questions (1987) as a better
                  choice for observable and measurable categorizing of questions (Table  2). The lowest level of questioning
                  emphasizes rote memory and the answer to the question is predictable. The middle level of questioning is
                  convergent and is divided into low and high levels. Low-convergent questions require students to put facts
                  together  and  construct  a  response  using  comparing,  contrasting,  generalizing,  transferring  form,  or
                  explaining.  High-convergent  questions  require  students  to  look  for  evidence  to  support  the  answer,  give
                  reasons for behaviors or outcomes, and draw conclusions. However, teachers also look for specific answers at
                  this level. The highest level is composed of divergent questions that and are divided into low and high levels.
                  Divergent questions are usually open-ended. Low-divergent questions require students to find alternative
                  solutions. High-divergent questions promote creative thinking.


                                                   RESEARCH QUESTIONS
                     This study attempted to determine the classification of test items written by Mathematics pre-service
                  teachers using the revised Bloom’s Taxonomy and the Cunningham’s Level of Questions. Specifically, it aimed
                  to answer the following questions:
                     a.  What  is  the  description  of  the  Mathematics  pre-service  teachers  in  terms  of  their  academic
                        achievement?
                     b.  How do Mathematics pre-service teachers describe lower- and higher-order thinking skills?
                     c.  Which questions written by mathematics pre-service teachers were representative of:
                        •  each thinking skill in the Bloom’s Taxonomy?
                        •  each level in the Cunningham’s Taxonomy?
                     d.  Which  taxonomy  is  easier  to  use  in  preparing  test  items  as  perceived  by  mathematics  pre-service
                        teachers?

                                                       METHODOLOGY

                     The participants of the study were composed of 42 mathematics pre-service teachers (MPSTs) from two
                  selected universities in Cavite. Their GPAs in the content and professional courses that were already taken
                  were gathered. The MPSTs were asked to describe lower- and higher-order thinking. When testing for levels
                  of thinking, it is important that teachers should note the familiarity to the problem situation (Thompson,
                  2008). It is considered as HOT if the problem situation is new, unfamiliar, or in some way different from those
                  used in the instruction. Otherwise, it is deemed LOT.
                     Pre-service teachers were then asked to classify each thinking skill in Bloom’s Taxonomy as either LOT or
                  HOT. Lastly, they were asked to construct a Geometry examination item for each thinking skill in the RBT
                  and CLQ. Since the latter is not familiar with the PSTs, the researcher explained each level and provided
                  them with a handout that consists of the characteristics and examples of each question level. Once they were
                  comfortable with the CLQ, they proceeded to writing test items.

               The  researcher  classified  each  item  as  to  whether  it  fits  with  a  thinking  skill  in  BT  and  in  the
            Cunningham’s  Levels of  Questions.  Three  consultants were  asked  to  classify  and  validate each  test  item
            independent of the researcher to break disagreements on classification.

                                                     RESULTS
               Of the twenty 42 participating Mathematics pre-service teachers, seventy four percent of them indicated
            that they were either very familiar (14%) or somewhat familiar (60%) with Bloom’s Taxonomy (BT); but none
            of them indicated familiarity with Cunningham’s Levels of Questions. Some of these pre-service teachers also
            indicated that they had learned BT during their undergraduate courses as part of their curricular program.
            Others have learned it also through researches and seminars they had attended.
                Research Question No. 1: What is the Description of the Mathematics Pre-service
                               Teachers in terms of their Academic Achievement?
               MPSTs’ final grades in content and professional courses were gathered by computing their GPAs (see
            Table 3). Dominantly, student’s achievements in specialization content courses and professional education
            courses are interpreted as very satisfactory that falls under 1.76 to 2.00.
               Based on these, it is expected that each pre-service teacher is well-versed in writing test items since their
            content and professional knowledge are both very satisfactory which are both very essential to students taking
            teacher education program.
              Research Question No. 2: How do Mathematics Pre-service Teachers Describe Lower-
                                         and Higher-order Thinking Skills?

               Some pre-service teachers included as part of their characterizations of LOT or HOT the level of difficulty
            of the given problem – as to simple or complex processes involved. Several pre-service teachers wrote that LOT
            problems are easier than HOT problems – they involve logical and critical thinking as well as careful analysis
            of the given problem.
               Furthermore, a few pre-service teachers had mentioned that LOT requires simple recall of information and
            that  these  information  are  too  basic  and  based  only  on  rote  memory,  whereas,  HOT  as  mentioned  is  a
            challenging tool in teaching and learning Mathematics because it enhances the creativity of the students in
            solving  given  problems.  However,  they  fail  to  characterize  LOT  or  HOT  problems  based  on  students’
            familiarity to the given problem.
               On the other hand, pre-service teachers were asked to classify each thinking skill in the Bloom’s Taxonomy
            as either LOT or HOT. The results are presented in Table 4.
               Teachers’  classification  of  thinking  skills  indicated  that  100%  of  the  teachers  correctly  classified
            remembering as to LOT; analyzing and creating as to HOT. Over 75% of the teachers classified understanding
            correctly as LOT. Applying is considered LOT or HOT in the revised Bloom’s Taxonomy. However, about 55%
            of the teachers classified application as HOT and the rest as LOT. It is interesting to note that most of the
            teachers identified analyzing items correctly. Evaluating is the second highest level of thinking skill in BT

                   Research Question No. 3: What are the Categories of Questions Developed by the Pre-
                     service Teachers in terms of the Revised Bloom’s Taxonomy and the Cunningham’s
                                                     Level of Questions?
                     Out of 243 test items that were developed under the RBT presented in Table 5, a little more than half
                  (53.50%)  were  correctly  classified  according  to  Bloom’s  Taxonomy.  The  remembering  and  application
                  categories both received the highest percentage of correct classifications (70%) followed by understanding
                  skills (60%). Test items under creating skills had the lowest percentage (21.05%).
                     Out of 194 test items that were developed under the CLQ presented in Table 6, more than 75% were
                  correctly classified according to Cunninghams’ Level of Questions. The high convergent, low convergent and
                  high divergent questions all received a remarkable percentage of correct classifications.
                     In the analysis of test items written, it is noticeable that common higher-level items were those that will
                  require students to construct and/or criticize proofs given some conditions of the problems, without really
                  establishing their familiarity with the problem. Another is that teachers were likely to categorize as HOT
                  those items that will require students to solve complex procedures where in fact, the procedure has been taught
                  to the students before but is not implied on the problem the solution to be used. Some teachers had interpreted
                  evaluating items as “finding the value of” where in fact; test items within this category must be considered
                  application items. Several pre-service teachers commented that although the test items were familiar to the
                  students, there is still a need to analyze the problems, identify and combine theorems and postulates and their
                  relations to the condition stated in order to arrive at the conclusion. Hence, despite the pre-service teachers’
                  familiarity with the Bloom’s Taxonomy, this did not help much in the construction of the test items that are
                  appropriate to their classifications of thinking skills.
                     Surprisingly, despite that all of the MPSTs were not familiar with Cunningham’s Levels of Questions, they
                  successfully wrote test items falling in each category under this classification.

                                      Perceived by Mathematics Pre-service Teachers?

                     In classification of test items, it is interesting to note that MPSTs could develop and classify test items
                  more  correctly  in  terms  of  the  Cunninghams’  (85.57%)  rather  than  Bloom’s  Taxonomy  (53.50%).  Is  this

            indicative that MPSTs perceived the use of Cunningham’s to be easier than the Bloom’s Taxonomy? Table 7
            presents the results of t-test of difference between two proportions.
               Comparison of correct classification of test items using RBT and CLQ indicates that there is significant
            difference in the way mathematics pre-service teachers classify test items, Z = -7.978, p < 0.05. This indicates
            that  MPSTs  relatively  find  it  easier  to  write  test  items  using  Cunningham’s  Levels  of  Question,  a  new
            nomenclature for them, rather than the revised Bloom’s Taxonomy, a very quite familiar nomenclature in
            classifying test items in cognitive levels.

                                                  CONCLUSIONS
               Mathematics pre-service teachers have very satisfactory academic achievement which help them in writing
            test items. In teaching for HOT in Mathematics, pre-service teachers disregarded the concept of familiarity of
            the student to the situation presented to them. What they thought of was that LOT items were easier to
            answer and/or solve than HOT items. Most of the pre-service teachers found it difficult to construct test items
            that fit in the thinking skill described in Bloom’s Taxonomy, especially those at the evaluating and creating
            levels. Teachers also overestimate those “complex problems” and regarded them as HOT where in fact, they
            are considered as LOT. Also, they tend to underestimate those LOT items which require student to recall
            theorems and concepts without anticipating that the problems need to be analyzed in order to come up with
            such theorems. It is interesting to note that although they were not familiar with Cunningham’s Levels of
            Questions, they successfully wrote test items under each category.
               To support pre-service teachers in promoting classroom interactions through higher-level questioning, pre-
            service teachers should be aware of the types of questions that encourage higher level thinking. They should
            be able to identify and classify questions according to their cognitive purposes such as lower level knowledge
            questions and higher-level evaluation questions. And so, the researcher recommends the use of Cunningham’s
            Levels of Questions first in categorizing test items since most of the pre-service teachers could easily create
            test  items  under  this  classification.  However,  it  is  not  suggested  that  the  use  of  Bloom’s  taxonomy  be
            eliminated in the curriculum as this is essential in classifying questions in the cognitive level. They should go
            hand  in  hand  to  better  equip  pre-service  teachers  with  adequate  knowledge  in  promoting  classroom
            interactions through higher-level questioning.

                                  mathematics  achievement  of  freshman  students  taking  non-board  examination  programs  at  a  certain  state
                                  university in Southern Luzon, Philippines. In this descriptive-correlational research design, purposive sampling
                                  technique was used to select 258 participants enrolled in the subject mathematics in the Modern World. Four sets
                                  of research instruments were used for the data collection: namely, mathematics Achievement Motivation Scale,
                                  Locus of Control Scale, mathematics Study Habits Inventory and the teacher-made mathematics Achievement
                                  Test. The results showed that most students have average achievement motivation, internal locus of control,
                                  desirable  study  habits  and  average  mathematics  achievement.  The  results  also  revealed  that  there  was  a
                                  significant  relationship  between  achievement  motivation  and  mathematics  achievement  and  achievement
                                  motivation was found to be the only predictor of mathematics achievement. This indicates that achievement
                                  motivation is effective in enhancing mathematics achievement. Students’ achievement motivation will increase
                                  to high level if given the right remediation. Hence, high achievement motivation can predict high mathematics
                                  achievement.

            INTRODUCTION


               Having a solid foundation of mathematics subject is having the ability to think critically and solve problems creatively; and
            this ability is necessary for success in life. However, learning mathematics is not easy for most Filipino students as they were found
            to have difficulty in understanding mathematics lessons that require higher order thinking skills (Patena & Dinglasan, 2013). Even
            college students are not excluded from the problem in learning and mastering mathematics and this is visible in the students’ low
            performance in mathematics test (Andaya, 2014). Obiero (2018) observed that poor mathematics achievement has been a concern
            worldwide despite the actual studies that have been done on certain factors which have been recognized as possible contributors
            to mathematics achievement. Poor mathematics achievement is a learning disability and major cause of failure in school (Dela
            Cruz, 2018). So, it is necessary to identify the factors that may affect mathematics achievement of the students for the teachers
            and the administrators to find solution for improvement.
               Various researchers have explored many factors which are found responsible for success or failure in mathematics and some
            of these include achievement motivation, locus of control and study habits. On one hand, achievement motivation plays a very
            important role in the teaching and learning process (Hasan & Sarkar, 2018) as it is described as a student’s inner drive to achieve
            and if that student lacks that desire to achieve, the academic performance will be affected. On the other hand, locus of control
            plays an important role in learning motivation and in the development of a person, which could affect the achievement of students
            (Nongtdu & Bhutia, 2017). According to Choudhury and Borooah (2017), locus of control is a student’s personality and his belief in
            the causes of his success or failure in academics and can be classified as either internal or external. Students with internal locus
            of control believe that the causes of their success or failure is a result of their own efforts and abilities; while students with external
            locus of control believe that factors like luck, task difficulty or other people’s action often result to their success or failure (Gujjar
            & Aijaz, 2014). Atetwe et al. (2018) found out that an internal locus of control predicts high mathematics achievement.
               Furthermore, students’ study habits play a vital role in reflecting the standard of education and the students’ mathematics
            achievement (Odiri, 2015). According to Sharma and Vyas (2016), study habits refer to the way of exercising students’ abilities in

            the process of learning. The general belief is that students who exercise good study habits are expected to excel than those with
            bad study habits (Arora, 2016). Improving achievement motivation and study habits (Daniel, 2015) and internal locus of control
            (Atetwe et al., 2018) among students may enhance their mathematics achievement. Thus, it is important to determine whether
            these variables could predict students’ mathematics achievement so that necessary intervention programs can be recommended.
               As such, the researcher attempted to determine whether achievement  motivation, locus of control and study habits are
            predictors of mathematics achievement of college students enrolled in non-board examination programs under tourism and
            hospitality management and business management taking the subject mathematics in the Modern World during the first semester
            of the academic year 2019 - 2020 at a certain state university in Southern Luzon, Philippines. To achieve this, the following research
            questions were set:
               1.  What is the profile of the students in terms of achievement motivation, locus of control, study habits and mathematics
                  achievement?
               2.  Is there a significant relationship between student’s mathematics achievement and achievement motivation, locus of
                  control, and study habits?
               3.  To  what  extent  do  students’  achievement  motivation,  locus  of  control  and  study  habits  predict  their  mathematics
                  achievement?


            LITERATURE REVIEW


               The  importance  of  achievement  motivation,  locus  of  control  and  study  habits  in  the  teaching  and  learning  process  is
            emphasized in most studies. Each of these factors can predict mathematics achievement as seen in the results of the studies
            conducted  about  achievement  motivation,  locus  of  control  and  study  habits.  Students  were  found  to  possess  high  level  of
            achievement motivation, internal locus of control and good study habits.
            Achievement Motivation
               In a study of the way how people satisfy their needs, American psychologist David McClelland concluded that people have
            motivating drivers that are directly linked to their needs regardless of age, gender, culture and race (Mulder 2015). One of these,
            based  on  McClelland’s  Human  Motivation  Theory,  is  the  need  for  achievement  or  achievement  motivation.  Achievement
            motivation is defined by McClelland as the positive and negative effects that arose in situations involving certain standards of
            excellence where performance in such situations can be assessed as success or failure (Daniel, 2015). It is an inner drive that
            motivates  the  students  to  achieve  a  particular  goal  (Kaur,  2017).  When  students  are  motivated  to  perform  competently  on
            academic tasks, they will learn according to their abilities; hence, learning of the students is maximized when their achievement
            motivation is enhanced (Yazdani & Godbole, 2014).
            Locus of Control
               The concept of locus of control was formulated by psychologist Julian B. Rotter in 1954 and referred it as a dimension of
            personality which helps explain one’s traits and behaviors (Choudhury & Borooah, 2017). Locus of control is a variable which refers
            to an individual’s belief about the causes of the good or bad result in his or her life, either in general or in specific area such as in
            academics (Kumar & Asha, 2017). According to Curtis and Trice (2013), Rotter defined locus of control as a set of stable beliefs that
            predict performance in achievement contexts and can be conceptualized as either internal or external (Mathur, 2014). A person
            with internal locus of control believe that their ability and effort are essential for achievement and can be used to assess the causes
            of success or failure of individuals; while those with an external locus of control view luck, chance, the influence of powerful others
            (such as teachers), and the difficulty of the task as the primary factors determining success or failure. Ashton D. Trice developed
            the Academic Locus of Control Scale in 1985 specifically designed for college students and conducted a study together with
            Nicholas A. Curtis regarding its revisions in 2013. In their study, four factors were found within the Academic Locus of Control
            namely, hopelessness, distractibility, poor student attitude and impaired planning. It was suggested that seven items from the
            original scale which did not load on these four factors should be removed.
            Study Habits
               Study habits refer to the way of studying in whatever manner, whether systematic or unsystematic, efficient or otherwise
            (Sharma & Vyas, 2016). Student’s study habits differ from one another. Some study habits are considered to be more desirable
            than others from the view of academic achievement (Arora, 2016). Although variations exist among the students, there are some
            good study habits that will lead to academic achievement. Good study habits are the practices that could improve students’
            concentration, remembering, organizing time, studying, listening and taking notes, taking tests and motivation (Llavore et al.,
            (2015). Prof. M.N. Palsane and Sadhna Sharma constructed a study habit inventory composed of eight different domains. The eight
            domains of the study habits include (1) time management, (2) physical status, (3) note-taking, (4) testing strategies, (5) learning
            motivation, (6) reading ability, (7) memory and (8) health. This was the basis of the adaptation of the Study Habits questionnaire.
            Mathematics Achievement
               Academic achievement is defined as a measure of knowledge, understanding or skills in a specific subject or a group of subjects
            and can be described as a successful accomplishment in a particular subject area (Verma, 2016). Mathematics is an academic
            discipline that has a very important application in science and technology (Singh, 2015), and Charles-Ogan and Alamina (2014)]]></page><page Index="36"><![CDATA[Villa & Sebastian / INT ELECT J MATH ED, 16(3), em0661      3 / 16

            noted that having a strong background in mathematics is crucial for many careers and job opportunities in today’s technological
            society. However, despite its usefulness and importance, it is still perceived by the students as difficult, boring, abstract, and that
            achievement in mathematics requires a special ability (Daniel, 2015). Dela Cruz (2018) stated that poor academic achievement in
            mathematics is a learning disability for Filipinos and a major cause of failure in academics. Thus, it is necessary to observe the
            teaching and learning process in mathematics so that this important subject is fully presented to the students and that they may
            have a great interest and more achievements in the subject (Singh, 2015).
            Achievement Motivation and Mathematics Achievement
               Sahayarani and Stanley (2017) found out that the level of achievement motivation of the students was above average and
            showed a high positive correlation with achievement in mathematics. In addition, Sarangi (2015) determined the relationship
            between achievement motivation and academic achievement on the basis of community, locale and sex. The study revealed a
            significant relationship between achievement motivation and academic achievement in the case of non-tribal, female, and rural
            and urban students while a no significant relationship existed between tribal and male students. In contrast, the study of Hasan
            and  Sarkar  (2018)  showed  a  non-significant  correlation  between  achievement  motivation  and  academic  achievement  of  the
            students.  Furthermore,  Obiero  (2018)  found  a  positive  but  weak  and  none  significant  relationship  between  achievement
            motivation and mathematics achievement of the students.

            Locus of Control and Mathematics Achievement
               Several factors may contribute to academic achievement, but locus of control is one variable that has been overlooked and
            can be studied and reviewed as an important indicator in predicting academic success and failure of the students (Anakwe, 2018).
            Gujjar and Aijaz (2014) stated that locus is a personal belief about who can control the consequences of a student’s action, referring
            to success and failure in academics. Mathur (2014) revealed that college students with an internal locus of control can be expected
            to perform better in their academics and also have a positive attitude towards life whereas the ones with an external locus of
            control are not expected to perform well as the previous one. Raheem and Abdulkadir (2018) found that if a person with an internal
            locus of control does not perform well in a test, he would blame it on lack of preparedness on his part and if he performed well in
            a test, he would attribute this to his ability to study. On the other hand, if a person with a high external locus of control does poorly
            in a test, he might attribute this to the difficulty of the test questions and if he performed well in it, he might think the teacher was
            lenient or that he was lucky. Since the student is the one responsible for the consequence of his or her success or failure in
            academics, Nongtdu and Bhutia (2017) concluded that internal locus of control should be encouraged among students so they
            would work harder for their own progress.
               Choudhury and Borooah (2017) found no significant correlation between external locus of control and academic achievement,
            which indicates that external locus of control did not influence the academic achievement of the students. On the other hand,
            Atetwe et al. (2018) found that there was statistically significant correlation between internal locus of control and mathematics
            achievement and that high level of internal locus of control was associated with high mathematics achievement. Atetwe et al. also
            added that a variety of learning strategies should be used that would encourage students to improve their internal locus of control
            and make them realized that they have more control over their mathematics achievement and this would enable the students to
            take responsibility of their learning and have a possible high achievement in mathematics (2018).

            Study Habits and Mathematics Achievement
               Moreover, Sharma and Vyas (2016) stated that good study habits will result in good academic achievement whereas bad study
            habit will result in a poor academic achievement. Specifically, good study habits lead to better mathematics achievement and
            lack  of  good  study  habits  results  in  poor  mathematics  achievement  (Odiri,  2015).  Hence,  teachers  should  provide  ways  in
            improving the student’s study  habits by capitalizing on  the  student’s strengths and work on their weaknesses by preparing
            activities that match their cognitive abilities and time for independent learning must be used properly to increase mathematics
            achievement (Dela Cruz, 2018). However, Arora (2016) revealed that proper study habits should be taught at the early stage of the
            students and efforts should be made both by parents and the school authorities to provide suitable environment to develop good
            study habits among the students to stop academic failure. Therefore, it can be said that learning how to study or to develop good
            study habits is a lifelong process, and one should be ready to modify one’s method of study according to the need of time
            (Lawrence, 2014).
            Achievement Motivation, Study Habits and Mathematics Achievement
               Knowing the possible influences of many factors in the academic achievement of the students yet hard to identify and analyze
            all factors, Suresh (2015) conducted a study to find its influences to selected factors like achievement motivation and study habits
            of the students. It was found out that academic achievement was highly influenced by achievement motivation compared to study
            habits.  Particularly,  achievement  motivation  made  the  most  significant  contribution  to  the  prediction  of  mathematics
            achievement followed by study habits (Daniel, 2015). Yazdani and Godbole (2014) concluded in their study that achievement
            motivation  and  study  habits  and  its  eight  domains  of  time  management,  physical  status,  study  aids/note-taking,  learning
            motivation, testing strategies, reading ability, memory and health are said to be effective in helping the students gain better
            performance and academic achievement. Thus, Kaur (2017) stated that academic achievement can be improved by having proper
            achievement motivation and improving good study habits.]]></page><page Index="37"><![CDATA[4 / 16                           Villa & Sebastian / INT ELECT J MATH ED, 16(3), em0661

            METHODOLOGY


               A descriptive-correlational design was employed in this study. Three independent variables namely, achievement motivation,
            locus of control and study habits were used to determine whether they were predictors of mathematics achievement of college
            students taking non-board examination programs. A total of 258 students who were enrolled in Bachelor of Science in Tourism
            Management, Bachelor of Science in Hospitality Management and Bachelor of Science in Business Management, all of which are
            non-board examination programs were purposively selected to participate in the study. The participants were enrolled in the
            course mathematics in the Modern World during the first semester of the academic year 2019-2020 at a certain state university in
            Southern Luzon, Philippines.
               The researcher used four (4) research instruments in collecting data for the study. First, the researcher used the mathematics
            Achievement  Motivation  Scale  to  measure  the  achievement  motivation  of  the  students.  It  was  adapted  from  Achievement
            Motivation Scale by Prathibha Deo and Asha Mohan (2002) originally with a total item of 50. Some of the items were modified to
            suit the student’s achievement motivation in mathematics and 7 items were removed because they are not related to the study.
            The questionnaire used in this study consisted of 42 items covering description of the items such as academic motivation, need
            for achievement, academic challenge, achievement anxiety, importance of grades, meaningfulness of task, relevance of college
            to future goals, attitude towards education, work methods, attitude towards teachers, interpersonal relations, individual concern
            and general interests. The scale was validated by three experts in the fields of education and psychology. After validation, it was
            pilot-tested among 35 students who were not part of the population under study. It has a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.784 which is
            greater than the minimum acceptable requirement of 0.70 (George & Mallery, 2003).
               The second instrument is the Locus of Control Scale, which was used to measure the locus of control of the students. This was
            adapted from Ashton D. Trice’s Revised Academic Locus of Control Scale (2013). Some items were modified to fit the student’s
            locus of control in mathematics. The questionnaires consisted of 21 items and each item consisted of true or false responses. It
            was also pilot-tested to another group of 35 students who were not part of the population under study. The computed Cronbach’s
            alpha for the data gathered is 0.725.
               The third instrument, the mathematics Study Habits Inventory, was used to measure the study habits of the students. It was
            adapted from Study Habits Inventory by M. N. Palsane and Sadhna Sharma (1989), which was originally a 45-item test. There were
            items on study habits that were modified and others were removed because the questions were not related to the study. The final
            instrument consisted of 37 items which measured the students’ study habits in terms of time management, physical status, study
            aids/note taking, motivation, testing strategies, reading ability, memory, and health and was validated by three experts in the field
            of education and psychology. It was also pilot-tested to another set of 35 students who were not part of the population under
            study. The computed Cronbach’s alpha for the data is 0.705.
               Finally, a teacher-made test was constructed to determine the mathematics achievement of the students and was validated
            by three experts. This consisted of 40-item multiple choice type test. The coverage of the exam included topics based on the
            mathematics in the Modern World taken by the students. The topics included Patterns and Numbers in Nature, Mathematical
            Languages and Symbols, Problem Solving and Reasoning and Data Management.
               Permit to conduct the study was first secured from the Office of the Administrator of the state university. After gathering the
            total number of first year students enrolled in non-board courses, the researcher proceeded to the distribution of the four different
            questionnaires. The researcher was accompanied by a psychometrician in administering the tests for two consecutive days except
            for mathematics Achievement Test.

            RESULTS


            Student’s Profile
               Majority of the students have average achievement motivation, internal locus of control, desirable study habits and average
            mathematics achievement. The results are presented in Table 1.
               The average achievement motivation of the freshman students obtained was similar to the result of the studies conducted by
            Chetri  (2014),  Sarangi  (2015),  Roy  (2015)  and  Rani  and  Reddy (2019).  It  indicates  that  with  little  guidance  from  the  teacher,]]></page><page Index="38"><![CDATA[Villa & Sebastian / INT ELECT J MATH ED, 16(3), em0661      5 / 16

            student’s achievement motivation can be improved to high level. Hence, achievement motivation of the student can greatly
            contribute to his or her academic performance.
               First  year  students  were  found  to  have  internal  locus  of  control.  The  findings  of  the  studies  of  Gujjar  and  Aijaz  (2014),
            Mashayekhi et al. (2014) and Mohamed et al. (2018) were similar to this study which found that majority of the college students
            possessed an internal locus of control. The internal locus of control of the students is significantly associated with good academic
            performance while external locus of control is related to low academic performance (Khir et al., 2015). Thus, having an internal
            locus of control indicates that students can be expected to perform better in their academics given adequate feedbacks.
               For  students’  study  habits,  the  obtained  desirable  study  habits  were  measured  in  terms  of  the  eight  domains  of  time
            management, physical status, study aids/note taking, testing strategies, learning motivation, reading ability memory and health.
            However, in terms of each domain, only the reading ability, memory and health gained undesirable study habits. This indicates
            that students did not manifest fondness in reading or may have difficulties in understanding the meaning of some words. Students
            also found it hard to remember the reviewed materials and experienced disappointments in the outcome of the examination.
               A desirable study habit is a good study habit. Students who have good study habits are organized, keeping good notes, reading
            textbooks, listening in class, and coming to class every day (Verma, 2016). Charles-Ogan and Alamina (2014) also found out in their
            study that majority of the students have good study habits. Odiri (2015) revealed that good study habits lead to better achievement
            in mathematics.
               As for the students’ mathematics achievement, the result conforms to the statement of Kushwaha (2014) that in considering a
            group of students, a large number of students always appeared as average achievers while only few students are found to be high
            and low achievers.
            Significant Relationship between Mathematics Achievement and its Predictors
               Educators are increasingly recognizing the importance of improving students’ mathematics achievement. With this in mind,
            the researcher focused on the factors which might be influential to this achievement by conducting both the bivariate correlation
            (Table 2) and the multiple linear regressions.
               Mathematics achievement is positively influenced by a certain variable. Based on Table 6, significant correlations (p = 0.05)
            exist between the students’ mathematics achievement and its predictor, achievement motivation (r=0.205). The result of this
            study is similar to the findings of the study of Sahayarani and Stanley (2017) which revealed that there existed a significant
            relationship  between  achievement  motivation  and  mathematics  achievement.  This  implies  that  if  a  student’s  motivation  is
            improved, the mathematics achievement can also be improved. Once a student is motivated in reaching goals in life, he/she can
            achieve more success as he/she will do everything to reach this goal.
               However, locus of control and study habits had no significant relationship to the students’ mathematics achievement. This
            study contradicts the findings of the studies conducted by Atetwe et al. (2018) about locus of control and Charles-Ogan Alamina
            (2014),  and  Odiri  (2015)  about  study  habits.  The  reason  for  the  non-significance  maybe  the  difficulty  in  understanding
            mathematics lessons for some students. Although they possess an internal locus of control and desirable study habits, there is
            still a possibility to fail in the subject. The three domains of study habits in terms of reading ability, memory and health which are
            undesirable study habits of the students may also be the reason of the non-significant relationship.
               Taken altogether, these three predictors may also affect mathematics achievement. The researcher is interested in finding a
            model that would best describe a students’ mathematics achievement in terms of the predictors used. Multiple linear regressions
            were used in running the test. However, three iteration processes were done to obtain the desired results. Variables that are not
            predictors of mathematics achievement were removed for each process. Then, the test was used repeatedly to determine the most
            significant variable. Final results are presented in Table 3.
               Table 3 shows that the regression equation model with unstandardized beta value is     =  0.0622   1  +  9.6017, where    as
            the  dependent  variable  is  the  mathematics  achievement  and    1  as  the  independent  variable  is  the  score  in  achievement
            motivation. For instance, if a student’s score value in achievement motivation is 83, the expected mathematics achievement is
            14.7643.
               The result revealed that for the predictor of mathematics achievement, it can be seen that only achievement motivation
            contributed positively to the students’ mathematics achievement as evident in the beta coefficients of 0.0622 (p-value = 0.05). This
            further  means  that  for  every  unit  increase  in  the  mathematics  achievement  is  due  to  0.0622  unit  change  of  achievement
            motivation.]]></page><page Index="39"><![CDATA[6 / 16                           Villa & Sebastian / INT ELECT J MATH ED, 16(3), em0661

               The result also indicates that highly motivated students achieve higher in mathematics achievement. This conforms to the
            statement  of  Daniel  (2015)  that  the  more  the  students  are  motivated,  the  higher  is  their  mathematics  achievement.  Hence,
            mathematics achievement could further be improved if students are academically motivated.


            DISCUSSIONS

               The study explored the predictive power of student’s achievement motivation, locus of control and study habits towards their
            mathematics achievement. The findings of the study show several points of discussion.
               Achievement motivation is an inner drive that motivates the students to achieve a particular goal. With average achievement
            motivation, a little guidance from the teacher is expected to achieve and perform better in mathematics. For most students, they
            believed that their present course will help them to be successful in the future. In addition, to do better is working harder, setting
            aside  activities  other  than  studying  harder.  These  are  proof  of  the  positive  relation  between  achievement  motivation  and
            academic achievement. This further implies that if a student is motivated in reaching goals in life, he/she can achieve more success
            as he/she will do everything to reach this goal.
               Locus of control is a personal belief about who can control the consequences of a student’s action, referring to success and
            failure in academics. Students having internal locus of control are expected to perform better in their academics given adequate
            feedbacks. However, given that internal locus dominates their characteristics as college students, they enrolled in college because
            they were expected to do so. Although they would like to finish college, it was not a mere priority for them but some other matters
            in their lives. This further explains the result of this study that having internal locus of control has nothing to do with the student’s
            mathematics achievement. Success in mathematics can never be attributed to chance nor luck, neither ability nor effort, but is
            something is beyond having internal or external locus.
               For  students’  study  habits,  the  obtained  desirable  study  habits  were  measured  in  terms  of  the  eight  domains  of  time
            management, physical status, study aids/note taking, testing strategies, learning motivation, reading ability memory and health.
            However, in terms of each domain, only the reading ability, memory and health gained undesirable study habits. This indicates
            that students did not manifest fondness in reading or may have difficulties in understanding the meaning of some words. Students
            also found it hard to remember the reviewed materials and experienced disappointments in the outcome of the examination. This
            may be indicative of some intervention activities that the teacher may use to improve study habits in terms of reading ability,
            memory and health as this have been to be influential in improved mathematics performance.


            CONCLUSIONS

               Majority of the first year students have average achievement motivation, internal locus of control and desirable study habits.
            This indicates that these students have moderate motivation to achieve success and that they perceive their success or failure
            through their own efforts and abilities in studying mathematics. When a student passes or fails in the subject, he or she takes full
            responsibility of the outcomes of his or her examination. A desirable study habits means that the student knows the importance
            of  study  habits  in  his  or  her  mathematics  achievement.  In  terms  of  mathematics  achievement,  most  students  are  average
            achievers while only few students are found to be high and low achievers.
               Significant relationship existed between achievement motivation and mathematics achievement. Moreover, achievement
            motivation was found to be the sole predictor of mathematics achievement. It can be stated that achievement motivation is
            effective in enhancing mathematics achievement. The students’ motivation to achieve success will increase to high level if given
            the right remediation so as to attain high mathematics achievement. Thus, it can be concluded that a high achievement motivation
            can predict high mathematics achievement.

              Abstract: Cavite declared a province-wide dengue outbreak from the year 2015 to 2018. The study helped create maps of the
              number of cases of dengue in the 16 municipalities and 7 cities of Cavite from 2003 to 2020; determined the predictors of
              dengue cases in terms of age and sex of the patients; and predicted the dengue cases in the year 2022, 2024, and 2026. The
              dengue cases and patients' profiles from 2003 to 2020 in Cavite were obtained from the Provincial Epidemiology Surveillance
              Unit (PESU). The maps of dengue cases from 2003 to 2020 and the predicted cases of dengue in the year 2022, 2024, and 2026
              were created using ArcMap 10.4. Time series analysis was used to predict the dengue cases in Cavite in the years 2022, 2024,
              and 2026. Based on the results, the highest dengue case was recorded in Dasmarinas City, followed by Bacoor City, Imus City,
              Gen. Trias City, and TreceMartires City. In 2022, the forecasted dengue cases in Dasmarinas City are 1,995; 1,352 in Imus
              City; and 1,260 in Bacoor City. In 2024, the forecasted dengue cases in Dasmarinas City are 2,228; 1,514 in Imus CIty; and
              1,398 in Bacoor City. In 2026, the forecasted dengue cases in Dasmarinas City are 2,460; 1,676 in Imus City, and 1,537 in
              Bacoor City. Dasmarinas City, Imus City, and Bacoor City in the province of Cavite are at risk of dengue in the years 2022,
              2024, and 2026.

              1. Introduction
                 Cavite  declared  a  province-wide  dengue  outbreak  from  the  year  2015  to  2018.  There  were  12,007  dengue
              cases, of which 48 cases of deaths were reported in 2015; 5,121 cases with 25 deaths in 2016, and 6,129 cases
              with  27  deaths in  the  upland and  lowland  part  of  the  province  in  2017. These recorded  cases  of  fatalities and
              outbreaks  post  an  alarm  to  the  whole  province  (Giron.A.2018).  Provincial  Epidemiology  Surveillance  Unit
              (PESU) announced that Cavite province has increased dengue cases up to 79 percent from January to June 2017
              up to January to June 2018 (Pino.G.2018). Outbreaks were recorded at General Trias City, Bacoor City, Imus
              City,  Dasmarinas  City,  and  TreceMartires  City  (Provincial  Epidemiology  Surveillance  Unit.2018).  The
              breakdown of these dengue cases are as follows: Bacoor City  with 305 cases, Gen. Trias City  with 303 cases,
              Imus City with 278 cases, Naic with 225 cases, Dasmariñas City with 192 cases, Tanza with 176 cases, Rosario
              with 140 cases, Silang with 137 cases, TreceMartires City with 130 cases and Noveleta with 109 cases (UNTV
              News and Rescue.2018). The numbers were confirmed by Dr. Nelson Soriano, the provincial epidemiologist.
                 Furthermore, there were five cases of death and 1,499 dengue cases from January 1 to March 11, 2018; the five
              cases  of  fatality  aged  between  4  to  23  years  old  (Cinco.M.2018).  Dengue  cases  in  the  Philippines  have  been
              confirmed nationally and occur year-round in the country, with its peak transmission during the rainy season, May
              to  November  (International  Association  for  Medical  Assistance  to  Travellers.2018).  The  World  Health
              Organization (WHO) reported that 20,108 dengue cases had been registered nationwide from January to March
              2018,  which  is  26  percent  lower  compared  to  the  same  period  where  27,023  cases  have  been  reported
              (WHO.2018).  In  the  Philippines,  which  ranks  fourth  in  the  most  dengue  cases  in  Southeast  Asia,  dengue  is
              considered one of the eight pervasive infectious diseases. Dengue can affect the country's economy because of the
              loss  of  production  caused  by  illness  and  premature  deaths.  The  increase  in  healthcare  costs  contributes  to  an
              additional burden to humans (Edilllo.F. et al.,2015).
              2.Significance Of The Study

                 The prediction and spatial distribution of the epidemiology of dengue in Cavite provides a holistic view of how
              dengue can spread in the province. This study also provides a warning to the whole province to prevent possible
              outbreaks of dengue. This can alarm the government officials and make people more aware of what will happen if
              there  is an  outbreak.  Furthermore,  the results  of  this  study  can  be  a  basis  for  the  countermeasures  on how  to
              prevent such a disaster. The data from this study can also serve as a baseline for future researchers.
              3.Review Of Related Studies
                 A high incidence of dengue has been recorded around the world. 2.5 billion people of the world’s population
              are now at risk of dengue (Palaniyandi.M. et al.,2018). Dengue has become a major international public health





                                                                                                        364]]></page><page Index="51"><![CDATA[Turkish Journal of Computer and Mathematics Education              Vol.13 No.01 (2022), 364-371
                                                                                           Research Article


              concern these past few years, and dengue hemorrhagic fever affects Asian countries. This causes hospitalization
              and  death,  where  most  victims  are  children  (Bhandari.K.  at  al.,2008).  According  to  the  World  Health
              Organization, there  may  be  50  million  cases  of  dengue  infection  worldwide  every  year.  The  global  burden  of
              dengue is difficult and represents a growing challenge to public health officials (Bhatt.S. et al.,2013). The virus is
              transmitted to humans through the bites of an infected female Aedes mosquito, which mainly acquires the virus
              while feeding on an infected host. The symptoms of dengue fever include severe joint and muscle pain, swollen
              lymph nodes, headache, fever, exhaustion, and rash. Dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) is a specific syndrome that
              significantly  affects  children  under  10.  The  complication  of  dengue  causes  abdominal  pain,  hemorrhage,
              circulatory collapse, and death if not immediately cured (Cunha.J. & Stoppler.M.2018).

                 Except for the extreme cold, mosquitoes can live in any environment, favoring forests, marshes, tall grasses
              and  weeds,  and  ground  that  is  wet  at  least  part  of  the  year  (Mosquito  World.2018).  Environmental  factors
              significantly  affect  the  breeding  and  development  of  Aedes  mosquitoes  because  they  are  sensitive  to
              environmental  conditions.  Temperature,  precipitation,  and  humidity  are  critical  to  a  mosquito's  survival,
              reproduction,  and  development  and  influence  its  presence  and  abundance.  Climate  and  environmental  factors
              significantly  affect  the  abundance  of  mosquitoes  in  an  area,  especially  in  the  countries  where  transmissions
              routinely occur with short-term changes in weather, temperature, precipitation (Center for Disease Control and
              Prevention.2012).  Mapping  the  distribution  of  dengue  outbreaks  in  an  area  is  possible  with  Geographical
              Information  System  (GIS),  which  can  provide  visual  identification  and  faster  mobilization  of  resources
              (Duncombe.J. et al.,2012). GIS and spatial analysis are powerful tools that help describe epidemiological patterns
              and detect, explain, and predict diseases in space and time (Adriana.T. et al.,2016). A graphical analysis of the
              area  can  be  provided  because  GIS  can  capture  spatial  distribution  and  the  severity  of  the  distribution  of  the
              disease.  It  can  identify  the  trends  and  patterns  to  indicate  the  affected  area  (Ai-leen.G.  &  Song.R.2000).
              Geographic Information System is recognized as an analytic tool for public health because it can identify the areas
              where  outbreaks  originate  and  effectively  target  high-risk  of  different  diseases  for  early  prevention  (Er.A.  et
              al.,2010).

              4.Objectives Of The Study
                    Determine the number of cases of dengue in the 16 municipalities and 7 cities of Cavite from 2003 to
                     2020
                    Identify the predictors in the prevalence of dengue in terms of age and sex
                    Predict and map the areas at risk of dengue in the years 2022, 2024, and 2026

              5.Hypotheses Of The Study
                    Age and sex are not predictors of dengue prevalence in Cavite, Philippines
              6.Study Area

                 The study area is the whole province of Cavite. It is located on the southern shores of Manila Bay in Luzon
              Island.
              6.1.Statistical Techniques Used in the Present Study
                 Dengue Predictors. Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to determine whether the patients'
              demographic profile (age and sex) can be predictors of dengue prevalence in Cavite. PASW Statistic 18 was used
              to perform the modeling. The dengue cases from 2003 to 2020 and demographic profile of dengue patients in
              Cavite were obtained from the Provincial Epidemiology and Surveillance Unit (PESU). The maps of dengue cases
              per year were generated using ArcMap 10.4.
                 Time Series Analysis. The researchers employed forecasting to predict the number of cases in the succeeding
              years, which required dependent (dengue cases from 2003 to 2020). The forecasted data was presented through
              Expert  and  ARIMA  modelers  in  PASW  Statistic  18  software.  The  maps  of  predicted  dengue  cases  will  be
              generated using ArcMap 10.4.

                 The city of Dasmariñas recorded 200 dengue cases in 2009, and the City of Bacoor recorded more than 100
              cases in 2008. A low number of dengue cases were recorded in the other cities and municipalities from 2003 to
              2009. From 2010 to 2011, dengue cases in Dasmariñas City ballooned to 800 cases. Furthermore, the epidemic
              increased  to more than  1,300  dengue  cases  in the  City  of  Bacoor  in  2012 and more than 1000  cases  in  2013.
              However, the number of cases suddenly fluctuated in 2014 with more than 400 cases recorded each in the cities of
              Imus, Bacoor, and Dasmariñas.
                 The increasing number of dengue cases from 2003 to 2020 is seen in the changes of colors on the maps (Figure
              1). The dengue cases from 2003 to 2020 have a gradual increase. From 2003, it increased 3.8 times until 2007, and
              it continued to increase until 2012 with 34 times the number of dengue cases from 2003. Moreover, the gradual
              increase of dengue cases continued until 2018, and it rose again in 2019 in 12 cities and municipalities in Cavite,
              having 400 cases above. Furthermore, there is a notable decrease in dengue cases in Cavite in 2020, whereas the
              people have limited movement due to Covid-19 community quarantine restrictions.
                 Dengue is considered one of the eight pervasive infectious diseases, and the Philippines ranked fourth in the
              highest number of cases in Southeast Asia. Moreover, Cavite declared a province-wide dengue outbreak because
              of the increasing number of dengue cases from the year 2015 to 2018 (Giron, A. 2018).

              Predictors of Dengue Cases
                 Table 1 shows that among the age and sex of dengue patients, only the sex is the predictor of dengue cases in
              Cavite. Most of the dengue patients in Cavite were male. In the case of India, most of the dengue patients were
              male, and it has been attributed to their frequent outdoor activities compared to females. Thus, males have higher
              chances of getting bitten by mosquitoes (Antony and Celine, 2014)

              the cities and municipalities of the province have an increasing trend of dengue cases from 2022 to 2026. For
              2022, 2024, and 2026, there are 15 cities and municipalities predicted to have 0-400 cases from 2020 to 2026. It
              has also been predicted that Silang, Trece Martires City, Bacoor City, Imus City, Gen. Trias City, and Dasmariñas
              City  will  have  800  and  above  dengue  cases  from  2020  to  2026.  Moreover,  Dasmariñas  City  was  on  the  top,
              predicted to have more than 2,001 cases of dengue in the years 2024 and 2026.

                 The continuous development of the province causes these results. The National Competitive Council of the
              Philippines ranked Cavite as second in economic competencies among all provinces (Pronove,M.2017). Cavite is
              one of the fastest-growing provinces in the Philippines. It is due to several reasons such as the availability of jobs,
              proximity to Manila, getaway destination like Tagaytay, Batangas, and other places not as easily accessible if you
              are not coming from Manila (Remo,A. 2017).
              Maps of Dengue Prevalence in Cavite
                 ArcMap 10.4 was used to generate maps of dengue prevalence in the province of Cavite for the succeeding
              years. There were three points of prediction that were set: 2022, 2024, and 2026. Most of the entry points of the
              disease in the province were located in lowland areas of Cavite (Figures 2-4).

                 The  predicted  number  of  cases  and  at-risk  areas  identified  in  this  study  could  serve  as  a  basis  for  further
                 research  and  decision-making  processes  by  the  local  government  and  other  concerned  institutions.  We

                    Evaluate the surveillance system of the province of Cavite.
                    Examine  other  possible  predictors  such  as  climatic  factors,  population  density,  and  topographic
              characteristics.
                     Create  a  more  comprehensive  baseline  database  that  will  serve  as  a  basis  for  formulating  policy
              interventions and health measures to prevent the transmission of the disease.
                    Conduct the same study on other mosquito-vectored diseases such as Malaria and Chikungunya.
              8. Conclusion
                 Analysis of the secondary data obtained from the Provincial Epidemiology Surveillance Unit (PESU) of Cavite
              showed an increasing number of dengue cases since 2010, with the city of Dasmariñas having the highest number
              of cases that prompted the local government to declare a province-wide dengue outbreak from 2015 to 2018 to
              address  the  epidemic.  However,  the  data  showed  that  there  had  been  a  decrease  in  recorded  cases  during  the
              pandemic, which could impact the quarantine protocols set up by the government. Results of regression analysis
              showed that sex was the only predictor of dengue cases in Cavite, as confirmed by the higher number of male
              dengue patients since 2003. Based on these data, the forecast showed a continuous increase of cases in the coming
              years and high prevalence in specific areas affected mainly by development such as Silang, TreceMartires City,
              Bacoor City, Imus City, General Trias City, and Dasmariñas City.

                            Abstract

                            The  COVID-19  outbreak  greatly  affected  the  education  sector.  Various
                            alternative learning activities were considered by the tertiary education including
                            the synchronous and asynchronous mode of online learning. The result of this
                            study determined the perception of learners about alternative learning activities
                            used in the virtual learning environment. Moreover, the performance of students
                            in face to face and asynchronous learning activities were compared and tested for
                            significant difference. It was found out that students who were taught with face

                            to  face  learning  modality  has  significantly  higher  academic  performance  than
                            those students who were taught with alternative learning modality but alternative
                            learning  mode  could  still  be  used  to  further  the  learning  during  this  time  of
                            pandemic.

               Introduction


               The  coronavirus  COVID-19  outbreak  disrupted  life  around  the  globe  in  2020  and  has  profound  effects  and
               impacts on almost all sectors in the  human race (Gonzalez et al., 2020). These have resulted in  widespread
               disruption including closure of schools (Viner et al., 2020).  As the world transitions to a new normal, there
               have been calls for substantial improvements in processes to facilitate safe, effective and ethical care in the post-
               COVID era (Mitchell & Nou, 2020).  Enhanced community quarantine has been enforced in the Philippines in

               response to the growing spread of the novel coronavirus outbreak (Ravelo, 2020). Responses like community
               lockdown and community quarantine of several countries have led students and teachers to study and work from
               home which led to the delivery of online learning platforms (Angelova, 2020 ; Crawford et al., 2020; Ghazi-
               Saidi et al., 2020; Hebebci, Bertiz, & Alan, 2020; Niemi, & Kousa, 2020; Sahin & Shelley, 2020).  Commission
               on Higher Education (CHED) Chairman Prospero de Vera III said that flexible learning shall be implemented
               this year. He added that universities and colleges have the freedom to choose what mode would be effective for
               them (Magsambol, 2020). The mode of learning can be synchronous, asynchronous, or both.


               Several  studies  have  been  conducted  to  determine  the  difference  in  the  use  of  face  to  face  learning  and
               distance/online learning.  Bali and Liu (2018) found that face-to-face learning perception was higher than online




                                                           140]]></page><page Index="60"><![CDATA[International Journal of Studies in Education and Science (IJSES)


               learning  in  terms  of  social  presence,  social  interaction,  and  satisfaction.  However,  there  is  no  statistically
               significant difference in learning preference found among level of student. The study also showed that some
               students were very comfortable in online learning since it led them to the chance of being innovative by using

               computer technology.  In another study by  Arias, Swinton, &  Anderson (2018), students in the face to face
               section have statistically significant higher exam scores and statistically significantly greater improvement on
               the post-test instructor questions. There is no statistical difference in the improvement on the post-test overall
               nor in the improvement in the post-test standardized questions.

               These mixed results suggest that both course objectives and mechanisms used to assess the relative effectiveness
               of the two modes of education may play an important part in determining the relative effectiveness of alternative

               delivery methods. Hence, this study determined the perception of learners about alternative learning activities
               used in virtual learning environment as well as if it facilitate or hinder the learning process. The result of the
               study  provided  a  glimpse  of  perspective  if  alternative  learning  activities  can  be  used  as  a  paradigm  shift  in
               teaching and learning process in the new normal.

               Moreover, the students‟ academic performance during face to face and asynchronous learning activities was also

               compared to support the affectivity of the learning experiences. Furthermore, this study can help educational
               leaders and curriculum managers decide in considering which learning modality better facilitate learning in the
               new normal. On the other hand, students may also gain broader understanding of alternative learning activities
               as a paradigm shift in the teaching and learning process. Likewise, future researchers may gain benefit in this
               study. The results of the study suggest new information which is useful as a basis for future studies.


               Literature Review

               The  works  of  the  professional  researchers  helped  the  present  researchers  gain  idea  regarding  the  students‟
               perception in online and face to face learning activities. It also helped determine the difference between the

               academic performances of students in face to face learning activities from asynchronous learning activities. In
               addition, the previous studies provided information regarding the pandemic and its effect in the education sector
               including information about synchronous and asynchronous learning arrangement.

               Rise of COVID-19

               The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic as the confirmed cases rise around the

               world (Ducharme, 2020). This started in China and is caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2, previously
               known as 2019-nCoV) and has received global attention from growing infections and on how to eradicate the
               disease and flatten the curve of infections (Guo et al., 2020). Symptoms include fever, fatigue, cough, lack of
               appetite, body aches, shortness of breath, and phlegm which can be transferred when the infected person coughs
               or sneezes. They can spray droplets as far as 6 feet away. If you breathe them in or swallow them, the virus can
               get into your body (Pathak, 2020). Though it affects people of all ages, it is most vulnerable to adults, children

               and people with underlying medical conditions (WHO, 2020).

               disruption  such  as  travel  restrictions  (Chinazzi  et  al.,  2020),  closure  of  schools  (Viner  et  al.,  2020),  global

               economic recession (Fernandes, 2020), political conflicts (Barrios & Hochberg, 2020), racism (Habibi et al.,
               2020), and misinformation and controversies (Enitan et al., 2020), to name a few.

               As the world transitions to a new normal, there have been calls for substantial improvements in processes to
               facilitate safe, effective and ethical care in the post-COVID era (Mitchell & Nou, 2020).  Enhanced community
               quarantine  has  been  enforced  in  the  Philippines  in  response  to  the  growing  spread  of  the  novel  coronavirus
               outbreak (Ravelo, 2020). The education sector is highly affected (Tria, 2020). Most countries around the world

               have temporarily closed educational institutions to contain the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic and reduce
               infections. This closure has affected more than 1.2 billion learners worldwide with more than 28 million learners
               in the Philippines (UNESCO, 2020). Responses like community lockdown and community quarantine of several
               countries  have  led  students  and  teachers  to  study  and  work  from  home  which  led  to  the  delivery  of  online
               learning platforms (Crawford et al., 2020).


               Education in the New Normal

               To  respond  to  the  needs  of  learners,  especially  of  the  3.5  million  tertiary-level  students  enrolled  in
               approximately  2,400  Higher  Education  Institutions  (HEIs),  certain  HEIs  in  the  country  have  implemented
               proactive policies for the continuance of education despite the closure. These policies include modified forms of
               online learning that aim to facilitate student learning activities (Joaquin et al., 2020). Online learning might be in
               terms of synchronous, real-time lectures and time-based outcomes assessments, or asynchronous, delayed-time

               activities, like pre-recorded video lectures and time-independent assessments (Oztok et al., 2013).

               Commission on Higher Education (CHED) Chairman Prospero de Vera III said that flexible learning will be
               implemented this year. He added that universities and colleges have the freedom to choose what mode would be
               effective for them. Some of them would be using pure online, pure modular, while others are combination of the
               two (Magsambol, 2020).


               In flexible learning, students gain access and flexibility with regard to at least one of the following dimensions:
               time, place, pace, learning style, content assessment or learning path (Muller et al., 2019).  It focuses on the
               design  and  delivery  of  programs,  courses,  and  learning  interventions  that  address  learners‟  unique  needs  in
               terms of the given dimensions. It does not necessarily require connectivity (Cervantes, 2020). Further, it aims to
               decongest the classroom to reduce the number of students who go there at one time so that distancing and the
               health of the students can be protected (San Juan, 2020).


               Asynchronous and Synchronous Learning

               Asynchronous  learning  means  that  there  is  no  set  time  for  the  learning  to  be  occurring.  Learners  can  learn




                                                           142]]></page><page Index="62"><![CDATA[International Journal of Studies in Education and Science (IJSES)


               anywhere and can consume their time to gain knowledge of what they want to  know and when they need to
               know. On the other hand, synchronous learning is related to structure and time-bounded activities, which are
               offered  through  web  conferencing  and  chatting  options  (Malik  et  al.,  2017).  Further,  asynchronous  learning

               makes it possible for learners to log on to an e-learning environment at any time and download documents or
               send  messages  to  teachers  or  peers.  Students  may  spend  more  time  refining  their  contributions,  which  are
               generally considered more thoughtful compared to synchronous communication (Hrastinski, 2008).

               Asynchronous Learning and Face to Face Learning

               The biggest opportunity that face to face learning presents is the ability to discuss, collaborate, practice, and role

               play, all live and with guidance from a facilitator on hand. Being part of a group and being held accountable are
               powerful  learning  tools.  Meanwhile,  asynchronous  learning  is  self-paced,  accommodates  a  busy  schedule,
               allows people to learn at their own pace, provides consistent instruction to very large audience groups and is
               available for review (Malamed, 2011). Furthermore, the  biggest differences between  online and face to face
               learning  have  always  been  in  the  realm  of  fostering  connection  and  collaboration  between  learners.  The
               importance of face to face interaction in education is vital. Social interaction has a richness that might feel hard

               to replicate in the digital world. However, it is not impossible in the corporate world (Cooke, 2020).

               Students’ Performance in Face to Face Learning and Online Learning

               According to a study by Bali and Liu (2018), face to face learning perception was higher than online learning in
               terms  of  social  presence,  social  interaction,  and  satisfaction.  However,  there  is  no  statistically  significant
               difference in learning preference found among level of student. The study also showed that some students were

               very  comfortable  in  online  learning  since  it  led  them  to  the  chance  of  being  innovative  by  using  computer
               technology.

               With  regards  to  students‟  performance,  students  in  online  courses  do  as  well  in  objective  measure  of
               performance,  but  not  better  than  students  in  face  to  face  courses.  According  to  Allen  and  Seaman  (2006),
               students need more discipline to succeed in online courses. Lack of self-discipline would have a more severe

               impact on student performance in, especially asynchronous, online courses where students are often attracted by
               appeal of anytime, anywhere structure of the course which is somewhat inconsistent with the previous finding
               that online students and traditional students performed equally well (Daymont & Blau, 2008).

               In another study by Arias, Swinton, & Anderson (2018), students in the face to face section have statistically
               significant  higher  exam  scores  and  statistically  significantly  greater  improvement  on  the  post-test  instructor
               questions. There is no statistical difference in the improvement on the post-test overall nor in the improvement

               in the post-test standardized questions. These mixed results suggest that both course objectives and mechanisms
               used  to  assess  the  relative  effectiveness  of  the  two  modes  of  education  may  play  an  important  part  in
               determining the relative effectiveness of alternative delivery methods.

               Blended Learning

               According to  Alammary, Sheard, and Carbone (2014), the term blended learning has no single agreed  upon

               definition. Although this might appear to be an academic point, the consequence is that it allows teachers and
               course  designers  to  develop  their  own  understandings  of  the  term  within  the  context  of  their  courses  or
               institutions,  and  then  use  that  as  a  basis  to  design  their  blended  courses.  In  2002,  Driscoll  identified  four
               different concepts denoted by blended learning: (1) To combine or mix modes of web-based technology (e.g.,
               live  virtual  classroom,  self-paced  instruction,  collaborative  learning,  streaming  video,  audio,  and  text)  to
               accomplish  an  educational  goal;  (2)  To  combine  various  pedagogical  approaches  (e.g.,  constructivism,
               behaviorism, cognitivism) to produce an optimal learning outcome with or without instructional technology. (3)

               To combine any form of instructional technology (e.g., videotape, CD-ROM,  web-based training,  film)  with
               face to face instructor-led learning.

               Drawing  on  the  Driscoll  (2002)  work,  Oliver  and  Trigwell  (2005)  proposed  three  different  definitions  of
               blended  learning:  (1)  The  combination  of  media  and  tools  employed  in  an  e-learning  environment;  (2)  The
               combination of a number of pedagogic approaches, irrespective of the learning technology used; and (3) The

               integrated combination of traditional learning with web-based online approaches.

               Theoretical Framework

               As  seen  in  Figure  1,  the  model  shows  which  pedagogical  objectives  and  activities  drive  the  approaches,
               including the online technology that faculty members use in instruction. The model also suggests that blending
               the objectives, activities, and approaches within multiple modalities might be most effective for, and appeal to, a

               wide range of students. The most important feature of this model is that pedagogy drives the approaches that
               will work best to support student learning.

               In the rise of the pandemic, alternative learning systems have been necessary. This included the utilization of the
               online learning system which can be conducted synchronously or asynchronously. On the other hand, blended
               learning as defined by Oliver and Trigwell (2005) is the combination of a number of pedagogic approaches,

               irrespective of the learning technology used. Moreover, blended learning can be utilized in the said alternative
               learning system as long as it combines various pedagogical approaches to produce an optimal learning outcome
               with or without instructional technology.

               Research Questions

               Generally, this study aimed to determine if alternative learning activities can be used as a paradigm shift in the

               teaching and learning process in the new normal.  Specifically, it sought to answer the following:
                   1.  What  perceptions  do  learners  have  about  alternative  learning  activities  used  in  virtual  learning
                       environment?
                   2.  Do alternative learning activities facilitate learning or hinder the process?
                   3.  Can alternative learning activities be used as a paradigm shift in the teaching and learning process in
                       the new normal?


               Method
               Research Design


               This study is a descriptive-correlation research investigating alternative learning activities – synchronous and
               asynchronous mode of learning as a paradigm shift in the teaching and learning process in the new normal. The
               significant  difference  in  the  students‟  academic  performance  during  face  to  face  and  asynchronous  learning
               activities was also determined.

               Sampling and Participants


               The  participants  of  the  study  were  teacher  education  students  in  a  state  university  who  took  Child  and
               Adolescent Learners and Learning Principles course under the same instructor. The first group of students took
               the course under the online modality which utilizes the asynchronous learning mode during the conduct of the
               study; while the second group took the course under the face to face learning modality.  Students were selected
               purposively.


               Instruments

               The instruments used by the researcher are the data gathered from the students‟ Senior High School Form 138
               from  the  university  registrar,  the  students‟  final  grade  in  the  course,  Child  and  Adolescent  Learners  and
               Learning  Principles  from  their  instructor,  and  the  responses  of  the  teacher  education  students  in  the  survey
               questionnaire which determined their perception towards the use alternative learning activities in virtual learning

               environment.

               Data Gathering and Procedure

               Students‟ grades during their Senior High School were obtained from their Form 138 submitted to the Office of

               the University Registrar.  Permission was sought first prior to actual data gathering.  This was to establish a
               point of comparison among the two groups of students.  Then, the participants were asked to respond in a survey
               questionnaire  to  determine  their  perception  towards  alternative  learning  activities  used  in  virtual  learning
               environment.

               The  questionnaire  consists  of  three  parts.  The  first  part  is  the  personal  information  which  determined  the
               student‟s  email  address,  age,  sex,  civil  status,  and  how  they  support  their  studies.  The  second  part  of  the

               questionnaire is composed of five questions regarding their familiarity and experiences on synchronous teaching
               and learning process. This includes multiple-choice type questions, check boxes, and supply-type questions.

               The third part of the questionnaire is composed of six questions regarding their familiarity and experiences on
               asynchronous  teaching  and  learning  process.  A  final  question  on  which  mode  better  facilitates  teaching  and
               learning  is  also  included.  Their  final  grades  in  the  course  were  obtained  from  the  teacher  who  handled  the

               course.

               Data Analysis

               Two groups of college students were the focus of this study.  The first group, controlled group, was graduates of
               senior high school and were taught using face-to-face interaction in the normal classroom setup and enrolled in a
               certain state university under the teacher education program during the First Semester, AY 2019 – 2020. The

               second group  was graduates  of SHS  in the  new  normal and enrolled in the  same  university  under the same
               program during the First Semester of the following year.

               Demographic  profiles  were  collected  among  these  participants.  Also,  their  perceptions  towards  alternative
               learning activities were sought. These were done through an online survey via Google forms that were sent to
               the participants. These two  groups  were also compared in terms of their academic performance. In order to

               establish some point of comparison for the said two groups, it was necessary to determine if there exists no
               significant difference in their academic performance prior to admission to college. In this regard, independent
               samples t-test was used to accomplish the task.

               Once no significant difference has been established in the two groups, their final grades were compared and
               tested for significant differences to determine whether the use of alternative learning activities will have the
               same effect to student‟s academic performance when they were taught using face-to-face classroom setup.  Also,

               Cohen‟s  d  was  used  to  describe  the  effect  size  on  the  teaching  methodology  used.  Table  1  shows  the
               transmutation of midterm grades.

               Ethical Considerations

               Informed consent from the campus administrator, department chair, registrar, and students were obtained using
               relevant  documentation  before  the  conduct  of  the  study.  This  includes  a  letter  of  request  addressed  to  the
               campus administrator, department chair, and registrar. To protect their basic rights, privacy, and confidentiality,
               all direct identifiers were removed. All participants were given fictive names as well as the instructor of the

               course. This is an important step that none of the participants will be recognizable. All the gathered data were
               treated with utmost confidentiality and was used solely for the completion of the study.

               Students’ Perception towards Alternative Learning Activities

               Students  were  asked  about  their  familiarity  of  alternative  learning  activities  in  terms  of  synchronous  and
               asynchronous teaching and learning activities.  Results are presented in Table 3.  In terms of familiarity with
               synchronous learning activities, 42.42% are very familiar, 51.52% are familiar, 3.03% are somewhat familiar,
               and  3.03%  are  not  familiar.    On  the  other  hand,  48.48%  are  very  familiar,  48.48%  are  familiar,  3.03%  are

               somewhat familiar, and 0 are not familiar with asynchronous learning activities.

               When  asked  as  to  whether  the  teaching  and  learning  could  be  better  taught/learned  a/synchronously  or  not,
               60.61% of the participants reiterated the conduct of synchronous teaching and learning due to a more responsive
               discussion between the students and instructor which lead to a better understanding of the lesson. In addition,
               students viewed that some lessons cannot be learned through readings and self-study which is why the presence
               of  the  instructor  and  social  interaction  is  vital  in  learning.  On  the  other  hand,  30.30%  of  the  participants
               reiterated  the  conduct  of  asynchronous  teaching  and  learning  because  it  promotes  independent  learning.

               Meanwhile, 9.09% of the students were undecided (see Table 4).

               Already one-hour synchronous sessions were conducted during the semester, so the students were asked in the
               next question about the desirable duration of the session (see Table 5).   Four options were given in this regard:
               20, 30, 40 and 50 minutes. They were also given the option to give other comments.  Majority reiterated that
               synchronous sessions should be up to 50 minutes only.  This was due to some internet connectivity and screen
               time issues.

               When  asked  whether  they  actively  participate  in  synchronous  session,  69.7%  responded  yes  and  30.3%
               responded not active.  Some (30.3%) students could not afford to be active participants of synchronous sessions

               due to lack of gadgets, internet connectivity issues, or other work schedules (see Figure 3).

               In addition, they were asked whether a/synchronous activities helped them improve their academic performance.
               In synchronous activities, 78.79% replied yes, as it allows for a more dynamic exploration of topics, ideas, and
               concepts and 21.21% others replied no. In asynchronous activities, 48.48% replied yes, as it develops students‟
               to be more independent and responsible for their own learning and 27.27% others replied no as it makes them

               The research also sought participants‟ opinion about the strongest and weakest points of asynchronous learning
               activities. Majority of the respondents agreed that the strongest point of asynchronous learning activities is that

               it allows for independent learning as shown in Figure 4. Further, the absence of active presence in the discussion
               has been the weakest point of asynchronous learning activities as shown in Figure 5.

               Students’ Performance

               The Senior High  School  grades of the students  were collected from the  university registrar. The first batch,

               consisting of 39 students under the face to face learning modality has a mean SHS grade of 87.66 and standard
               deviation of 3.95 on their Senior High School academic performance. On the other hand, the second batch of 60
               students under the asynchronous learning modality has a mean of 88.28 on their Senior High School academic
               performance, with standard deviation of 2.88.

               Their academic performance during their Senior High School was determined to establish a point of comparison
               for  the  students‟  academic  performance  in  face  to  face  learning  activities  from  their  asynchronous  learning

               activities. Table 7 shows that there is no significant difference in their performance during Senior High School
               (SHS). Then they can be compared as to their performance in the face to face and alternative learning activities.

               significantly  higher  academic  performance  than  those  students  who  were  taught  with  alternative  learning
               modality (mean = 3.15, sd = 0.910) with t = -2.169, p < 0.05.  Hence, teaching and learning activities could still

               be  better  in  face-to-face  learning  modality  but  alternative  learning  mode  could  still  be  used  to  further  the
               learning during this time of pandemic.

               Conclusion


               The  COVID-19  outbreak  greatly  affected  the  education  sector.  Various  alternative  learning  activities  were
               considered by the tertiary education including the synchronous and asynchronous mode of online learning. This
               study showed that most students are familiar with the conduct of the said alternative learning activities. They
               reiterated that teaching and learning could be better taught/learned synchronously in a desirable duration of 50
               minutes  only.  When  it  comes  to  asynchronous  mode  of  learning,  the  use  of  video  discussions  and
               modules/lectures/handouts appealed most helpful to the learners. Majority of the students actively participate s

               in synchronous session as it allows for a more dynamic exploration of topics, ideas, and concepts. Moreover,
               asynchronous learning activities develop them to be more independent and responsible for their own learning.
               Overall, students preferred the combination of synchronous and asynchronous mode of learning in effectively
               facilitating  the  teaching  and  learning  process.  Further,  students  who  were  taught  with  face  to  face  learning
               modality has a significantly higher academic performance than those students who were taught with alternative

               learning modality. Hence, teaching and learning activities could still be better in face-to-face learning modality
               but alternative learning mode could still be used to further the learning during this time of pandemic.

               The study found out that the strongest point of asynchronous learning modality is that it allows for independent
               learning. On the other hand, its weakest point is the absence of active presence in the discussion and that the
               combination  of  synchronous  and  asynchronous  learning  activities  better  facilitate  the  teaching  and  learning
               process. Therefore, the authors recommend establishing constant feedback and communication with the students

               during the conduct of alternative learning activities.
