               According to the National Center for Education Statistics (1996), teaching for higher order thinking (HOT)
            along with professional development in HOT were found to be two of the top five variables positively associated
            with improved student achievement. Students of teachers who teach for both lower-order-thinking (LOT) and
            higher-order-thinking outperform students whose teachers only teach for LOT. Thus, Mathematics teachers
            should  have a  strong  conception  of  higher-order  thinking  and  sustain  it  as  an  integral  part  of  classroom
            instruction and assessment. With this, students will be able to meaningfully apply methods and concepts to
            situations previously unfamiliar to them. And because Bloom’s Taxonomy is a well-known model for teaching
            critical thinking skills in any subject area, it is used as a guide in creating test items.
               Also, based on the K – 12 Mathematics Curriculum Guide (2013), the twin goals of mathematics in the
            basic education levels are critical thinking and problem solving. Critical thinking, according to Scriven and
            Paul (1987) as cited in the 2013 Curriculum Guide, is the intellectually disciplined process of actively and
            skillfully conceptualizing, applying, analyzing, synthesizing, and/or evaluating information gathered from, or
            generated by, observation, experience, reflection, reasoning, or communication, as a guide to belief and action.
            On the other hand, according to Polya (1945, 1962), mathematical problem solving is finding a way around a
            difficulty, around an obstacle, and finding a solution to a problem that is unknown. These two goals are to be
            achieved with organized and rigorous curriculum content, a well-defined set of high-level skills and processes,
            desirable values and attitudes, and appropriate tools, taking into account the different contexts of Filipino
            learners.
               Critical  thinking  skills  have  become  a  generic  phase  used  to  encompass  many  processes  involved  in
            learning and problem solving. Several reasons are often given for teaching thinking skills. One reason given
            by Gough in 1997, which was affirmed by Nisbet and Schucksmith (2000), is that the world is changing rapidly
            and critical thinking skill is the most important element in today’s information age.
               Most countries like the Philippines are concerned with raising the educational standards throughout the
            compulsory  school  years.  The  Department  of  Education (DepEd  Order  No.  33,  s.  2004)  has  set  minimum
            desired learning competencies and mastery of the “basics” are exposed such as reading, writing, Mathematics
            and Science. These basics maybe excellently taught, but these are not sufficient to meet the demands of the
            labor market and active citizenship. It is now recognized that a broader range of competencies, redefined as
            higher-order thinking skills (HOTS), are required because:
               a.  The “banking theory” of knowledge based upon rote learning has been discredited as it is recognized
                  that individuals cannot “store” sufficient knowledge in their memories for future use.
               b.  Information is expanding at such a rate that individuals require transferable skills to allow them to
                  address different problems in different contexts at different times through their lives.
               c.  The  complexity  of  modern  jobs  requires  staff  who  demonstrates  comprehension  and  judgment  as
                  participants in the generation of knowledge or processes.
               d.  Modern society assumes active citizenship which requires individuals to assimilate information from
                  multiple sources, determine its veracity and make judgments.
               The cognitive skills developed by people in a society are profoundly influenced by the ways knowledge and
            literacy are taught and used. Thinking skills are viewed as crucial for educated persons to cope with a rapidly
            changing  world.  Many educators  believed  that  specific knowledge  will  not be  as  important  to  tomorrow’s
            workers and citizens as to the ability to learn and make sense of new information.
               According to Robinson (1997), if students are to function successfully in a highly technical society, then
            they must be equipped with life-long learning and thinking skills necessary to acquire and process in an ever-
            changing world. Moreover, Pascua (1991) mentioned that it is the higher-order thinking skills that enable an
            individual to learn more, to apply Mathematics in other disciplines and to solve problems throughout life.
               Bloom’s research as cited by Mergel in 1998, emphasized that in skill mastery, the teacher needs to focus
            and develop the higher-order thinking of students. There is substantial evidence that directed and controlled
            intervention  programs  can  improve  students’  abilities  to  give  more  original  and  unusual  solutions  to
            Mathematical problems of higher level.
               According to Balmaceda as cited by Laviña (2000), in the knowledge-based and technology-driven society
            of the next millennium, creativity, analytical skills, logical reasoning and critical thinking will be of paramount
            importance. These skills will be crucial in coping with the explosion of information and adapting to new and
            changing demands and challenges. The development of higher-order thinking skills (HOTS) and strategies to
            improve such has been  the focus of educators in recent years, partly in response to the challenges of the
