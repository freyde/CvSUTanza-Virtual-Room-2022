               Title:   Virtual Teachers’ Orientation and Capability Enhancement Seminar Workshop


               Rationale

                       The Higher Education 4.0 trends and future perspectives for teaching and learning are
               equally affected by the rapid changes we are facing today. These trends are significant to meet
               the future needs and challenges in education through the pervasive application of Information and
               Communication Technology (ICT).  In addition, the emergence of COVID-19 pandemic and the
               imminent presence of different COVID-19 variants (Delta) brought unforeseen disruptions in
               the lives of people all over the world.  The Philippine higher education institutions (HEIs) are
               no exemption in facing such critical situations.  To ensure the continuity of learning among
               tertiary students while avoiding and/or limiting the risks of infection in the community, HEIs
               explored and shifted to other innovative learning modalities that transmigrate the conduct of
               classes  from  traditional  to  flexible  learning  modalities,  which  gave  students  the  option  to
               choose the most convenient delivery modes to them.  This flexible learning modality emerged
               during the First Semester of Academic Year 2020–2021 where it was used for the conduct of
               lecture classes, leaving behind the conduct of laboratory classes that require a more rigid
               training for students in face-to-face classes.

                       As CvSU Tanza increases its enrolment during the First Semester of AY 2021 – 2022, from
               1,154 students last year now caters a projected 1700 enrollees, thus compelling the campus to
               hire additional faculty members. With this, there is an urgent need to conduct faculty orientation
               and re-orientation and further explore other innovative flexible learning modalities that suit the
               capacity, capability, and connectivity of our teachers and learners.

               Objectives
                       The activity aims to provide our faculty members with additional information and enhance
               different ways on  flexible  learning  modality of education delivery  with  the aid of  ICT and new
               technologies.


               Implementation
                       The Campus Administrator together with all faculty members will attend the said activity on
               September 2 – 3, 2021 from 1:00pm to 5:00pm via Zoom/WebEx.]]></page><page Index="19"><![CDATA[Program of Activities

                       Cavite  State  University  –  Tanza  Campus  conducted  a  virtual  faculty
               orientation on September 3, 2020 thru Zoom to help all the newly hired and rehired

               faculty and staff of the campus make a smooth and enjoyable transition to the new

               normal of education and to prove that a crisis cannot impair its academic functions.
               The program started with a prayer led by Mr. Mark Joel C. Sibulo and followed by the

               AVP of CvSU at a Glance which featured the humble beginnings of the University

               and its vision of becoming a global University.
                       Meanwhile, Prof. Noel A. Sedigo, T3 Campus Administrator, welcomed all the

               faculty members and staff with gratitude as he witnessed the untiring support and

                          TEACHER’S CAPABILITY ENHANCEMENT SEMINAR
                                                 February 13, 2020

                       Cavite  State  University  –  Tanza  Campus  held  a  capability

               enhancement seminar for teachers at Hostel Tropicana of Cavite State

               University–Main Campus on February 13, 2020. This was conducted to

               provide the faculty members with an additional credential that will certify

               their competence to teach their course effectively. Besides, the training

               aimed to empower faculty members for them to strengthen their sound

               educational  principles  and  the  capacity  and  willingness  to  transform

               others and one’s self. The program started with a prayer led by Mr. Mark

               Joel C. Sibulo and followed by the AVP of the National Anthem.

                       Meanwhile,  Prof.  Noel  A.  Sedigo,  T3  Campus  Administrator,

               welcomed all the faculty members with confidence as he is certain that

               the  training  will  eventually  gear  them  towards  excellence.  He  firmly

               believed that this training will harness the full potential of faculty members

               in delivering quality instruction to their students.

                       Moreover, Mr. Mark Joel C. Sibulo, Chairperson of the Department

               of Arts and Sciences, presented the CvSU Vision and Mission, and T3

               Campus Goals.  This was followed  by  the presentation  of  Mr.  Ritch  M.

               Banate,  Chairperson  of  the  Department  of  Management  on  program

               educational objectives and outcomes of the various programs offered by

               the Campus.

                       After  that,  the  training  on  teaching  strategies  and  classroom

               management was facilitated by Dr. Noel B. Manarpiis. During the training,]]></page><page Index="37"><![CDATA[each faculty member learned effective ways on how to manage their class

               and teaching strategies that will help them deliver quality instruction.

                       Furthermore, Prof. Arlene L. Estrada, GAD Coordinator, discussed

               the integration of gender-fair language on course syllabi which is really

               vital to ensure gender-responsive and sensitive instruction. In connection

               with this, Ms. Shaine C. Hayag, HR Coordinator of CvSU – General Trias

               Campus discussed the code of conduct and ethical standards for public

               officials and employees to ensure that employees always observed the

               mandates.

                       Additionally, Mr. Keno A. Villavicencio, DIT Chairperson of CvSU –

               Trece Martires City Campus facilitated the training on technology-aided

               education which was followed by the training on course syllabus facilitated

               by Prof. Mildred A. Sebastian, TED Chairperson.

                       Also, Ms. Gerry Mae T. Silvero, tackled test construction, and table

               of specifications. It was followed by the discussion of Ms. Ivory Mojica

               about  rubrics  preparation.  A  workshop  was  conducted  right  after  their

               presentations for the faculty members to create their own exam with TOS

               and sample rubrics where they presented it for enhancement.

                       The seminar was ended with the closing statement of Ms. Joyce

               Erika S. Senaris, DIT Chairperson, who said that as an educator, it is the

               obligation of faculty members to continuously enrich their capability  as

               change is inevitable as well as the dimension of education. It was a great

               opportunity  to  expose  the  faculty  members  to  various  enhancement

               training  that  will  ensure  their  preparedness  and  be  able  to  fill  in  the


               demands of higher education.]]></page><page Index="38"><![CDATA[PHOTO DOCUMENTATION

                   they already successfully filled the necessary number of faculty members in the department. Ms.
                   Sebastian, the chair of the Teacher Education Department also reported that they already have]]></page><page Index="46"><![CDATA[complete number of faculty members. She then opened her concern about the deployment of their
                   students as practice teachers for face-to-face teaching. She asked if they can hold a face-to-face
                   demonstration teaching in the campus for them to assess their students’ readiness, knowledge,
                   and skills in actual teaching, before their deployment. This will be held for 3 days, with 42 Education
                   students and they plan to start the activity the following week. Prof. Ramos approved the request
                   and advised that they may not deploy the students who will not pass their assessment.
                          Ms. Fabian then reported about the recruitment of faculty members for the Department of
                   Arts and Sciences being completed. She also said that the Job Order faculty members especially
                   the newly hired should submit their requirements as soon as possible for their contracts.
                          In  line  with  the  preparation  of  the  opening  of  classes,  Prof.  Ramos  asked  the  faculty
                   members to follow the prescribed syllabus in their handled courses. He then asked Ms. Sebastian
                   about  any  updates  regarding  the  NBC.  Ms.  Sebastian  told  the  group  that  those  who  will  be
                   promoted to one to three steps are already certain of the reclassification while those who will be
                   promoted to at least four steps will still wait for BOR approval.
                          The meeting then proceeded to the next agenda which is the admission and enrolment.
                   Ms. Perida, the campus registrar, reported that there are 556 qualified first year students who
                   already confirmed their slots but only 369 of them submitted the necessary requirements. Prof.
                   Ramos then asked Ms. Perida to extend the deadline of requirements until September 16, 2022,
                   Friday. Ms. Perida then added that there are already 1200 old students enrolled. She also reported
                   that there are four students who requested transfer credentials to transfer to CvSU-Cavite City
                   campus but currently requesting to return to the campus because they were not able to secure
                   their slots in Cavite City. However, because their transfer credentials were already signed and
                   released, their request to return were not granted.
                          Prof. Ramos then opened the next agenda which is the campus designation. He told the
                   group that the campus needs reappointment of designations. First, he will be the department chair
                   of the Department of Arts and Sciences but Mr. Mark Joel Sibulo will help him perform his duties
                   as chair. Second, Ms. Sebastian will still be the research coordinator of the campus. He then told
                   the group to include the performance of their designations as one of their priorities. He announced
                   that Dr. Polinga already approved the designation of the staff to administrative positions.
                          He also announced that the campus will no longer have an official campus vehicle because
                   he already returned it to the main campus. Proceeding to the next agenda, he asked TED to get
                   an update about English Critic accreditation to have additional accredited English Critic in the
                   campus.
                          For the next agenda, he announced that it was already allowed to use textbooks and he
                   suggested  that  the  campus  sell  textbooks  as  an  income-generating  project.  Prof.  Ramos
                   recommended his books to be sold but reminded that the students should not be required to buy
                   the textbooks that the campus will sell.
                          Prof.  Ramos  shared  to  the  group  that  the  main  campus  will  be  having  an  extension
                   program in Brgy. Bagtas which is planting kaong. They plan to hold a transfer of technology to
                   Bagtas  residents,  specifically  the  production  of  vinegar  and  sugar  from  kaong.  Prof.  Ramos
                   suggested that the campus anchor its extension program to this activity of the main campus.
                   However, Ms. Villa, the extension program coordinator of the campus told the group that there is
                   already an approved campus extension program.
                          Other matters discussed during the meeting includes the request of Prof. Ramos to have
                   a copy of the raw data of the monthly attendance report of the faculty. He added that in line with
                   the  new  HR  Memo  on  work  arrangement,  the  faculty  members  will  continue  to  follow  their
                   alternative work arrangement schedule (two days WFH and two days campus reporting) while the
                   non-academic staff will be reporting to the campus four days a week. He then announced that Ms.
                   Fabian and Mr. Fred will be the liaison officers.
                          After this, Prof. Ramos shared some reminders for the opening of classes. He reminded
                   the group to be not too lenient to the students. With this, Ms. Sebastian shared that the TED will
                   be starting to require student attendance to class meetings.
                          The meeting adjourned at 2:54 PM.]]></page><page Index="47"><![CDATA[Prepared by:                                   Certified Correct:

                   come up with a proposal on course offering of the campus that is different from the courses offered
                   by the nearby campuses. He suggested that the DAS should have its own program offering like a

                          He asked the group about the status of preparation for COPC. Ms. Sebastian reported that
                   the preparation is already 80% completed but they are having problems with the facility of the
                   campus. She proposed that the faculty room be used as laboratory and lecture rooms. The campus
                   was able to borrow 30 computers from the students and proposed to have a memorandum of
                   agreement with Bagtas Elementary School and Tanza National Trade School for borrowing of
                   additional computers.
                          Prof. Ramos opened the concern about the P5,000 being requested by the Department of
                   Information Technology for the installation of tiles in the computer laboratory and shared to the
                   group that he already asked Dr. Manuel about it and was told that the requested improvement is
                   not required. He then asked about update on the requested purchase of equipment and facilities
                   for accreditation. Ms. Sebastian reported that Dr. Polinga held over the purchase request because
                   the campus has no available space. Prof. Ramos then told the group that because there is lack of
                   support from the administration, the campus can document whatever is available in the campus
                   and use the result of evaluation as the basis of what to improve in the campus. After this, Ms.
                   Senaris shared the problem of the department about the lack of faculty member with master’s
                   degree and reported that she included Ms. Lewis from Trece Martires City Campus to the list of
                   faculty.
                          Prof. Ramos then shared that the donated lot for Tanza Campus was already presented
                   during the academic council meeting. He also shared to the group that he already requested to
                   the OVPAA that the campus will continue to hold online classes because of the lack of campus
                   facilities. Mr. Mark Sibulo then asked if there is already a target date of constructing the new]]></page><page Index="56"><![CDATA[campus  building.  Prof.  Ramos  answered  that  there  is  still  no  concrete  schedule  about  the
                   construction.
                          Mr. Banate then reported about their department’s preparation for COPC. He shared that
                   he is already finalizing the presentation and was able to borrow faculty from the main campus
                   resulting to 84% faculty members having master’s degree. He then told Prof. Ramos that Mr.
                   Mintu,  the  Brgy.  Bagtas  Chairperson,  is  asking  about  the  schedule  of  MOA  signing  with  the
                   University for the lot donated to Tanza campus. Prof. Ramos said that it is still on process of
                   approval.
                          Prof. Ramos then shared that the mock presentation of TED for COPC was postponed but
                   each department should continue their preparation. He also reminded the group to just present
                   what is available in the campus. He then asked for understanding for not being able to go to the
                   campus for health concerns and thanked the group for all their efforts.
                          After this, Ms. Banag presented the proposed streamlined designations.
                          Ms. Fabian then reminded the Contract of Service faculty members to submit authority to
                   go two days before the schedule because it needs to be submitted to different offices.
                          Prof. Ramos shared that the campus is not oblige to conduct a face-to-face class and to
                   be able to implement limited face-to-face, the campus must submit the necessary documents for
                   application  for  F2F  and  approval  from  the  LGU  is  also  necessary.  The  faculty  members  and
                   students must also be fully vaccinated and the students should have their parent’s consent.
                          Before the meeting ends, Ms. Addangna extended her gratitude to Ms. Sebastian, Mr.
                   Delgado, Ms. Fabian, and Mr. Mark Sibulo for being approachable.
                          The meeting adjourned at 12:15 PM.

         58        requested everyone to share any information regarding the meeting about the conduct of online
         59        OJT.  Ms. Mary Rose Elamparo attended the virtual OJT meeting for the BSBM program. She
         60        announced that they were able to prepare the proposal for further endorsement and approval
         61        of the University Academic council to the Board of Regents.  It was reiterated that OJT shall
         62        be conducted online and the campus may accommodate OJT students in the campus but to
         63        ensure that the tasks are aligned to the program where the students are enrolled.
         64
         65               Ms. Mildred A. Sebastian mentioned that there will also be virtual student teaching
         66        internship for the coming first semester, but BSE students shall complete first the first two field
         67        studies  (EDFS  21  and  EDFS  22)  before  they  could  conduct  their  online  student  teaching
         68        internship.  EDFS 21 is offered during the current semester, and EDFS 22 will be offered during
         69        the Midyear Term.
         70
         71               Ms. Maria Kristina Galicha announced that she attended the meeting for BSHM/BSTM
         72        programs.  They were able to formulate the proposal and guidelines for the virtual OJT but like
         73        the  other  programs,  the  proposal  is  yet  to  be  approved  and  further  information  shall  be
         74        announced sooner or later, depending on the results of the approval of the proposal.  Working
         75        students whose nature of jobs are aligned with their program of course may seek for credit of
         76        their OJT as long as the competencies for a particular skill are achieved.  In addition, Ms.
         77        Elamparo mentioned that BSHM/BSTM students who wished to conduct the OJT shall pay a
         78        minimum amount of PhP4,000 to complete their virtual OJT.  Due to this, she made a poll with
         79        the BSHM students if ever they would pursue the virtual OJT and pay the necessary amount.
         80        Based on the results, most of the students signified their non-intention to pursue the virtual
         81        OJT due to financial constraints.
         82
         83               Prof. Ramos announced that the CHED is now offering Scholarships for Instructors'
         84        Knowledge Advancement Program (SIKAP) for faculty members who wish to pursue graduate
         85        degree programs in CHED recognized schools. He mentioned that CHED Region IV-A Director
         86        Amelia Biglete encouraged everyone to pursue graduate degree programs in universities in
         87        the  CALABARZON  region.     Faculty  members  can  visit  the  CHED  website  for  further
         88        information.
         89
         90               Prof.  Ramos  announced  that  as  per  Director  Biglete,  the  First  National  Higher
         91        Education Day of the Commission on Higher Education will be held on May 7-21, 2021.  He
         92        will be sending the memorandum from the CHED in the group chat of the campus, where each
         93        campus of the university shall be enjoined to attend and participate.
         94
         95               Prof. Ramos inquired about the preparation of the documents relative to the COPC
         96        application of the campus.  The College of Education, Office of the Graduate School, Naic
         97        Campus and Carmona Campus had already finished the virtual validation.  Prof. Sebastian
         98        mentioned that the preparation of the said documents is on-going. There have been some
         99        problems encountered as regards some supplies and materials relative to the preparation.
        100        Prof. Ramos pledged that the funds shall be available in terms of the campus cash advance.
        101        However, Ms. Noemi Perida mentioned that she encountered difficulties in canvassing some
        102        supplies and materials because there was a tight budget.  Prof. Sebastian made mentioned
        103        that  the  group  also  find  it  difficult  to  get  certified  copies  of  faculty  credentials  since  the
        104        University Records Office does not certify copies of TOR and diploma who are not graduates
        105        of the university.  Also, faculty members cannot be compelled to travel and get their TOR and
        106        diploma as certified true copy.
        107
        108               Prof. Ramos announced that the class observation shall push through as planned.  This
        109        will be from May 10 – 13, 2021.  This shall serve as one of the evaluation requirements for re-
        110        hiring of faculty members.
        111
        112               Prof. Ramos was happy to know that every permanent and temporary faculty members
        113        are enjoying their workload.  He also announced that the deadline of submission for the Unified]]></page><page Index="59"><![CDATA[114        Workload  System  will  be  June  10,  2021  and  no  more  extension  shall  be  given.    Faculty
        115        members who are entitled to workload credits are advised to submit their workload documents
        116        before June 10, 2021 to avoid non-inclusion in the evaluation.
        117
        118               The admission of new students in the main campus already reached the 18,000-mark.
        119        However, they could only accommodate a total of 6,200 students in the different programs
        120        offered in the university. Those who will not qualify in the main campus will be transferred in
        121        the satellite campuses.
        122
        123               The meeting adjourned at 5:30 PM.

         53               The meeting started at 3:00 PM with Prof. Gil D. Ramos as the presiding officer.  Before
         54        he officially discussed the main agenda of the meeting, he had some announcements for the
         55        group based on the administrative council meeting that was held the other day.  He announced
         56        that the campus water supply will be provided by the Office of the ABC President, Hon. SM]]></page><page Index="65"><![CDATA[57        Matro.  He also announced that the PhP4.5-million allotment for the two-storey building of
         58        CvSU Tanza Campus has been approved and that the group could expect its construction in
         59        the near future.  He further announced that the PhP50-million allotment for the 3-5 storey
         60        building of the campus has been approved.  The campus shall seek the assistance of the
         61        Bagtas LGU for any donation of land to realize this vision, especially when the campus shall
         62        be subjecting four of its programs under the CHED visit to obtain the Certificates of Program
         63        Compliance.
         64
         65               Another  concern  that  was  being  raised  during  the  Administrative  Council  was  the
         66        complaints through the 8888.  Most of Contract of Service (COS) Faculty members were filing
         67        concerns regarding the delay of salaries.  He sympathized with those faculty members but he
         68        mentioned that these faculty members must expedite all possible means to complete their
         69        requirements in order not to delay their salaries.
         70
         71               He  announced  that  each  faculty  member  shall  give  major  examinations,  such  as
         72        midterm and final exams in line with the school calendar.  However, faculty members shall
         73        have the leeway on when to give their midterm examination, depending on the lessons that
         74        were already discussed.
         75
         76               Prof. Ramos shared to the group that there was an alleged Diploma Factory in Tanza,
         77        being posted in the Facebook. This was discussed during the Administrative Council Meeting.
         78        He  requested  everyone  to  help  the  campus  in  tracking  down  the  source  or  production  of
         79        falsified documents.
         80
         81               He announced that there will be also class observation after the midterm examination.
         82        He requested everyone to submit their schedule of classes for the classroom observation.  This
         83        shall be the basis for re-hiring of faculty members for the next semester.
         84
         85               He  announced  that  the  Office  of  the  University  President  request  each  campus  to
         86        prepare  its  dashboard  of  information.    This  shall  include  all  primary  tools  and  general
         87        information about CvSU Tanza Campus.  He assigned the MIS officer and the four department
         88        chairpersons to take charge of this task.
         89
         90               The Socio-Cultural Development Coordinator presented the proposed Socio-Cultural

                   •  The school calendar for the school year 2022-2023 is being discussed:

                   •  The first day of classes is September 12, 2022.
                   •  The deadline for adding or changing subjects is September 30th.

                   •  The deadline for dropping subjects without an evaluation is October 7, 2022.
                   •  The  copies  of  the  students'  registration  certificates  (COR)  must  be  checked  by  all
                       instructors  for  each  course  because  there  are  students  who  are  not  formally

                       registered but are nevertheless attending classes.
                   •  Do not accept a student in your class if he or she does not have a copy of his or her

                       COR.
                   •  There is no need for a preliminary examination. It is up to the course instructor.

                   •  There will be a midterm exam. It is conducted either in person or online. It is entirely
                       up to the course instructor. However, make sure that a face-to-face midterm exam is
                       scheduled ahead of time.

                   •  The academic break is set to take place from November 14 to November 19, 2022.
                       Make certain that no assessments are given to students during the academic break
                       so that they can enjoy their time off.

                   •  The  final  examination  for  graduating  students  is  scheduled  from  January  16  to
                       January  21,  2023,  while  the  final  examination  for  non-graduating  students  is

                       online. It is entirely up to the course instructor. However, make sure that a face-to-
                       face midterm exam is scheduled ahead of time.

                   •  If  the  course  instructor's  final  examination  is  about  culminating  activities  such  as
                       demonstration teaching, it must be conducted face-to-face. However, make certain

                       that it is approved and scheduled ahead of time.
                   •  The deadline for submitting and uploading grades is February 7, 2023.

                   •  A  second  agenda  is  being  discussed.  It's  about  a  Teacher  Education  Department

                       assigned to an Educ Congress activity, while Sir Marlou has been assigned to the

                       Faculty Research Forum.
                   •  Each instructor is required to review their online portfolio. They must ensure that it is

                       finished. These are the lists that will be submitted at the conclusion of the semester:
                       class records, quizzes, activities, sample student outputs, projects, modules, syllabi,
                       midterm exam, and final exam, TOS, and sample grading sheet.

                   •  Each instructor must submit a letter of intent along with their completed portfolio as
                       part of their requirements if they want to continue serving at CvSU-Tanza.]]></page><page Index="81"><![CDATA[•  Each instructor must have a non-disclosure agreement and a syllabus acceptance

                   •  The students must be informed that they are not allowed to share any materials from
                       outside organizations.

                   •  As soon as feasible, the Teacher Education Department should start planning for the

                   •  The online class observation for accreditation will take place from November 14 to

          31   strictly. The security guards were oriented to check every employee's temperature coming in and
          32   reminded them to use alcohol to sanitize their hands and of the visitors upon entering the campus
          33   premises. Likewise the so-called social distancing should be strictly imposed. Further, he emphasized
          34   that  each  campus  will  undergo  an  immediate  disinfection  with  the  help  of  the  campus  utility
          35   personnel.
          36
          37       Each faculty member is advised by Prof. Sedigo to prepare the course syllabus as early as now. He
          38   reminded all department chairs to give all faculty loads so that they can prepare course syllabi and
          39   modules, which is due on July 30, 2020. Mr. Luke Ty presented a lecture on how to design course
          40   syllabi and modules applicable in today's new normal environment. The approach is blended, online,
          41   and modular.
          42
          43       Prof.  Sedigo  suggested  to  the  faculty  to  be  clear  about  the  references.  References  must  be
          44   coordinated with the campus librarian for listing and acquisition of books. Ms. Villarante, the campus
          45   librarian, agreed and added that references, particularly electronic references, will be incorporated
          46   into the campus e-library.
          47
          48       Ms. Noemi Perida clarifies if possible to allow second-year students (HM and IT) to apply for
          49   graduation or  proceed  for  a  BS  degree. Prof.  Sedigo  responded  with, "yes  they  can."  He  further
          50   reminded everyone that T3 Campuses would not be having midyear classes for 2020. Ms. Feranail
          51   added that the students in the following semesters could take those subjects scheduled for midyear
          52   class 2020.

          55   given the subjects to be taught by each of the faculty members under their departments. Likewise,
          56   all other department chairs also assured that they already distributed subjects to the respective
          57   faculty members under their department.
          58
          59       Prof. Sedigo announced to submit requirements or faculty portfolios before the deadline to avoid
          60   the  salary  delay.  He  likewise  asked  why  most  of  Trece  Campus  faculty  members  have  not  yet
          61   submitted their grading sheets. Some answered that they still need to get their student files and
          62   records from the campus to do so.
          63
          64       Also, Prof. Sedigo reminded the department chairs and HR coordinators to finalize the number of
          65   faculty to be hired this First Semester AY 2020-2021 and in as much as possible consider those with
          66   masters’ degree and as well as doctors’ degree. This is in consideration for bolstering the faculty
          67   profile of the campuses and also for long term considerations.

          35   Feranil said that summer subjects could be taken during the next semesters instead if there would
          36   take no midyear classes for T3. According to Prof. Sedigo, the midyear period will be devoted to the

          50   that she already distributed the loads to the respective department chairs; however, none of the

          64   REALIGNMENT OF BUDGET
          65       Prof. Sedigo instructed the Budget Officers to realign the budget, such as the budget for seminars,

          67   normal classes.
          68
          69   GRADES AND TEACHING PORTFOLIO
          70       Prof. Sedigo reminded all to submit the grades and teaching portfolio on time to avoid delay on

          72   to check all the requirements of faculty upon submission.
          73
          74   HEALTH PROTOCOLS
          75       Dr. Demetillo, T3 Secretary, presented some of the health protocols and preventive measures
          76   against COVID 19 to the T3 campuses key officials. Prof. Sedigo advised Ms. Lontoc to facilitate the
          77   purchase  request  of  alcohol,  masks,  temperature  scanners,  foot  disinfectant  mats,  etc.  for  T3
          78   campuses.  He  likewise  instructed  the  campus  coordinators  to  help  monitor  in  ensuring  the
          79   compliance of the mentioned health protocols. Ms. Lontoc responded and she said that she will do it
          80   immediately.

          28       Prof. Noel A. Sedigo, the campus administrator, said that T3 campuses would create a skeletal
          29   workforce  who  will  report  to  their  respective  campuses  as  soon  as  the  Enhanced  Community
          30   Quarantine  is  lifted.  Included  in  the  skeletal  workforce  are  the  regular  faculty  members  with
          31   designations and all the non- teaching personnel. On the other hand, all faculty members with a
          32   service status contract will be working from home.
          33
          34      Dr. Jessie Anne T. Demetillo agreed that she would prepare the proposed skeletal workforce with
          35   Alternative Work Assignments for submission and approval of the Office of the Vice President for

          43      Prof. Sedigo advised the faculty that grades for the Second  Semester, AY 2019-2020, will only be
          44   SATISFACTORY, NO GRADE OR DROPPED.
          45
          46      Prof. Cristza de Ocampo asked about the grades that will be given to the OJT student who has not
          47   started their second phase of the OJT practicum.
          48
          49      Prof. Sedigo answered that in as long as the student had started their first phase OJT program and
          50   had their MOA or MOU, it is acceptable to give a grade of SATISFACTORY. For OJT, EDP, and Thesis
          51   requirements, only  a  narrative  report will  be  submitted  by  the  students  as  compliance  with  the
          52   requirement.

          60
          61      Prof. Sedigo also responded with a Yes.
          62
          63      Prof. Sedigo consulted, and the body agreed to have no mid-year classes for the T3 campuses this
          64   2020. He said that First Semester AY 2020 would start in August, and thus faculty members without
          65   designation will be reporting only in August 2020. Further, he confirmed that there is still a graduation
          66   plan, and it will right after when the COVID is over.

          56       Prof. Sedigo presented the Calendar of Activities, Second Semester 2020, and reminded all to be
          57   always prepared for the upcoming activities and deadlines of compliances.
          58
          59       Prof. Sedigo requested Prof. Feranil (Trece Campus), Prof. Sebastian (Tanza Campus) and Dr.
          60   Manarpiis (Gentri Campus) to prepare the IMDU Committee Campus immediately to be submitted to
          61   the Office of the University President for approval. And, they all agreed with Prof. Sedigo.
          62
          63       As  to  midterm  examination,  Prof.  Sedigo  reminded  all  faculty  to  prepare  and  submit  their
          64   midterm examinations with TOS to their respective Department Chairs at least two weeks before the
          65   scheduled exam for review and approval before reproduction.
          66
          67       The University Games and as well as Foundation Day are yet to be rescheduled per campus.
          68   However,  for T3 campuses,  it  was agreed  to  have a  temporary  schedule  for the  foundation  day
          69   celebrations and solidarity programs as follows: Trece: May 6, 2020; Tanza: May 7, 2020, and Gentri:
          70   May 8, 2020.
          71
          72       Prof. Noel A. Sedigo calls the attention of Ms. Mary Ann L. Anonas, T3 registrar, and the rest of
          73   the registrar aid to do the counterchecking of the Master List to ensure correct billing as to the
          74   number of the enrolled students. Ms. Anonas said she had already done the counterchecking of the
          75   master  list.  She  even  visited  the  Gen.  Trias  City  campus  to  ensure  the  records'  accuracy  to  be
          76   submitted at the main campus. Likewise, all OSAS Head and CSG advisers are requested to process
          77   the students' insurance as soon as possible.
          78
          79       Prof. Sedigo also reminded the permanent, temporary, and casual faculty and staff to submit PDS
          80   and SALN to the HR Coordinator to be submitted on or before March 16, 2020, at the main campus.
          81
          82       As per Prof. Sedigo, Flexi-time is still up, and the use of biometrics is always encouraged. He
          83   requested Dr. Demetillo to prepare a letter to ask the qualified T3 personnel to allow Flexi-time
          84   because of the other designations they have. Prof. Sedigo also informed Ms. Hosmillo to request a
          85   new biometric for Trece Campus since it is no longer working.
          86
          87       Mr. Laynes reiterated  that Gentri Campus  could hardly impose  the solid waste management
          88   program since they are occupying three locations. The guards could barely monitor the students'
          89   activities in disposing of their garbage.
          90       Prof. Sedigo reminds Ms. Manlapig to remind the canteen owners about garbage disposal and
          91   Ms. Lontoc, Mr. Cajigas, and Mr. Laynes to monitor solid waste management for each campus.
          92
          93       Mr. Cajigas requested for a truck and driver to pick up the chairs in Las Pinas donated by the
          94   concerned foundation. Prof. Sedigo asked John to coordinated the said request to the main campus.
          95
          96   No further matter was discussed.
          97
          98   The meeting adjourned at 2:15 p.m.

               of the T3 campuses, CvSU Tanza, Gen. Trias City, and Trece Martires City Campuses

               facilities and its development through the years. It was followed by the introduction of

               T3 key officials, support personnel, faculty per department and students class adviser
               per program.

                       Meanwhile,  Ms.  Mary  Ann  L.  Anonas,  T3  Campus  Registrar,  discussed  the
               academic  policies  and  grading  system  followed  by  the  discussion  of  different

                       Furthermore,  Ms.  Loran  Camille  Villarante  oriented  the  students  about  the

               CvSU e-Library System Open Education Resources and Creative Commons.

                       In  addition,  an  open  forum  was  conducted  to  answer  the  questions  of  the
               students  and  to  enlighten  them  about  the  “new  normal”  academic  set-up  of  T3

               Campuses. During the open forum, various questions were raised by the students and

               were  answered  by  Prof.  Noel  A.  Sedigo,  T3  Campus  Administrator,  and  other  key
               officials.

                       The virtual orientation ended with the closing statement of Prof. Sedigo with his
               emphasis  that  despite  the  pandemic,  T3  Campuses  will  continue  serving  and

               providing quality education and ensuring that no students will be left behind.

                                RESULTS OF COMMUNITY NEEDS ASSESSMENT
                                     IN BARANGAY BAGTAS, TANZA, CAVITE


                       The population explosion in Brgy. Bagtas has led to an initiative to alleviate
               poverty  in  the  barangay.  Brgy.  Bagtas,  having  the  most  number  of  populations  in

               Tanza  (20,370  out  of  188,755),  has  been  the  site  for  relocation  and  reclamation.
               However, people, who were displaced out of their previous addresses, were relocated

               in the said barangay without having a regular source of living. Some of them could not

               find a decent job because they lack the educational and other requirements for the job
               that they were applying for. Others could not start any business because they lack the

               skills in preparing innovative products that could help them earn additional income for
               their families.

                       Thus,  Cavite  State  University  –  Tanza  Campus  shall  launch  a  full-blown
               extension program through the Research and Extension Office. The campus extension

               program shall be called as “BAGTAS with CvSU – Tanza (Bagtas ay Aasenso at

               Giginhawa kung Tayo Ay Sama-sama with CvSU – Tanza)”. The main goal of the
               program is to increase the quality of life of the citizens in the said barangay.

                       For  this  reason,  it  is  essential  to  conduct  a  Community  Needs  Assessment

               (CNA) aiming to identify the needs in order to provide appropriate services to those
               needs.  CNA  will  provide  database  information  on  the  current  status  of  each

               community.  The  study  will  also  be  able  to  provide  a  framework  for  identifying
               appropriate  community,  profiling  of  their  needs,  and  provide  sustainable  extension

               program to meet specific needs.
                       Cavite State University – Tanza Campus is located in Tanza, Cavite so, the

               extension  unit  has  chosen  one  of  the  barangays  in  Tanza  to  be  adopted  for  its

               extension activities. It adopted barangay Bagtas since this is the barangay that has
               the most number of populations in the Municipality of Tanza.]]></page><page Index="152"><![CDATA[Results and Quantitative Summary of Community Needs Assessment
                       A committee was formed to study and gather benchmark information on the

               status, needs, and conditions of selected communities in Tanza, Cavite during the
               second  semester,  AY  2014  –  2015.  The  committee  was  headed  by  the  Extension

               Coordinator. Two faculty members from the different departments of the campus were

               selected as members of the committee to ensure that the programs will conform to the
               mandate of the university. The committee used the following benchmark information,

               provided by Tanza Municipal Planning and Development Office (TMPDO), in order to
               assess which group of individuals will be the target beneficiaries of the proposal.

               The committee used the descriptive design of a study. Data utilized in the study mainly

               came  from  the  responses  on  the  self-administered  survey  questions  that  were
               distributed to the residents of Brgy. Bagtas. Residents were selected using simple

               random sampling.
                       Results revealed that:

                          •  87.14% of the residents perceived that they lack regular sources of living
                              in the barangay because most (48.15%) of them lack the educational
                              requirements and some (38.99%) lack the technical skills to either start
                              a small business or to apply for a regular job;]]></page><page Index="153"><![CDATA[•  47.06% of the residents believed that these problems and issues may

                         NARRATIVE REPORT ON COMMUNITY NEEDS ASSESSMENT


                       Cavite  State  University  –  Tanza  Campus  conducted  a  community  needs

               assessment in Barangay Bagtas, Tanza, Cavite on January 30-31 and February 7,
               2015. The activity was headed by the campus extension coordinator, Ms. Mildred A.

               Sebastian. The officers and members of different student organization such as CSG,

               FAME, COPE and CSS, assisted in conducting interviews among the residents of the
               community. The event was also participated by the other faculty members and key

               officials of the campus.


                       The needs assessment was done to address the needs, problems or gaps

               between current conditions and desired conditions of the community. This also helps
               to identify the strengths and resources available in the community to meet the needs

               of the children, youth and families. This assessment pays particular attention to the
               capabilities of the community, including its citizens, agencies, and local organizations.



                       Prior  to  the  needs  assessment,  the  extension  coordinator  talked  to  the
               barangay captain over the phone, to offer an extension project that can cater the

               needs of the community. The barangay captain was overwhelmed to hear that the
               campus will help them to alleviate poverty in the barangay through this extension

               project. He also said that he is really willing to provide any assistance for the success

               of the project.


                       As the interview and needs assessment started, one of the barangay staff also
               accompanied  the  group  in  going  to  the  houses  of  the  residents.  Prepared

               questionnaires were used during the interview. The assessment went well because

               the interviewees were very cooperative. It was indeed a productive day for the group.]]></page><page Index="157"><![CDATA[Certificate of appearance which was duly signed by the barangay captain was

                                               OPLAN KARUNUNGAN
                                  (ALS Classes to Out-of-School Youths and Adults)



                       Cavite State University - Tanza Campus is now an ALS provider after the chairperson

               of the Sangguniang Kabataan sought help to the Extension Services of the campus. Ms. Ma,
               Kathleena Rose J. Arca, the SK Chairperson of Barangay Bagtas asked the campus to become

               one of the ALS providers in Bagtas through its program Oplan Karunungan. She believed
               that  the  campus  is  really  suitable  on  providing  quality  instruction  to  ALS  students.  The

               campus is very glad to provide help to the barangay particularly in increasing numeracy and

               literacy in the adopted community. The campus immediately coordinated to the representative
               of  Dep-Ed  ALS  in  Bagtas  about  the  MOA  and  schedules  of  classes.  The  Campus  and

               representative of Dep-Ed ALS agreed to each terms and conditions and set the date when to
               start the classes for the new ALS students.

                       Before the start of the classes, the campus also posted announcements on its Facebook

               page to increase the number of ALS enrollees. During the orientation, 29 ALS enrollees
               attended the orientation. These 29 enrollees are composed of out-of-school youths and adults

               who wished to finish their secondary education. The ALS orientation was attended by the
               faculty members of the campus, Dep-Ed ALS representative and the barangay chairperson

               and his staff.
                       During the first class of ALS students, Ms. Mildred A. Sebastian, chairperson of TED,

               served as the lecturer for Mathematics lesson and digital literacy at the same time. Other faculty

               members served as the lecturers in the succeeding days of ALS classes. Ms. Charmaine T.
               Banag served as the lecturer for Digital Literacy. Dr. Noel B. Manarpiis served as the lecturer

               for English and Communication subjects. Mr. Melandro F. Soriano, pre-service teacher, served
               as the Science teacher.



                       During the two weeks of ALS classes, it was observed that the ALS students really]]></page><page Index="203"><![CDATA[enjoyed the classes based on the feedback evaluation given to them after every class. According

               to  one  of  the  students,  he  was  amazed  on  how  the  teachers  teach  the  lessons  and  their
               approaches to them. He had stopped because his high school teachers reprimanded him inside

               the class that led him to traumatic experience. Because of that, he refused to go to school and
               worked in a construction firm instead. But now, his perspective in life had changed because of

               the treatment of the faculty members they received. It is good to know that his program really

               changes the perspective of these former out-of-school youths.


                       The ALS students also experienced how to use computer through their digital literacy
               subject. They were also taught how to express themselves as some of them have very low self-

               esteem due to their level of education. Dr. Manarpiis taught them some tips on how to become
               a confident English language speaker.


                       The Extension Services Unit of the campus will ensure that they will provide the needs

               of the students in order for them to receive the quality of education they deserve.
