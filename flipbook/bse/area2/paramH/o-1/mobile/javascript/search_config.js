It also assessed the attainability and congruence of the VMGO to the educational                practices and activities of the said institution. It employed a descriptive research design using                a survey questionnaire administered using Google forms. A total of 794 internal and external                stakeholders participated in the study using snowball sampling to reach the stakeholders via                email and other social media sites before and during the pandemic. Data were tabulated and                analyzed using SPSS. Results show that all the internal and external stakeholders are highly                aware, moderately understood, and greatly accept the VMGO. Results also show that all the                internal and external stakeholders generally perceived that the VMGO is very clear, highly                attainable,  and  highly  relevant/congruent.  It  also  reveals  no  significant  differences  in  the                stakeholders' responses regarding their  perception  of the awareness, understanding,  clarity,                acceptance, attainability, and congruence to the educational practices, activities, projects, and                operations of CvSU. Thus, it is recommended that CvSU-Tanza Campus continue the widest                dissemination of the VMGO through various forms, conduct training for the stakeholders to                fully understand the VMGO, and encourage the stakeholders to take part in the realization of                the VMGO through quality instruction, research, and extension activities.

It articulates this vision by providing excellent, equitable, and                relevant  educational  opportunities  in  the  arts,  sciences,  and  technology  through  quality                instruction and responsive research and development activities. It shall produce professional,                skilled, and morally upright individuals for global competitiveness (Cavite State University,                2022).                 All academic units (i.e., colleges and campuses) within CvSU are required to have goals that                align with the University's vision and mission, and all programs within an academic unit are                required to have objectives that align with those goals.CvSU – Tanza Campus (TC), one of                 www.ijrehc.com                             Copyright © IJREHC 2022, All right reserved   Page 145","International Journal of Research in Education Humanities and Commerce                                                            Volume 03, Issue 05 \"September - October 2022\"                                                                                            ISSN 2583-0333                 its ten campuses, is no exemption as it aims to provide high-quality instruction to produce                skilled, morally upright, and globally competitive graduates; develop and pursue advanced                research activities through arts, sciences, and technology to support instruction; and develop                and  conduct  extension  activities  that  will  empower  people  and  communities.  Hence,  its                program offerings aim to produce graduates who can demonstrate competencies in their fields                of  specialization  or  chosen  careers  and  with  critical  and  creative  thinking  skills,  ethical                leadership, and morally upright values.                 CvSU  –  TC  continuously  seeks  accreditation  from  the  Accrediting  Agency  for  Chartered                Colleges  and  Universities  in  the  Philippines  (AACCUP)  for  its  different  programs.                Accreditation is a review procedure used to determine whether educational programs meet                specific  quality  standards.  Accreditation  is  not permanent.  After  being  granted, it  must  be                renewed periodically to ensure that the caliber of the educational program is maintained. It                culminates in an external quality review by a team of professional experts from the AACCUP                officials  and  senior  accreditors,  academic  program  specialists,  the  AACCUP  pool  of                institutional accreditors, and international experts (Corpuz, n.d). There are ten standards/key                result areas in all program accreditation instruments. The ultimate goal is to assess whether                the  institution  has  achieved  its  vision,  mission,  goals,  and  objectives  (VMGO)  through                relevant instruction, research, and extension activities.                 The efficacy of the VMGO depends on how it is disseminated and understood. To attain this,                the stakeholders of an educational institution have to be fully aware of its VMGO and fully                accept  its  implication  (Castillo,  2014).  Various  authors  have  assessed  the  awareness,                acceptability, and perception of CvSU  stakeholders towards its  VMGO  (Gomez  \& Basco,                2022; Cahapin,  Malabag, Samson,  \& Santiago, 2022). While these  studies  focused on  the                awareness, acceptability, and perception of CvSU stakeholders towards its VMGO, this study                has also assessed the stakeholders' perception of the CvSU-TC VMGO and its attainability                and  congruence  to  educational  activities  and  practices  aside  from  the  factors  mentioned                above.                 Perception  of  VMGO  means  how  the  stakeholders  are  aware  of  and  how  clear  they                understand and accept the CvSU-TC VMGO. Having clarity of perception about the VMGO                means having a clear view or understanding. Hence, if CvSU – TC stakeholders have high                clarity of perception towards its VMGO, it is tantamount to say that the vision and mission                statements are clearly defined, stated, and reflect what CvSU hopes to become in the future.                 On the other hand, having congruency between actual educational practices and activities and                the VMGO means that there is a clear consensus that VMGO were clearly defined and that                the processes and activities to achieve such are clear and in the correct order.                 In view of the preceding statements, this study was conducted to:                 1.

Determine  the  significant  differences  in  the  stakeholders'  perception  and  level  of                acceptance  towards  CvSU-TC  VMGO  and  its  attainability  and  congruence  to  educational                practices and activities.                  2.0 METHODOLOGY                 The  study  used  a  descriptive  research  method  to  determine  the  perception  and  level  of                acceptance  of  the  CvSU  stakeholders  towards  its  VMGO.  Likewise,  the  attainability  and                congruence  of  the  said  VMGO  to  the  educational  practices  and  activities  in  the  different                programs of CvSU-TC were also assessed.                 A stakeholder survey questionnaire via Google forms was used to gather data from a total of                794  stakeholders  consisting  of  91  alumna/alumnus,  79  community  members  or  extension                clientele, 29 administrators,  faculty  members and  staff, 23 industry linkage and/or partner                agencies,  128  parents  and/or  guardians,  and  444  students.  The  researchers  used  snowball                sampling to reach the stakeholders during the pandemic via any possible means (i.e., email                and/or social media sites).                 Data were tabulated and analyzed using SPSS. Descriptive statistics using weighted means                and  standard  deviations  were used to  determine the  perception (awareness, understanding,                clarity)  and  level  of  acceptance  of  CvSU-TC  stakeholders  towards  its  VMGO.  The  same                statistical tools were used to determine the extent of attainability and congruence of VMGO                to educational practices and activities. On the other hand, analysis of variance (ANOVA) was                used to determine if there are significant differences in the stakeholders' perception and level                of acceptance towards CvSU-TC VMGO and its attainability and congruence to educational                practices and activities when grouped according to the nature of stakeholders.                 The following scale and interpretation were used to better understand the quantitative data:                  Table 1.

The results                revealed that the internal stakeholders, administrators/faculty/staff, and students, are highly                aware of the VMGO of the campus. The integration of the VMGO in the course syllabi and                the  holding  of  students'  orientation  program  every  first  semester of the academic  year  are                some of the practices of the campus for proper information dissemination. In addition, the                posting of the VMGO especially in the classroom makes it accessible for the students to read                its content.                  The findings also revealed that the student stakeholders are highly aware that the \"VMGO are                displayed in bulletin boards\" but moderately aware that the \"VMGO are printed in brochures,                manuals, and other materials, are broadcast in media and/or internet/website, are posted in                social  media  sites  (Facebook,  Twitter,  etc.),  and  are  widely  disseminated  to  the  different                agencies,  institutions, industry  sector and the  community as a  whole\". The reason  for this                may be  that  bulletin boards are everywhere  on the campus and  can be  found inside  some                offices of the campus where students are allowed to enter.                 In addition, the administrators/faculty/staff stakeholders are highly aware that the \"VMGO                are  posted  in  social  media  sites  (Facebook,  Twitter,  etc.)\"  but  moderately  aware  that  the                \"VMGO  are  displayed  in  bulletin  boards,  are  printed  in  brochures,  manuals,  and  other                materials, and are widely disseminated to the different agencies, institutions, industry sector                and  the  community\". The reason  for this  may be  that  social  media are  more accessible to                administrators, faculty, and staff. Although administrators and faculty members are involved                in the formulation and revisions of VMGO and this was always integrated into the course                syllabi, the materials and location where they are available and located may not be visible to                them.                 Generally, the internal  stakeholders are  highly aware of CvSU's  VMGO  with the  students                having the highest mean of 3.41.                 Table 5.

Based on the findings, the following conclusions are drawn:                      1.  All the internal and external stakeholders are highly aware of the Vision and Mission                        of  CvSU,  Goals  and  the  Objectives  of  the  different  programs  of  CvSu  –  Tanza                        Campus.                    2.  All the internal and external stakeholders moderately understood all the statements in                        the   Vision and Mission of CvSU, Goals and the Objectives of the different programs                        of CvSu – Tanza Campus.                    3.  The  clarity  of  the  Vision  and  Mission  of  CvSU,  Goals  and  the  Objectives  of  the                        different programs of CvSu – Tanza Campus are very clear as perceived by all the                        internal and external stakeholders.                    4.  The Vision and Mission of CvSU, Goals and the Objectives of the different programs                        of CvSu  – Tanza Campus are  greatly accepted as perceived by all the internal and                        external stakeholders.                    5.  The Vision and Mission of CvSU, Goals and the Objectives of the different programs                        of CvSu – Tanza Campus are highly attainable as perceived by all the internal and                        external stakeholders.                    6.  The Vision and Mission of CvSU, Goals and the Objectives of the different programs                        of CvSu – Tanza Campus are highly relevant/congruent to the educational practices,                        activities,  projects,  and  operations  of  CvSU  as  perceived  by  all  the  internal  and                        external stakeholders.                    7.  All the responses among the internal and external  stakeholders have  no  significant                        difference  regarding  their  perception  on  the  awareness,  understanding,  clarity,                        acceptance,  attainability,  and  congruence  to  the  educational  practices,  activities,                        projects, and operations of CvSU.                 Based on the above conclusions, the following recommendations are made:                     1.  Tanza Campus should continue its practices in the widest dissemination of the VMGO                        through  various  forms  of  communication  media  and  ensure  that  it  is  properly                        disseminated to all areas that can reach all the stakeholders.                    2.  The campus should conduct a training on how the stakeholders will be able to fully                        understand all the statements behind the VMGO.                    3.  Activities  for instruction, research, and extension  should be  sustained  to  encourage                        the stakeholders to take part on the realization of the VMGO.

Because proper questioning techniques are important for the classroom, this study identified the                              Mathematics pre-service teachers’ classification of test items using the revised Bloom’s Taxonomy                              (rBT) and the Cunningham’s Levels of Questions (CLQs). It used a group of forty two pre-service                              Mathematics teachers who were asked to classify each thinking skills in the rBT as to LOT or HOT                              and then create test items falling under each category of the rBT and CLQ. Results revealed that                              most of the pre-service teachers have viewed LOT and HOT based on the level of difficulty of the                              given problem. They found it relatively easier to create test items using the Cunningham’s Levels                              of Questions, a non-familiar nomenclature for classifying test items, rather than the well-known                              Bloom’s  Taxonomy.  Pre-service  teachers  should  be  able  to  identify  and  classify  questions                              according to their cognitive purposes.                               Keywords: Revised Bloom’s Taxonomy, Cunningham’s Levels of questions, higher-order thinking                              skills (HOTS), lower-order thinking skills (LOTS), test items, pre-service Mathematics teachers                                                         INTRODUCTION                       Mathematics contributes directly to effective, intelligent living. Competencies with number relations are                   essential to every individual beginning at an early age and continuing through old age. Hence, numeracy and                   problem solving skills have been the focus of the present Mathematics instruction. However, Mathematics                   teaching has traditionally relied on factual recall and a focus on the use of standardized algorithms with little                   effort to teach or assess for higher-order thinking skills (Battista, 1994; Kulm, 1990) as cited by Thompson                   (2008). As a result, students generally learn Mathematics without being able to use their knowledge to solve                   problems in diverse or non-familiar situations. Furthermore, the result of the 2011 Trends in International                   Math and Science Study (TIMSS) with 46 participating countries is a dismal scenario where the Philippines                   emerged as third from the last both in Math and Science after South Africa and Morocco. Educational analysts                   believe that the performance of the Filipino students in the TIMSS indicates danger signal which do not augur                   well for the country’s attainment of its goals towards industrialization and economic development.                      Unfortunately,  the  blame  for  the  said  disappointing  scenario is  always  on  the  part of  the  teachers as                   ineffectiveness in instructional efforts results to the underachievement of students in Mathematics; and that                   ineffective instruction is a result of being an incompetent teacher. Thus, teachers of Mathematics have been                   spending more time and effort to find the best possible teaching strategy that could make their students learn.                   However, evaluation of Mathematics achievement yields the same poor results, if not worse.

Students of teachers who teach for both lower-order-thinking (LOT) and             higher-order-thinking outperform students whose teachers only teach for LOT. Thus, Mathematics teachers             should  have a  strong  conception  of  higher-order  thinking  and  sustain  it  as  an  integral  part  of  classroom             instruction and assessment. With this, students will be able to meaningfully apply methods and concepts to             situations previously unfamiliar to them. And because Bloom’s Taxonomy is a well-known model for teaching             critical thinking skills in any subject area, it is used as a guide in creating test items.                Also, based on the K – 12 Mathematics Curriculum Guide (2013), the twin goals of mathematics in the             basic education levels are critical thinking and problem solving. Critical thinking, according to Scriven and             Paul (1987) as cited in the 2013 Curriculum Guide, is the intellectually disciplined process of actively and             skillfully conceptualizing, applying, analyzing, synthesizing, and/or evaluating information gathered from, or             generated by, observation, experience, reflection, reasoning, or communication, as a guide to belief and action.             On the other hand, according to Polya (1945, 1962), mathematical problem solving is finding a way around a             difficulty, around an obstacle, and finding a solution to a problem that is unknown. These two goals are to be             achieved with organized and rigorous curriculum content, a well-defined set of high-level skills and processes,             desirable values and attitudes, and appropriate tools, taking into account the different contexts of Filipino             learners.                Critical  thinking  skills  have  become  a  generic  phase  used  to  encompass  many  processes  involved  in             learning and problem solving. Several reasons are often given for teaching thinking skills. One reason given             by Gough in 1997, which was affirmed by Nisbet and Schucksmith (2000), is that the world is changing rapidly             and critical thinking skill is the most important element in today’s information age.                Most countries like the Philippines are concerned with raising the educational standards throughout the             compulsory  school  years.  The  Department  of  Education (DepEd  Order  No.  33,  s.  2004)  has  set  minimum             desired learning competencies and mastery of the “basics” are exposed such as reading, writing, Mathematics             and Science. These basics maybe excellently taught, but these are not sufficient to meet the demands of the             labor market and active citizenship. It is now recognized that a broader range of competencies, redefined as             higher-order thinking skills (HOTS), are required because:                a.  The “banking theory” of knowledge based upon rote learning has been discredited as it is recognized                   that individuals cannot “store” sufficient knowledge in their memories for future use.                b.  Information is expanding at such a rate that individuals require transferable skills to allow them to                   address different problems in different contexts at different times through their lives.                c.  The  complexity  of  modern  jobs  requires  staff  who  demonstrates  comprehension  and  judgment  as                   participants in the generation of knowledge or processes.                d.  Modern society assumes active citizenship which requires individuals to assimilate information from                   multiple sources, determine its veracity and make judgments.                The cognitive skills developed by people in a society are profoundly influenced by the ways knowledge and             literacy are taught and used. Thinking skills are viewed as crucial for educated persons to cope with a rapidly             changing  world.  Many educators  believed  that  specific knowledge  will  not be  as  important  to  tomorrow’s             workers and citizens as to the ability to learn and make sense of new information.                According to Robinson (1997), if students are to function successfully in a highly technical society, then             they must be equipped with life-long learning and thinking skills necessary to acquire and process in an ever-             changing world. Moreover, Pascua (1991) mentioned that it is the higher-order thinking skills that enable an             individual to learn more, to apply Mathematics in other disciplines and to solve problems throughout life.                Bloom’s research as cited by Mergel in 1998, emphasized that in skill mastery, the teacher needs to focus             and develop the higher-order thinking of students. There is substantial evidence that directed and controlled             intervention  programs  can  improve  students’  abilities  to  give  more  original  and  unusual  solutions  to             Mathematical problems of higher level.                According to Balmaceda as cited by Laviña (2000), in the knowledge-based and technology-driven society             of the next millennium, creativity, analytical skills, logical reasoning and critical thinking will be of paramount             importance. These skills will be crucial in coping with the explosion of information and adapting to new and             changing demands and challenges. The development of higher-order thinking skills (HOTS) and strategies to             improve such has been  the focus of educators in recent years, partly in response to the challenges of the              2 / 10                                                                   http://www.iejme.com","INT ELECT J MATH ED                    emerging world. Higher-order thinking skills or what others refer to as critical thinking has emerged as a                   priority for secondary and college curricula in most subject areas.                      Since pre-service teachers were being developed to become successful in-service teachers, they were the                   focus of this study. Thus, Mathematics pre-service teachers must have a strong conception of critical thinking                   (higher-order thinking) and sustain it as an integral part of classroom instruction and assessment. With this,                   students will be able to meaningfully apply methods and concepts to situations previously unfamiliar to them.                   And because Bloom’s Taxonomy is a well-known model for teaching critical thinking skills in any subject area,                   it is used as a guide in creating test items.                                                  THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK                       Social  constructivism  is  the  primary  theoretical  framework  guiding  this  paper.  Social  constructivists                   believe social interaction, cultural tools, and activity shape individual development and learning (Resnick,                   1991; Tudge \& Scrimsher, 2003; Wertsch, 1991). Chin (2007) stated that in the classroom “knowledge was                   constructed through language and other semiotic means” (p. 816). If we take into consideration that much of                   this language takes place in the form of teachers asking questions (Levin \& Long, 1981), then the teachers’                   questions are an essential part of classroom discourse.                      Teacher’s  questions  represent  the  social  constructivist  concept  of  Scaffolding.  Scaffolding  refers  to  the                   assistance provided by more competent peers or adults (Wood, Bruner, \& Ross, 1976). Students do not explore                   the world in isolation. Therefore, student’s learning may be facilitated by parents or teachers who are usually                   more  knowledgeable  (Vygotsky,  1978).  During  the  classroom  discourse,  questions  can  be  used  as  a                   psychological  tool  that  mediates  students’  knowledge  construction  (Chin,  2007),  triggers  classroom                   interactions, and aids students in building content knowledge.                      In 1978, Vygotsky made a major contribution to the social constructivist theory. Vyogtsky (1978) added the                   Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) and defined ZPD as “the distance between the actual developmental                   level as determined by independent problem solving and the level of potential development as determined                   through problem solving under adult guidance or in collaboration with more capable peers” (p. 86). Based on                   this theory, teacher’s questions should be neither too easy nor too difficult and new knowledge should be built                   on student’s prior knowledge. The teacher needs to know the current developmental level of a student so that                   the question asked is appropriate and is located in the student’s ZPD. When students interact socially within                   their ZPD, students are more likely to discover new knowledge and bridge the new knowledge with prior                   knowledge (Schunk, 2007). In other words asking a confused student a higher cognitive question will not help                   the  student  with  knowledge  construction  because  the  question  is  not  in  the  student’s  ZPD.  Asking  an                   appropriate follow-up question is more likely to facilitate connections between previous knowledge and the                   current question. Feedback should enhance the questions teachers ask and the subject being studied and                   should be asked in such a way that it guides student learning. Moreover, feedback must direct attention to                   the intended learning, point out strengths and offer specific information for improvement, be timely and occur                   during the learning, address partial understanding, and limit the corrective information to advice the student                   can act on (Chappuis, 2009). Effective feedback is important because it is specifically related to achievement                   no matter the grade level, race, or socioeconomic status (Bellon, Bellon, \& Blank, 1991). Vygotsky’s ZPD theory                   and the social constructivist theory provide us with a lens through which we may identify the importance of                   follow-up questions and feedback.                      A question is defined as an utterance that is posed in the form of an interrogation or has a grammatical                   form which seeks to find out some information about a student’s knowledge or thinking (Chin, 2007). Socrates                   recognized the importance of questioning as early as the fifth century BC (Ellis, 1993; Harrop \& Swinson,                   2003; Overholser, 1992). When Socrates taught he did not answer students’ questions by providing direct                   answers (Moore \& Rudd, 2002), instead he posed further questions to place the responsibility of thinking on                   the students. This technique became known as the Socratic Method and required students to be active thinkers                   rather than passive listeners. The Socratic Method of questioning seldom requests factual information, but                   persuades  and  permits  students  to  express  their  opinions  and  explore  the  rationale  for  their  responses                   (Overholser, 1992). Questioning should challenge students to think critically and creatively (Ellis, 1993; Wilen,                   1991), stimulate student participation, arouses student interest (Wilen, 1991), identify student abilities (Ellis,                   1993; Wilen, 1991) and misconceptions, confirm students’ understanding of the material being taught.                      Even though the Socratic Method of questioning is a successful model and questioning is widely used in                   the classroom, the cognitive level and the purpose of questions teachers ask indicate that classroom teachers                     http://www.iejme.com                                                                  3 / 10","Sebastian              Table 1.

There are three reasons why questioning by classroom teachers             is failing to meet the rigor of the Socratic Method. First, the majority of the questions teachers ask in the             classroom  are  lower  level  questions  that  emphasize  rote  memory  and  recall  of  factual  information             (Cunningham, 1987; Gall, 1984; Myhill \& Dunkin, 2005; Wilen, 1991). A study conducted by Pate and Bremer             (1967) revealed that most teachers regarded questioning as a means to check student understanding, diagnose             misconceptions,  and  urge  students  to  recall  specific  facts.  Ten  percent  of  the  participants  mentioned             generalizing and making inferences. However, teachers’ questions should go far beyond memorizing. Teachers             should  understand  that  authentic  thoughts  are  stimulated  by  questions  that  require  making  inferences,             drawing conclusions, and creating meaning (Elder \& Paul, 1998).                Most K-12 teachers are familiar with Bloom’s Taxonomy as a scaffold for questioning, but few have had             substantive training in their teacher education courses that included effective questioning based on Bloom’s             Taxonomy (Hannel, 2009). Being aware of Bloom’s Taxonomy is not enough to persuade classroom teachers to             design  questions  based  on  the  six  levels  within  the  cognitive  domain.  Moreover,  pre-service  elementary             mathematics teachers struggle when listening to and responding to students (Nicol, 1999). Therefore, today’s             pre-service teacher education courses cannot focus solely on posing questions. Teacher educators must pay             equal attention to questioning skills with regard to posing, listening, and responding to students. Because             posing  questions  without  listening  and  responding  to  students  does  not  build  a  constructive  discussion,             teachers  must  listen  to  students,  make  sense  of  students’  answers  and  questions,  and  identify  students’             understanding of the questions posed in order to provide constructive feedback or ask constructive follow-up             questions. Questioning should be a two-way interaction between teachers/students and students/students. The             categorization of questions and the respective theorists/researchers is summarized and may be reviewed in             Table 1.                Bloom’s  Taxonomy  (or  its  revision),  Sander’s  Taxonomy  and  Cunningham’s  Five  Levels  of  Questions             provide teacher educators with examples of levels of questioning. Bloom’s Taxonomy (Bloom et al., 1956) is             the  most  popular  and  has  been  used  to  categorize  questions  into  hierarchical  cognitive  levels.  Bloom’s             Taxonomy divides learning objectives into three domains: cognitive, affective, and psychomotor. The cognitive             domain includes six hierarchical categories: knowledge, comprehension, application, analysis, synthesis, and             evaluation.  Knowledge is  the  lowest  cognitive  level  and  evaluation is  considered  the  most  complex.  Each             category of the cognitive domain is associated with specific verbs, which  may be used to phrase learning             objectives  and  questions.  Sanders’  Taxonomy  (1966)  divides  cognition  into  seven  hierarchical  categories:             memory, translation, interpretation, application, analysis, synthesis, and evaluation.                Bloom’s and Sanders’ Taxonomies are based on the verbs that describe learning objectives and have been             criticized for being too narrow to allow for an accurate measurement of each level (Riegle, 1976).

Low-divergent   Requires students to find alternative solutions.   How can we use square tiles to build a                      question                                            different rectangle with the same perimeter?                   5.  High-divergent  Promotes creative thinking.        How can we build the largest house with                      question                                            limited materials?                    Gall (1970) claimed that “a weakness of the cognitive-process approach to question classification is that these                   processes are inferential constructs” (p.710) that cannot be directly observed.                      Zhang and Patrick (2012) proposed the use of Cunningham’s Five Levels of Questions (1987) as a better                   choice for observable and measurable categorizing of questions (Table  2). The lowest level of questioning                   emphasizes rote memory and the answer to the question is predictable. The middle level of questioning is                   convergent and is divided into low and high levels. Low-convergent questions require students to put facts                   together  and  construct  a  response  using  comparing,  contrasting,  generalizing,  transferring  form,  or                   explaining.  High-convergent  questions  require  students  to  look  for  evidence  to  support  the  answer,  give                   reasons for behaviors or outcomes, and draw conclusions. However, teachers also look for specific answers at                   this level. The highest level is composed of divergent questions that and are divided into low and high levels.                   Divergent questions are usually open-ended. Low-divergent questions require students to find alternative                   solutions. High-divergent questions promote creative thinking.                                                      RESEARCH QUESTIONS                      This study attempted to determine the classification of test items written by Mathematics pre-service                   teachers using the revised Bloom’s Taxonomy and the Cunningham’s Level of Questions. Specifically, it aimed                   to answer the following questions:                      a.  What  is  the  description  of  the  Mathematics  pre-service  teachers  in  terms  of  their  academic                         achievement?                      b.  How do Mathematics pre-service teachers describe lower- and higher-order thinking skills?                      c.  Which questions written by mathematics pre-service teachers were representative of:                         •  each thinking skill in the Bloom’s Taxonomy?                         •  each level in the Cunningham’s Taxonomy?                      d.  Which  taxonomy  is  easier  to  use  in  preparing  test  items  as  perceived  by  mathematics  pre-service                         teachers?                                                         METHODOLOGY                       The participants of the study were composed of 42 mathematics pre-service teachers (MPSTs) from two                   selected universities in Cavite. Their GPAs in the content and professional courses that were already taken                   were gathered. The MPSTs were asked to describe lower- and higher-order thinking. When testing for levels                   of thinking, it is important that teachers should note the familiarity to the problem situation (Thompson,                   2008). It is considered as HOT if the problem situation is new, unfamiliar, or in some way different from those                   used in the instruction. Otherwise, it is deemed LOT.                      Pre-service teachers were then asked to classify each thinking skill in Bloom’s Taxonomy as either LOT or                   HOT. Lastly, they were asked to construct a Geometry examination item for each thinking skill in the RBT                   and CLQ. Since the latter is not familiar with the PSTs, the researcher explained each level and provided                   them with a handout that consists of the characteristics and examples of each question level. Once they were                   comfortable with the CLQ, they proceeded to writing test items.                      http://www.iejme.com                                                                  5 / 10","Sebastian              Table 3.

Three  consultants were  asked  to  classify  and  validate each  test  item             independent of the researcher to break disagreements on classification.                                                       RESULTS                Of the twenty 42 participating Mathematics pre-service teachers, seventy four percent of them indicated             that they were either very familiar (14%) or somewhat familiar (60%) with Bloom’s Taxonomy (BT); but none             of them indicated familiarity with Cunningham’s Levels of Questions. Some of these pre-service teachers also             indicated that they had learned BT during their undergraduate courses as part of their curricular program.             Others have learned it also through researches and seminars they had attended.                 Research Question No. 1: What is the Description of the Mathematics Pre-service                                Teachers in terms of their Academic Achievement?                MPSTs’ final grades in content and professional courses were gathered by computing their GPAs (see             Table 3). Dominantly, student’s achievements in specialization content courses and professional education             courses are interpreted as very satisfactory that falls under 1.76 to 2.00.                Based on these, it is expected that each pre-service teacher is well-versed in writing test items since their             content and professional knowledge are both very satisfactory which are both very essential to students taking             teacher education program.               Research Question No. 2: How do Mathematics Pre-service Teachers Describe Lower-                                          and Higher-order Thinking Skills?                 Some pre-service teachers included as part of their characterizations of LOT or HOT the level of difficulty             of the given problem – as to simple or complex processes involved. Several pre-service teachers wrote that LOT             problems are easier than HOT problems – they involve logical and critical thinking as well as careful analysis             of the given problem.                Furthermore, a few pre-service teachers had mentioned that LOT requires simple recall of information and             that  these  information  are  too  basic  and  based  only  on  rote  memory,  whereas,  HOT  as  mentioned  is  a             challenging tool in teaching and learning Mathematics because it enhances the creativity of the students in             solving  given  problems.  However,  they  fail  to  characterize  LOT  or  HOT  problems  based  on  students’             familiarity to the given problem.                On the other hand, pre-service teachers were asked to classify each thinking skill in the Bloom’s Taxonomy             as either LOT or HOT. The results are presented in Table 4.                Teachers’  classification  of  thinking  skills  indicated  that  100%  of  the  teachers  correctly  classified             remembering as to LOT; analyzing and creating as to HOT. Over 75% of the teachers classified understanding             correctly as LOT. Applying is considered LOT or HOT in the revised Bloom’s Taxonomy.

Research Question No. 3: What are the Categories of Questions Developed by the Pre-                      service Teachers in terms of the Revised Bloom’s Taxonomy and the Cunningham’s                                                      Level of Questions?                      Out of 243 test items that were developed under the RBT presented in Table 5, a little more than half                   (53.50%)  were  correctly  classified  according  to  Bloom’s  Taxonomy.  The  remembering  and  application                   categories both received the highest percentage of correct classifications (70%) followed by understanding                   skills (60%). Test items under creating skills had the lowest percentage (21.05%).                      Out of 194 test items that were developed under the CLQ presented in Table 6, more than 75% were                   correctly classified according to Cunninghams’ Level of Questions. The high convergent, low convergent and                   high divergent questions all received a remarkable percentage of correct classifications.                      In the analysis of test items written, it is noticeable that common higher-level items were those that will                   require students to construct and/or criticize proofs given some conditions of the problems, without really                   establishing their familiarity with the problem. Another is that teachers were likely to categorize as HOT                   those items that will require students to solve complex procedures where in fact, the procedure has been taught                   to the students before but is not implied on the problem the solution to be used. Some teachers had interpreted                   evaluating items as “finding the value of” where in fact; test items within this category must be considered                   application items. Several pre-service teachers commented that although the test items were familiar to the                   students, there is still a need to analyze the problems, identify and combine theorems and postulates and their                   relations to the condition stated in order to arrive at the conclusion. Hence, despite the pre-service teachers’                   familiarity with the Bloom’s Taxonomy, this did not help much in the construction of the test items that are                   appropriate to their classifications of thinking skills.                      Surprisingly, despite that all of the MPSTs were not familiar with Cunningham’s Levels of Questions, they                   successfully wrote test items falling in each category under this classification.                     Research Question No. 4: Which Taxonomy is Easier to Use in Preparing Test Items as                                       Perceived by Mathematics Pre-service Teachers?                       In classification of test items, it is interesting to note that MPSTs could develop and classify test items                   more  correctly  in  terms  of  the  Cunninghams’  (85.57%)  rather  than  Bloom’s  Taxonomy  (53.50%).

Table 7             presents the results of t-test of difference between two proportions.                Comparison of correct classification of test items using RBT and CLQ indicates that there is significant             difference in the way mathematics pre-service teachers classify test items, Z = -7.978, p < 0.05. This indicates             that  MPSTs  relatively  find  it  easier  to  write  test  items  using  Cunningham’s  Levels  of  Question,  a  new             nomenclature for them, rather than the revised Bloom’s Taxonomy, a very quite familiar nomenclature in             classifying test items in cognitive levels.                                                    CONCLUSIONS                Mathematics pre-service teachers have very satisfactory academic achievement which help them in writing             test items. In teaching for HOT in Mathematics, pre-service teachers disregarded the concept of familiarity of             the student to the situation presented to them. What they thought of was that LOT items were easier to             answer and/or solve than HOT items. Most of the pre-service teachers found it difficult to construct test items             that fit in the thinking skill described in Bloom’s Taxonomy, especially those at the evaluating and creating             levels. Teachers also overestimate those “complex problems” and regarded them as HOT where in fact, they             are considered as LOT. Also, they tend to underestimate those LOT items which require student to recall             theorems and concepts without anticipating that the problems need to be analyzed in order to come up with             such theorems. It is interesting to note that although they were not familiar with Cunningham’s Levels of             Questions, they successfully wrote test items under each category.                To support pre-service teachers in promoting classroom interactions through higher-level questioning, pre-             service teachers should be aware of the types of questions that encourage higher level thinking. They should             be able to identify and classify questions according to their cognitive purposes such as lower level knowledge             questions and higher-level evaluation questions. And so, the researcher recommends the use of Cunningham’s             Levels of Questions first in categorizing test items since most of the pre-service teachers could easily create             test  items  under  this  classification.  However,  it  is  not  suggested  that  the  use  of  Bloom’s  taxonomy  be             eliminated in the curriculum as this is essential in classifying questions in the cognitive level. They should go             hand  in  hand  to  better  equip  pre-service  teachers  with  adequate  knowledge  in  promoting  classroom             interactions through higher-level questioning.

This study examined achievement motivation, locus of control and study habits as predictors of                                   mathematics  achievement  of  freshman  students  taking  non-board  examination  programs  at  a  certain  state                                   university in Southern Luzon, Philippines. In this descriptive-correlational research design, purposive sampling                                   technique was used to select 258 participants enrolled in the subject mathematics in the Modern World. Four sets                                   of research instruments were used for the data collection: namely, mathematics Achievement Motivation Scale,                                   Locus of Control Scale, mathematics Study Habits Inventory and the teacher-made mathematics Achievement                                   Test. The results showed that most students have average achievement motivation, internal locus of control,                                   desirable  study  habits  and  average  mathematics  achievement.  The  results  also  revealed  that  there  was  a                                   significant  relationship  between  achievement  motivation  and  mathematics  achievement  and  achievement                                   motivation was found to be the only predictor of mathematics achievement. This indicates that achievement                                   motivation is effective in enhancing mathematics achievement. Students’ achievement motivation will increase                                   to high level if given the right remediation. Hence, high achievement motivation can predict high mathematics                                   achievement.                                   Keywords:  mathematics  achievement,  achievement  motivation,  locus  of  control,  internal  locus  of  control,                                   external locus of control, study habits               INTRODUCTION                  Having a solid foundation of mathematics subject is having the ability to think critically and solve problems creatively; and             this ability is necessary for success in life. However, learning mathematics is not easy for most Filipino students as they were found             to have difficulty in understanding mathematics lessons that require higher order thinking skills (Patena \& Dinglasan, 2013). Even             college students are not excluded from the problem in learning and mastering mathematics and this is visible in the students’ low             performance in mathematics test (Andaya, 2014). Obiero (2018) observed that poor mathematics achievement has been a concern             worldwide despite the actual studies that have been done on certain factors which have been recognized as possible contributors             to mathematics achievement. Poor mathematics achievement is a learning disability and major cause of failure in school (Dela             Cruz, 2018). So, it is necessary to identify the factors that may affect mathematics achievement of the students for the teachers             and the administrators to find solution for improvement.                Various researchers have explored many factors which are found responsible for success or failure in mathematics and some             of these include achievement motivation, locus of control and study habits. On one hand, achievement motivation plays a very             important role in the teaching and learning process (Hasan \& Sarkar, 2018) as it is described as a student’s inner drive to achieve             and if that student lacks that desire to achieve, the academic performance will be affected. On the other hand, locus of control             plays an important role in learning motivation and in the development of a person, which could affect the achievement of students             (Nongtdu \& Bhutia, 2017). According to Choudhury and Borooah (2017), locus of control is a student’s personality and his belief in             the causes of his success or failure in academics and can be classified as either internal or external. Students with internal locus             of control believe that the causes of their success or failure is a result of their own efforts and abilities; while students with external             locus of control believe that factors like luck, task difficulty or other people’s action often result to their success or failure (Gujjar             \& Aijaz, 2014). Atetwe et al. (2018) found out that an internal locus of control predicts high mathematics achievement.                Furthermore, students’ study habits play a vital role in reflecting the standard of education and the students’ mathematics             achievement (Odiri, 2015). According to Sharma and Vyas (2016), study habits refer to the way of exercising students’ abilities in              Copyright © 2021 by Author/s and Licensed by Modestum.

The general belief is that students who exercise good study habits are expected to excel than those with             bad study habits (Arora, 2016). Improving achievement motivation and study habits (Daniel, 2015) and internal locus of control             (Atetwe et al., 2018) among students may enhance their mathematics achievement. Thus, it is important to determine whether             these variables could predict students’ mathematics achievement so that necessary intervention programs can be recommended.                As such, the researcher attempted to determine whether achievement  motivation, locus of control and study habits are             predictors of mathematics achievement of college students enrolled in non-board examination programs under tourism and             hospitality management and business management taking the subject mathematics in the Modern World during the first semester             of the academic year 2019 - 2020 at a certain state university in Southern Luzon, Philippines. To achieve this, the following research             questions were set:                1.  What is the profile of the students in terms of achievement motivation, locus of control, study habits and mathematics                   achievement?                2.  Is there a significant relationship between student’s mathematics achievement and achievement motivation, locus of                   control, and study habits?                3.  To  what  extent  do  students’  achievement  motivation,  locus  of  control  and  study  habits  predict  their  mathematics                   achievement?               LITERATURE REVIEW                  The  importance  of  achievement  motivation,  locus  of  control  and  study  habits  in  the  teaching  and  learning  process  is             emphasized in most studies. Each of these factors can predict mathematics achievement as seen in the results of the studies             conducted  about  achievement  motivation,  locus  of  control  and  study  habits.  Students  were  found  to  possess  high  level  of             achievement motivation, internal locus of control and good study habits.             Achievement Motivation                In a study of the way how people satisfy their needs, American psychologist David McClelland concluded that people have             motivating drivers that are directly linked to their needs regardless of age, gender, culture and race (Mulder 2015). One of these,             based  on  McClelland’s  Human  Motivation  Theory,  is  the  need  for  achievement  or  achievement  motivation.  Achievement             motivation is defined by McClelland as the positive and negative effects that arose in situations involving certain standards of             excellence where performance in such situations can be assessed as success or failure (Daniel, 2015). It is an inner drive that             motivates  the  students  to  achieve  a  particular  goal  (Kaur,  2017).  When  students  are  motivated  to  perform  competently  on             academic tasks, they will learn according to their abilities; hence, learning of the students is maximized when their achievement             motivation is enhanced (Yazdani \& Godbole, 2014).             Locus of Control                The concept of locus of control was formulated by psychologist Julian B. Rotter in 1954 and referred it as a dimension of             personality which helps explain one’s traits and behaviors (Choudhury \& Borooah, 2017). Locus of control is a variable which refers             to an individual’s belief about the causes of the good or bad result in his or her life, either in general or in specific area such as in             academics (Kumar \& Asha, 2017). According to Curtis and Trice (2013), Rotter defined locus of control as a set of stable beliefs that             predict performance in achievement contexts and can be conceptualized as either internal or external (Mathur, 2014). A person             with internal locus of control believe that their ability and effort are essential for achievement and can be used to assess the causes             of success or failure of individuals; while those with an external locus of control view luck, chance, the influence of powerful others             (such as teachers), and the difficulty of the task as the primary factors determining success or failure. Ashton D. Trice developed             the Academic Locus of Control Scale in 1985 specifically designed for college students and conducted a study together with             Nicholas A. Curtis regarding its revisions in 2013. In their study, four factors were found within the Academic Locus of Control             namely, hopelessness, distractibility, poor student attitude and impaired planning. It was suggested that seven items from the             original scale which did not load on these four factors should be removed.             Study Habits                Study habits refer to the way of studying in whatever manner, whether systematic or unsystematic, efficient or otherwise             (Sharma \& Vyas, 2016). Student’s study habits differ from one another. Some study habits are considered to be more desirable             than others from the view of academic achievement (Arora, 2016). Although variations exist among the students, there are some             good study habits that will lead to academic achievement. Good study habits are the practices that could improve students’             concentration, remembering, organizing time, studying, listening and taking notes, taking tests and motivation (Llavore et al.,             (2015). Prof. M.N. Palsane and Sadhna Sharma constructed a study habit inventory composed of eight different domains. The eight             domains of the study habits include (1) time management, (2) physical status, (3) note-taking, (4) testing strategies, (5) learning             motivation, (6) reading ability, (7) memory and (8) health. This was the basis of the adaptation of the Study Habits questionnaire.             Mathematics Achievement                Academic achievement is defined as a measure of knowledge, understanding or skills in a specific subject or a group of subjects             and can be described as a successful accomplishment in a particular subject area (Verma, 2016). Mathematics is an academic             discipline that has a very important application in science and technology (Singh, 2015), and Charles-Ogan and Alamina (2014)","Villa \& Sebastian / INT ELECT J MATH ED, 16(3), em0661      3 / 16              noted that having a strong background in mathematics is crucial for many careers and job opportunities in today’s technological             society. However, despite its usefulness and importance, it is still perceived by the students as difficult, boring, abstract, and that             achievement in mathematics requires a special ability (Daniel, 2015). Dela Cruz (2018) stated that poor academic achievement in             mathematics is a learning disability for Filipinos and a major cause of failure in academics. Thus, it is necessary to observe the             teaching and learning process in mathematics so that this important subject is fully presented to the students and that they may             have a great interest and more achievements in the subject (Singh, 2015).             Achievement Motivation and Mathematics Achievement                Sahayarani and Stanley (2017) found out that the level of achievement motivation of the students was above average and             showed a high positive correlation with achievement in mathematics. In addition, Sarangi (2015) determined the relationship             between achievement motivation and academic achievement on the basis of community, locale and sex. The study revealed a             significant relationship between achievement motivation and academic achievement in the case of non-tribal, female, and rural             and urban students while a no significant relationship existed between tribal and male students. In contrast, the study of Hasan             and  Sarkar  (2018)  showed  a  non-significant  correlation  between  achievement  motivation  and  academic  achievement  of  the             students.  Furthermore,  Obiero  (2018)  found  a  positive  but  weak  and  none  significant  relationship  between  achievement             motivation and mathematics achievement of the students.              Locus of Control and Mathematics Achievement                Several factors may contribute to academic achievement, but locus of control is one variable that has been overlooked and             can be studied and reviewed as an important indicator in predicting academic success and failure of the students (Anakwe, 2018).             Gujjar and Aijaz (2014) stated that locus is a personal belief about who can control the consequences of a student’s action, referring             to success and failure in academics. Mathur (2014) revealed that college students with an internal locus of control can be expected             to perform better in their academics and also have a positive attitude towards life whereas the ones with an external locus of             control are not expected to perform well as the previous one. Raheem and Abdulkadir (2018) found that if a person with an internal             locus of control does not perform well in a test, he would blame it on lack of preparedness on his part and if he performed well in             a test, he would attribute this to his ability to study. On the other hand, if a person with a high external locus of control does poorly             in a test, he might attribute this to the difficulty of the test questions and if he performed well in it, he might think the teacher was             lenient or that he was lucky. Since the student is the one responsible for the consequence of his or her success or failure in             academics, Nongtdu and Bhutia (2017) concluded that internal locus of control should be encouraged among students so they             would work harder for their own progress.                Choudhury and Borooah (2017) found no significant correlation between external locus of control and academic achievement,             which indicates that external locus of control did not influence the academic achievement of the students. On the other hand,             Atetwe et al. (2018) found that there was statistically significant correlation between internal locus of control and mathematics             achievement and that high level of internal locus of control was associated with high mathematics achievement. Atetwe et al. also             added that a variety of learning strategies should be used that would encourage students to improve their internal locus of control             and make them realized that they have more control over their mathematics achievement and this would enable the students to             take responsibility of their learning and have a possible high achievement in mathematics (2018).              Study Habits and Mathematics Achievement                Moreover, Sharma and Vyas (2016) stated that good study habits will result in good academic achievement whereas bad study             habit will result in a poor academic achievement. Specifically, good study habits lead to better mathematics achievement and             lack  of  good  study  habits  results  in  poor  mathematics  achievement  (Odiri,  2015).  Hence,  teachers  should  provide  ways  in             improving the student’s study  habits by capitalizing on  the  student’s strengths and work on their weaknesses by preparing             activities that match their cognitive abilities and time for independent learning must be used properly to increase mathematics             achievement (Dela Cruz, 2018). However, Arora (2016) revealed that proper study habits should be taught at the early stage of the             students and efforts should be made both by parents and the school authorities to provide suitable environment to develop good             study habits among the students to stop academic failure. Therefore, it can be said that learning how to study or to develop good             study habits is a lifelong process, and one should be ready to modify one’s method of study according to the need of time             (Lawrence, 2014).             Achievement Motivation, Study Habits and Mathematics Achievement                Knowing the possible influences of many factors in the academic achievement of the students yet hard to identify and analyze             all factors, Suresh (2015) conducted a study to find its influences to selected factors like achievement motivation and study habits             of the students. It was found out that academic achievement was highly influenced by achievement motivation compared to study             habits.  Particularly,  achievement  motivation  made  the  most  significant  contribution  to  the  prediction  of  mathematics             achievement followed by study habits (Daniel, 2015). Yazdani and Godbole (2014) concluded in their study that achievement             motivation  and  study  habits  and  its  eight  domains  of  time  management,  physical  status,  study  aids/note-taking,  learning             motivation, testing strategies, reading ability, memory and health are said to be effective in helping the students gain better             performance and academic achievement. Thus, Kaur (2017) stated that academic achievement can be improved by having proper             achievement motivation and improving good study habits.","4 / 16                           Villa \& Sebastian / INT ELECT J MATH ED, 16(3), em0661              Table 1.

Three independent variables namely, achievement motivation,             locus of control and study habits were used to determine whether they were predictors of mathematics achievement of college             students taking non-board examination programs. A total of 258 students who were enrolled in Bachelor of Science in Tourism             Management, Bachelor of Science in Hospitality Management and Bachelor of Science in Business Management, all of which are             non-board examination programs were purposively selected to participate in the study. The participants were enrolled in the             course mathematics in the Modern World during the first semester of the academic year 2019-2020 at a certain state university in             Southern Luzon, Philippines.                The researcher used four (4) research instruments in collecting data for the study. First, the researcher used the mathematics             Achievement  Motivation  Scale  to  measure  the  achievement  motivation  of  the  students.  It  was  adapted  from  Achievement             Motivation Scale by Prathibha Deo and Asha Mohan (2002) originally with a total item of 50. Some of the items were modified to             suit the student’s achievement motivation in mathematics and 7 items were removed because they are not related to the study.             The questionnaire used in this study consisted of 42 items covering description of the items such as academic motivation, need             for achievement, academic challenge, achievement anxiety, importance of grades, meaningfulness of task, relevance of college             to future goals, attitude towards education, work methods, attitude towards teachers, interpersonal relations, individual concern             and general interests. The scale was validated by three experts in the fields of education and psychology. After validation, it was             pilot-tested among 35 students who were not part of the population under study. It has a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.784 which is             greater than the minimum acceptable requirement of 0.70 (George \& Mallery, 2003).                The second instrument is the Locus of Control Scale, which was used to measure the locus of control of the students. This was             adapted from Ashton D. Trice’s Revised Academic Locus of Control Scale (2013). Some items were modified to fit the student’s             locus of control in mathematics. The questionnaires consisted of 21 items and each item consisted of true or false responses. It             was also pilot-tested to another group of 35 students who were not part of the population under study. The computed Cronbach’s             alpha for the data gathered is 0.725.                The third instrument, the mathematics Study Habits Inventory, was used to measure the study habits of the students. It was             adapted from Study Habits Inventory by M. N. Palsane and Sadhna Sharma (1989), which was originally a 45-item test. There were             items on study habits that were modified and others were removed because the questions were not related to the study. The final             instrument consisted of 37 items which measured the students’ study habits in terms of time management, physical status, study             aids/note taking, motivation, testing strategies, reading ability, memory, and health and was validated by three experts in the field             of education and psychology. It was also pilot-tested to another set of 35 students who were not part of the population under             study. The computed Cronbach’s alpha for the data is 0.705.                Finally, a teacher-made test was constructed to determine the mathematics achievement of the students and was validated             by three experts. This consisted of 40-item multiple choice type test. The coverage of the exam included topics based on the             mathematics in the Modern World taken by the students. The topics included Patterns and Numbers in Nature, Mathematical             Languages and Symbols, Problem Solving and Reasoning and Data Management.                Permit to conduct the study was first secured from the Office of the Administrator of the state university. After gathering the             total number of first year students enrolled in non-board courses, the researcher proceeded to the distribution of the four different             questionnaires. The researcher was accompanied by a psychometrician in administering the tests for two consecutive days except             for mathematics Achievement Test.              RESULTS               Student’s Profile                Majority of the students have average achievement motivation, internal locus of control, desirable study habits and average             mathematics achievement. The results are presented in Table 1.                The average achievement motivation of the freshman students obtained was similar to the result of the studies conducted by             Chetri  (2014),  Sarangi  (2015),  Roy  (2015)  and  Rani  and  Reddy (2019).  It  indicates  that  with  little  guidance  from  the  teacher,","Villa \& Sebastian / INT ELECT J MATH ED, 16(3), em0661      5 / 16              Table 2.

Hence, achievement motivation of the student can greatly             contribute to his or her academic performance.                First  year  students  were  found  to  have  internal  locus  of  control.  The  findings  of  the  studies  of  Gujjar  and  Aijaz  (2014),             Mashayekhi et al. (2014) and Mohamed et al. (2018) were similar to this study which found that majority of the college students             possessed an internal locus of control. The internal locus of control of the students is significantly associated with good academic             performance while external locus of control is related to low academic performance (Khir et al., 2015). Thus, having an internal             locus of control indicates that students can be expected to perform better in their academics given adequate feedbacks.                For  students’  study  habits,  the  obtained  desirable  study  habits  were  measured  in  terms  of  the  eight  domains  of  time             management, physical status, study aids/note taking, testing strategies, learning motivation, reading ability memory and health.             However, in terms of each domain, only the reading ability, memory and health gained undesirable study habits. This indicates             that students did not manifest fondness in reading or may have difficulties in understanding the meaning of some words. Students             also found it hard to remember the reviewed materials and experienced disappointments in the outcome of the examination.                A desirable study habit is a good study habit. Students who have good study habits are organized, keeping good notes, reading             textbooks, listening in class, and coming to class every day (Verma, 2016). Charles-Ogan and Alamina (2014) also found out in their             study that majority of the students have good study habits. Odiri (2015) revealed that good study habits lead to better achievement             in mathematics.                As for the students’ mathematics achievement, the result conforms to the statement of Kushwaha (2014) that in considering a             group of students, a large number of students always appeared as average achievers while only few students are found to be high             and low achievers.             Significant Relationship between Mathematics Achievement and its Predictors                Educators are increasingly recognizing the importance of improving students’ mathematics achievement. With this in mind,             the researcher focused on the factors which might be influential to this achievement by conducting both the bivariate correlation             (Table 2) and the multiple linear regressions.                Mathematics achievement is positively influenced by a certain variable. Based on Table 6, significant correlations (p = 0.05)             exist between the students’ mathematics achievement and its predictor, achievement motivation (r=0.205). The result of this             study is similar to the findings of the study of Sahayarani and Stanley (2017) which revealed that there existed a significant             relationship  between  achievement  motivation  and  mathematics  achievement.  This  implies  that  if  a  student’s  motivation  is             improved, the mathematics achievement can also be improved. Once a student is motivated in reaching goals in life, he/she can             achieve more success as he/she will do everything to reach this goal.                However, locus of control and study habits had no significant relationship to the students’ mathematics achievement. This             study contradicts the findings of the studies conducted by Atetwe et al. (2018) about locus of control and Charles-Ogan Alamina             (2014),  and  Odiri  (2015)  about  study  habits.  The  reason  for  the  non-significance  maybe  the  difficulty  in  understanding             mathematics lessons for some students. Although they possess an internal locus of control and desirable study habits, there is             still a possibility to fail in the subject. The three domains of study habits in terms of reading ability, memory and health which are             undesirable study habits of the students may also be the reason of the non-significant relationship.                Taken altogether, these three predictors may also affect mathematics achievement. The researcher is interested in finding a             model that would best describe a students’ mathematics achievement in terms of the predictors used. Multiple linear regressions             were used in running the test. However, three iteration processes were done to obtain the desired results. Variables that are not             predictors of mathematics achievement were removed for each process. Then, the test was used repeatedly to determine the most             significant variable. Final results are presented in Table 3.                Table 3 shows that the regression equation model with unstandardized beta value is     =  0.0622   1  +  9.6017, where    as             the  dependent  variable  is  the  mathematics  achievement  and    1  as  the  independent  variable  is  the  score  in  achievement             motivation. For instance, if a student’s score value in achievement motivation is 83, the expected mathematics achievement is             14.7643.                The result revealed that for the predictor of mathematics achievement, it can be seen that only achievement motivation             contributed positively to the students’ mathematics achievement as evident in the beta coefficients of 0.0622 (p-value = 0.05). This             further  means  that  for  every  unit  increase  in  the  mathematics  achievement  is  due  to  0.0622  unit  change  of  achievement             motivation.","6 / 16                           Villa \& Sebastian / INT ELECT J MATH ED, 16(3), em0661                 The result also indicates that highly motivated students achieve higher in mathematics achievement. This conforms to the             statement  of  Daniel  (2015)  that  the  more  the  students  are  motivated,  the  higher  is  their  mathematics  achievement.  Hence,             mathematics achievement could further be improved if students are academically motivated.               DISCUSSIONS                 The study explored the predictive power of student’s achievement motivation, locus of control and study habits towards their             mathematics achievement. The findings of the study show several points of discussion.                Achievement motivation is an inner drive that motivates the students to achieve a particular goal. With average achievement             motivation, a little guidance from the teacher is expected to achieve and perform better in mathematics. For most students, they             believed that their present course will help them to be successful in the future. In addition, to do better is working harder, setting             aside  activities  other  than  studying  harder.  These  are  proof  of  the  positive  relation  between  achievement  motivation  and             academic achievement. This further implies that if a student is motivated in reaching goals in life, he/she can achieve more success             as he/she will do everything to reach this goal.                Locus of control is a personal belief about who can control the consequences of a student’s action, referring to success and             failure in academics. Students having internal locus of control are expected to perform better in their academics given adequate             feedbacks. However, given that internal locus dominates their characteristics as college students, they enrolled in college because             they were expected to do so. Although they would like to finish college, it was not a mere priority for them but some other matters             in their lives. This further explains the result of this study that having internal locus of control has nothing to do with the student’s             mathematics achievement. Success in mathematics can never be attributed to chance nor luck, neither ability nor effort, but is             something is beyond having internal or external locus.                For  students’  study  habits,  the  obtained  desirable  study  habits  were  measured  in  terms  of  the  eight  domains  of  time             management, physical status, study aids/note taking, testing strategies, learning motivation, reading ability memory and health.             However, in terms of each domain, only the reading ability, memory and health gained undesirable study habits. This indicates             that students did not manifest fondness in reading or may have difficulties in understanding the meaning of some words. Students             also found it hard to remember the reviewed materials and experienced disappointments in the outcome of the examination. This             may be indicative of some intervention activities that the teacher may use to improve study habits in terms of reading ability,             memory and health as this have been to be influential in improved mathematics performance.               CONCLUSIONS                 Majority of the first year students have average achievement motivation, internal locus of control and desirable study habits.             This indicates that these students have moderate motivation to achieve success and that they perceive their success or failure             through their own efforts and abilities in studying mathematics. When a student passes or fails in the subject, he or she takes full             responsibility of the outcomes of his or her examination. A desirable study habits means that the student knows the importance             of  study  habits  in  his  or  her  mathematics  achievement.  In  terms  of  mathematics  achievement,  most  students  are  average             achievers while only few students are found to be high and low achievers.                Significant relationship existed between achievement motivation and mathematics achievement. Moreover, achievement             motivation was found to be the sole predictor of mathematics achievement. It can be stated that achievement motivation is             effective in enhancing mathematics achievement. The students’ motivation to achieve success will increase to high level if given             the right remediation so as to attain high mathematics achievement. Thus, it can be concluded that a high achievement motivation             can predict high mathematics achievement.

Before my mathematics examination, I read my own notes carefully.       2       1       0             26. I prepare for the examination in mathematics from the guides/notes available in the market.   2   1   0             27. I draw an outline of answers for each question before writing the answers to the questions in   2   1   0             the examination.             28. I feel tense at the beginning of the examination.                       2       1       0             29. After the examination, I realized that I have made some mistakes in the answers I have   2   1   0             written or I have forgotten some important points.             30. I carefully record my examination result in mathematics.                2       1       0             31. I single out the difficult topic on the strength of my examination results.   2   1     0             32. I try to make up for my deficiencies in mathematics.                    2       1       0             33. I get disappointed if the examination result in mathematics is not favourable.   2   1   0             34. I have a tendency to compare my marks in mathematics with others after the results are   2   1   0             declared.             35. I think that I can improve fairly my study habits in mathematics.       2       1       0             36. I get guidance about proper study habit from my mathematics teachers.   2       1       0             37.

The study helped create maps of the               number of cases of dengue in the 16 municipalities and 7 cities of Cavite from 2003 to 2020; determined the predictors of               dengue cases in terms of age and sex of the patients; and predicted the dengue cases in the year 2022, 2024, and 2026. The               dengue cases and patients' profiles from 2003 to 2020 in Cavite were obtained from the Provincial Epidemiology Surveillance               Unit (PESU). The maps of dengue cases from 2003 to 2020 and the predicted cases of dengue in the year 2022, 2024, and 2026               were created using ArcMap 10.4. Time series analysis was used to predict the dengue cases in Cavite in the years 2022, 2024,               and 2026. Based on the results, the highest dengue case was recorded in Dasmarinas City, followed by Bacoor City, Imus City,               Gen. Trias City, and TreceMartires City. In 2022, the forecasted dengue cases in Dasmarinas City are 1,995; 1,352 in Imus               City; and 1,260 in Bacoor City. In 2024, the forecasted dengue cases in Dasmarinas City are 2,228; 1,514 in Imus CIty; and               1,398 in Bacoor City. In 2026, the forecasted dengue cases in Dasmarinas City are 2,460; 1,676 in Imus City, and 1,537 in               Bacoor City. Dasmarinas City, Imus City, and Bacoor City in the province of Cavite are at risk of dengue in the years 2022,               2024, and 2026.                Keywords: Outbreak, epidemiology, public health, environmental health               ___________________________________________________________________________                1. Introduction                  Cavite  declared  a  province-wide  dengue  outbreak  from  the  year  2015  to  2018.  There  were  12,007  dengue               cases, of which 48 cases of deaths were reported in 2015; 5,121 cases with 25 deaths in 2016, and 6,129 cases               with  27  deaths in  the  upland and  lowland  part  of  the  province  in  2017. These recorded  cases  of  fatalities and               outbreaks  post  an  alarm  to  the  whole  province  (Giron.A.2018).  Provincial  Epidemiology  Surveillance  Unit               (PESU) announced that Cavite province has increased dengue cases up to 79 percent from January to June 2017               up to January to June 2018 (Pino.G.2018). Outbreaks were recorded at General Trias City, Bacoor City, Imus               City,  Dasmarinas  City,  and  TreceMartires  City  (Provincial  Epidemiology  Surveillance  Unit.2018).  The               breakdown of these dengue cases are as follows: Bacoor City  with 305 cases, Gen. Trias City  with 303 cases,               Imus City with 278 cases, Naic with 225 cases, Dasmariñas City with 192 cases, Tanza with 176 cases, Rosario               with 140 cases, Silang with 137 cases, TreceMartires City with 130 cases and Noveleta with 109 cases (UNTV               News and Rescue.2018). The numbers were confirmed by Dr. Nelson Soriano, the provincial epidemiologist.                  Furthermore, there were five cases of death and 1,499 dengue cases from January 1 to March 11, 2018; the five               cases  of  fatality  aged  between  4  to  23  years  old  (Cinco.M.2018).  Dengue  cases  in  the  Philippines  have  been               confirmed nationally and occur year-round in the country, with its peak transmission during the rainy season, May               to  November  (International  Association  for  Medical  Assistance  to  Travellers.2018).  The  World  Health               Organization (WHO) reported that 20,108 dengue cases had been registered nationwide from January to March               2018,  which  is  26  percent  lower  compared  to  the  same  period  where  27,023  cases  have  been  reported               (WHO.2018).  In  the  Philippines,  which  ranks  fourth  in  the  most  dengue  cases  in  Southeast  Asia,  dengue  is               considered one of the eight pervasive infectious diseases. Dengue can affect the country's economy because of the               loss  of  production  caused  by  illness  and  premature  deaths.  The  increase  in  healthcare  costs  contributes  to  an               additional burden to humans (Edilllo.F. et al.,2015).               2.Significance Of The Study                   The prediction and spatial distribution of the epidemiology of dengue in Cavite provides a holistic view of how               dengue can spread in the province. This study also provides a warning to the whole province to prevent possible               outbreaks of dengue. This can alarm the government officials and make people more aware of what will happen if               there  is an  outbreak.  Furthermore,  the results  of  this  study  can  be  a  basis  for  the  countermeasures  on how  to               prevent such a disaster. The data from this study can also serve as a baseline for future researchers.               3.Review Of Related Studies                  A high incidence of dengue has been recorded around the world. 2.5 billion people of the world’s population               are now at risk of dengue (Palaniyandi.M. et al.,2018). Dengue has become a major international public health                                                                                                              364","Turkish Journal of Computer and Mathematics Education              Vol.13 No.01 (2022), 364-371                                                                                            Research Article                 concern these past few years, and dengue hemorrhagic fever affects Asian countries. This causes hospitalization               and  death,  where  most  victims  are  children  (Bhandari.K.  at  al.,2008).  According  to  the  World  Health               Organization, there  may  be  50  million  cases  of  dengue  infection  worldwide  every  year.  The  global  burden  of               dengue is difficult and represents a growing challenge to public health officials (Bhatt.S. et al.,2013). The virus is               transmitted to humans through the bites of an infected female Aedes mosquito, which mainly acquires the virus               while feeding on an infected host. The symptoms of dengue fever include severe joint and muscle pain, swollen               lymph nodes, headache, fever, exhaustion, and rash. Dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) is a specific syndrome that               significantly  affects  children  under  10.  The  complication  of  dengue  causes  abdominal  pain,  hemorrhage,               circulatory collapse, and death if not immediately cured (Cunha.J. \& Stoppler.M.2018).                   Except for the extreme cold, mosquitoes can live in any environment, favoring forests, marshes, tall grasses               and  weeds,  and  ground  that  is  wet  at  least  part  of  the  year  (Mosquito  World.2018).  Environmental  factors               significantly  affect  the  breeding  and  development  of  Aedes  mosquitoes  because  they  are  sensitive  to               environmental  conditions.  Temperature,  precipitation,  and  humidity  are  critical  to  a  mosquito's  survival,               reproduction,  and  development  and  influence  its  presence  and  abundance.  Climate  and  environmental  factors               significantly  affect  the  abundance  of  mosquitoes  in  an  area,  especially  in  the  countries  where  transmissions               routinely occur with short-term changes in weather, temperature, precipitation (Center for Disease Control and               Prevention.2012).  Mapping  the  distribution  of  dengue  outbreaks  in  an  area  is  possible  with  Geographical               Information  System  (GIS),  which  can  provide  visual  identification  and  faster  mobilization  of  resources               (Duncombe.J. et al.,2012). GIS and spatial analysis are powerful tools that help describe epidemiological patterns               and detect, explain, and predict diseases in space and time (Adriana.T. et al.,2016). A graphical analysis of the               area  can  be  provided  because  GIS  can  capture  spatial  distribution  and  the  severity  of  the  distribution  of  the               disease.  It  can  identify  the  trends  and  patterns  to  indicate  the  affected  area  (Ai-leen.G.  \&  Song.R.2000).               Geographic Information System is recognized as an analytic tool for public health because it can identify the areas               where  outbreaks  originate  and  effectively  target  high-risk  of  different  diseases  for  early  prevention  (Er.A.  et               al.,2010).                4.Objectives Of The Study                     Determine the number of cases of dengue in the 16 municipalities and 7 cities of Cavite from 2003 to                      2020                     Identify the predictors in the prevalence of dengue in terms of age and sex                     Predict and map the areas at risk of dengue in the years 2022, 2024, and 2026                5.Hypotheses Of The Study                     Age and sex are not predictors of dengue prevalence in Cavite, Philippines               6.Study Area                   The study area is the whole province of Cavite. It is located on the southern shores of Manila Bay in Luzon               Island.               6.1.Statistical Techniques Used in the Present Study                  Dengue Predictors. Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to determine whether the patients'               demographic profile (age and sex) can be predictors of dengue prevalence in Cavite. PASW Statistic 18 was used               to perform the modeling. The dengue cases from 2003 to 2020 and demographic profile of dengue patients in               Cavite were obtained from the Provincial Epidemiology and Surveillance Unit (PESU). The maps of dengue cases               per year were generated using ArcMap 10.4.                  Time Series Analysis. The researchers employed forecasting to predict the number of cases in the succeeding               years, which required dependent (dengue cases from 2003 to 2020). The forecasted data was presented through               Expert  and  ARIMA  modelers  in  PASW  Statistic  18  software.  The  maps  of  predicted  dengue  cases  will  be               generated using ArcMap 10.4.                                                                                                                            365","Turkish Journal of Computer and Mathematics Education              Vol.13 No.01 (2022), 364-371                                                                                            Research Article                 6.2.Data Analysis and Interpretation                                                                                                                         Figure 3.

A low number of dengue cases were recorded in the other cities and municipalities from 2003 to               2009. From 2010 to 2011, dengue cases in Dasmariñas City ballooned to 800 cases. Furthermore, the epidemic               increased  to more than  1,300  dengue  cases  in the  City  of  Bacoor  in  2012 and more than 1000  cases  in  2013.               However, the number of cases suddenly fluctuated in 2014 with more than 400 cases recorded each in the cities of               Imus, Bacoor, and Dasmariñas.                  The increasing number of dengue cases from 2003 to 2020 is seen in the changes of colors on the maps (Figure               1). The dengue cases from 2003 to 2020 have a gradual increase. From 2003, it increased 3.8 times until 2007, and               it continued to increase until 2012 with 34 times the number of dengue cases from 2003. Moreover, the gradual               increase of dengue cases continued until 2018, and it rose again in 2019 in 12 cities and municipalities in Cavite,               having 400 cases above. Furthermore, there is a notable decrease in dengue cases in Cavite in 2020, whereas the               people have limited movement due to Covid-19 community quarantine restrictions.                  Dengue is considered one of the eight pervasive infectious diseases, and the Philippines ranked fourth in the               highest number of cases in Southeast Asia. Moreover, Cavite declared a province-wide dengue outbreak because               of the increasing number of dengue cases from the year 2015 to 2018 (Giron, A. 2018).               Table 1.

Most of the dengue patients in Cavite were male. In the case of India, most of the dengue patients were               male, and it has been attributed to their frequent outdoor activities compared to females. Thus, males have higher               chances of getting bitten by mosquitoes (Antony and Celine, 2014)                   Table 2.

Based on the outcome of the study, some of               the cities and municipalities of the province have an increasing trend of dengue cases from 2022 to 2026. For               2022, 2024, and 2026, there are 15 cities and municipalities predicted to have 0-400 cases from 2020 to 2026. It               has also been predicted that Silang, Trece Martires City, Bacoor City, Imus City, Gen. Trias City, and Dasmariñas               City  will  have  800  and  above  dengue  cases  from  2020  to  2026.  Moreover,  Dasmariñas  City  was  on  the  top,               predicted to have more than 2,001 cases of dengue in the years 2024 and 2026.                                                                                                              367","Turkish Journal of Computer and Mathematics Education              Vol.13 No.01 (2022), 364-371                                                                                            Research Article                    The continuous development of the province causes these results. The National Competitive Council of the               Philippines ranked Cavite as second in economic competencies among all provinces (Pronove,M.2017). Cavite is               one of the fastest-growing provinces in the Philippines. It is due to several reasons such as the availability of jobs,               proximity to Manila, getaway destination like Tagaytay, Batangas, and other places not as easily accessible if you               are not coming from Manila (Remo,A. 2017).               Maps of Dengue Prevalence in Cavite                  ArcMap 10.4 was used to generate maps of dengue prevalence in the province of Cavite for the succeeding               years. There were three points of prediction that were set: 2022, 2024, and 2026. Most of the entry points of the               disease in the province were located in lowland areas of Cavite (Figures 2-4).                                       Figure 2.

Recommendations                  The  predicted  number  of  cases  and  at-risk  areas  identified  in  this  study  could  serve  as  a  basis  for  further                  research  and  decision-making  processes  by  the  local  government  and  other  concerned  institutions.  We                  recommend to:                                                                                                               369","Turkish Journal of Computer and Mathematics Education              Vol.13 No.01 (2022), 364-371                                                                                            Research Article                       Evaluate the surveillance system of the province of Cavite.                     Examine  other  possible  predictors  such  as  climatic  factors,  population  density,  and  topographic               characteristics.                      Create  a  more  comprehensive  baseline  database  that  will  serve  as  a  basis  for  formulating  policy               interventions and health measures to prevent the transmission of the disease.                     Conduct the same study on other mosquito-vectored diseases such as Malaria and Chikungunya.               8. Conclusion                  Analysis of the secondary data obtained from the Provincial Epidemiology Surveillance Unit (PESU) of Cavite               showed an increasing number of dengue cases since 2010, with the city of Dasmariñas having the highest number               of cases that prompted the local government to declare a province-wide dengue outbreak from 2015 to 2018 to               address  the  epidemic.  However,  the  data  showed  that  there  had  been  a  decrease  in  recorded  cases  during  the               pandemic, which could impact the quarantine protocols set up by the government. Results of regression analysis               showed that sex was the only predictor of dengue cases in Cavite, as confirmed by the higher number of male               dengue patients since 2003. Based on these data, the forecast showed a continuous increase of cases in the coming               years and high prevalence in specific areas affected mainly by development such as Silang, TreceMartires City,               Bacoor City, Imus City, General Trias City, and Dasmariñas City.

Various                             alternative learning activities were considered by the tertiary education including                             the synchronous and asynchronous mode of online learning. The result of this                             study determined the perception of learners about alternative learning activities                             used in the virtual learning environment. Moreover, the performance of students                             in face to face and asynchronous learning activities were compared and tested for                             significant difference. It was found out that students who were taught with face                              to  face  learning  modality  has  significantly  higher  academic  performance  than                             those students who were taught with alternative learning modality but alternative                             learning  mode  could  still  be  used  to  further  the  learning  during  this  time  of                             pandemic.

These have resulted in  widespread                disruption including closure of schools (Viner et al., 2020).  As the world transitions to a new normal, there                have been calls for substantial improvements in processes to facilitate safe, effective and ethical care in the post-                COVID era (Mitchell \& Nou, 2020).  Enhanced community quarantine has been enforced in the Philippines in                 response to the growing spread of the novel coronavirus outbreak (Ravelo, 2020). Responses like community                lockdown and community quarantine of several countries have led students and teachers to study and work from                home which led to the delivery of online learning platforms (Angelova, 2020 ; Crawford et al., 2020; Ghazi-                Saidi et al., 2020; Hebebci, Bertiz, \& Alan, 2020; Niemi, \& Kousa, 2020; Sahin \& Shelley, 2020).  Commission                on Higher Education (CHED) Chairman Prospero de Vera III said that flexible learning shall be implemented                this year. He added that universities and colleges have the freedom to choose what mode would be effective for                them (Magsambol, 2020). The mode of learning can be synchronous, asynchronous, or both.                  Several  studies  have  been  conducted  to  determine  the  difference  in  the  use  of  face  to  face  learning  and                distance/online learning.  Bali and Liu (2018) found that face-to-face learning perception was higher than online                                                                140","International Journal of Studies in Education and Science (IJSES)                  learning  in  terms  of  social  presence,  social  interaction,  and  satisfaction.  However,  there  is  no  statistically                significant difference in learning preference found among level of student. The study also showed that some                students were very comfortable in online learning since it led them to the chance of being innovative by using                 computer technology.  In another study by  Arias, Swinton, \&  Anderson (2018), students in the face to face                section have statistically significant higher exam scores and statistically significantly greater improvement on                the post-test instructor questions. There is no statistical difference in the improvement on the post-test overall                nor in the improvement in the post-test standardized questions.                 These mixed results suggest that both course objectives and mechanisms used to assess the relative effectiveness                of the two modes of education may play an important part in determining the relative effectiveness of alternative                 delivery methods. Hence, this study determined the perception of learners about alternative learning activities                used in virtual learning environment as well as if it facilitate or hinder the learning process. The result of the                study  provided  a  glimpse  of  perspective  if  alternative  learning  activities  can  be  used  as  a  paradigm  shift  in                teaching and learning process in the new normal.                 Moreover, the students‟ academic performance during face to face and asynchronous learning activities was also                 compared to support the affectivity of the learning experiences. Furthermore, this study can help educational                leaders and curriculum managers decide in considering which learning modality better facilitate learning in the                new normal. On the other hand, students may also gain broader understanding of alternative learning activities                as a paradigm shift in the teaching and learning process. Likewise, future researchers may gain benefit in this                study. The results of the study suggest new information which is useful as a basis for future studies.                  Literature Review                 The  works  of  the  professional  researchers  helped  the  present  researchers  gain  idea  regarding  the  students‟                perception in online and face to face learning activities. It also helped determine the difference between the                 academic performances of students in face to face learning activities from asynchronous learning activities. In                addition, the previous studies provided information regarding the pandemic and its effect in the education sector                including information about synchronous and asynchronous learning arrangement.                 Rise of COVID-19                 The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic as the confirmed cases rise around the                 world (Ducharme, 2020). This started in China and is caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2, previously                known as 2019-nCoV) and has received global attention from growing infections and on how to eradicate the                disease and flatten the curve of infections (Guo et al., 2020). Symptoms include fever, fatigue, cough, lack of                appetite, body aches, shortness of breath, and phlegm which can be transferred when the infected person coughs                or sneezes. They can spray droplets as far as 6 feet away. If you breathe them in or swallow them, the virus can                get into your body (Pathak, 2020). Though it affects people of all ages, it is most vulnerable to adults, children                 and people with underlying medical conditions (WHO, 2020).                                                               141","Silvero, Sebastian, \& Mojica                  The  coronavirus  COVID-19  outbreak  disrupted  life  around  the  globe  in  2020  and  has  profound  effects  and                impacts on almost all sectors in the  human race (Gonzalez et al., 2020). These have resulted in  widespread                disruption  such  as  travel  restrictions  (Chinazzi  et  al.,  2020),  closure  of  schools  (Viner  et  al.,  2020),  global                 economic recession (Fernandes, 2020), political conflicts (Barrios \& Hochberg, 2020), racism (Habibi et al.,                2020), and misinformation and controversies (Enitan et al., 2020), to name a few.                 As the world transitions to a new normal, there have been calls for substantial improvements in processes to                facilitate safe, effective and ethical care in the post-COVID era (Mitchell \& Nou, 2020).  Enhanced community                quarantine  has  been  enforced  in  the  Philippines  in  response  to  the  growing  spread  of  the  novel  coronavirus                outbreak (Ravelo, 2020). The education sector is highly affected (Tria, 2020). Most countries around the world                 have temporarily closed educational institutions to contain the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic and reduce                infections. This closure has affected more than 1.2 billion learners worldwide with more than 28 million learners                in the Philippines (UNESCO, 2020). Responses like community lockdown and community quarantine of several                countries  have  led  students  and  teachers  to  study  and  work  from  home  which  led  to  the  delivery  of  online                learning platforms (Crawford et al., 2020).                  Education in the New Normal                 To  respond  to  the  needs  of  learners,  especially  of  the  3.5  million  tertiary-level  students  enrolled  in                approximately  2,400  Higher  Education  Institutions  (HEIs),  certain  HEIs  in  the  country  have  implemented                proactive policies for the continuance of education despite the closure. These policies include modified forms of                online learning that aim to facilitate student learning activities (Joaquin et al., 2020). Online learning might be in                terms of synchronous, real-time lectures and time-based outcomes assessments, or asynchronous, delayed-time                 activities, like pre-recorded video lectures and time-independent assessments (Oztok et al., 2013).                 Commission on Higher Education (CHED) Chairman Prospero de Vera III said that flexible learning will be                implemented this year. He added that universities and colleges have the freedom to choose what mode would be                effective for them. Some of them would be using pure online, pure modular, while others are combination of the                two (Magsambol, 2020).                  In flexible learning, students gain access and flexibility with regard to at least one of the following dimensions:                time, place, pace, learning style, content assessment or learning path (Muller et al., 2019).  It focuses on the                design  and  delivery  of  programs,  courses,  and  learning  interventions  that  address  learners‟  unique  needs  in                terms of the given dimensions. It does not necessarily require connectivity (Cervantes, 2020). Further, it aims to                decongest the classroom to reduce the number of students who go there at one time so that distancing and the                health of the students can be protected (San Juan, 2020).                  Asynchronous and Synchronous Learning                 Asynchronous  learning  means  that  there  is  no  set  time  for  the  learning  to  be  occurring.  Learners  can  learn                                                                142","International Journal of Studies in Education and Science (IJSES)                  anywhere and can consume their time to gain knowledge of what they want to  know and when they need to                know. On the other hand, synchronous learning is related to structure and time-bounded activities, which are                offered  through  web  conferencing  and  chatting  options  (Malik  et  al.,  2017).  Further,  asynchronous  learning                 makes it possible for learners to log on to an e-learning environment at any time and download documents or                send  messages  to  teachers  or  peers.  Students  may  spend  more  time  refining  their  contributions,  which  are                generally considered more thoughtful compared to synchronous communication (Hrastinski, 2008).                 Asynchronous Learning and Face to Face Learning                 The biggest opportunity that face to face learning presents is the ability to discuss, collaborate, practice, and role                 play, all live and with guidance from a facilitator on hand. Being part of a group and being held accountable are                powerful  learning  tools.  Meanwhile,  asynchronous  learning  is  self-paced,  accommodates  a  busy  schedule,                allows people to learn at their own pace, provides consistent instruction to very large audience groups and is                available for review (Malamed, 2011). Furthermore, the  biggest differences between  online and face to face                learning  have  always  been  in  the  realm  of  fostering  connection  and  collaboration  between  learners.  The                importance of face to face interaction in education is vital. Social interaction has a richness that might feel hard                 to replicate in the digital world. However, it is not impossible in the corporate world (Cooke, 2020).                 Students’ Performance in Face to Face Learning and Online Learning                 According to a study by Bali and Liu (2018), face to face learning perception was higher than online learning in                terms  of  social  presence,  social  interaction,  and  satisfaction.  However,  there  is  no  statistically  significant                difference in learning preference found among level of student. The study also showed that some students were                 very  comfortable  in  online  learning  since  it  led  them  to  the  chance  of  being  innovative  by  using  computer                technology.                 With  regards  to  students‟  performance,  students  in  online  courses  do  as  well  in  objective  measure  of                performance,  but  not  better  than  students  in  face  to  face  courses.  According  to  Allen  and  Seaman  (2006),                students need more discipline to succeed in online courses. Lack of self-discipline would have a more severe                 impact on student performance in, especially asynchronous, online courses where students are often attracted by                appeal of anytime, anywhere structure of the course which is somewhat inconsistent with the previous finding                that online students and traditional students performed equally well (Daymont \& Blau, 2008).                 In another study by Arias, Swinton, \& Anderson (2018), students in the face to face section have statistically                significant  higher  exam  scores  and  statistically  significantly  greater  improvement  on  the  post-test  instructor                questions. There is no statistical difference in the improvement on the post-test overall nor in the improvement                 in the post-test standardized questions. These mixed results suggest that both course objectives and mechanisms                used  to  assess  the  relative  effectiveness  of  the  two  modes  of  education  may  play  an  important  part  in                determining the relative effectiveness of alternative delivery methods.                                                                 143","Silvero, Sebastian, \& Mojica                  Blended Learning                 According to  Alammary, Sheard, and Carbone (2014), the term blended learning has no single agreed  upon                 definition. Although this might appear to be an academic point, the consequence is that it allows teachers and                course  designers  to  develop  their  own  understandings  of  the  term  within  the  context  of  their  courses  or                institutions,  and  then  use  that  as  a  basis  to  design  their  blended  courses.  In  2002,  Driscoll  identified  four                different concepts denoted by blended learning: (1) To combine or mix modes of web-based technology (e.g.,                live  virtual  classroom,  self-paced  instruction,  collaborative  learning,  streaming  video,  audio,  and  text)  to                accomplish  an  educational  goal;  (2)  To  combine  various  pedagogical  approaches  (e.g.,  constructivism,                behaviorism, cognitivism) to produce an optimal learning outcome with or without instructional technology. (3)                 To combine any form of instructional technology (e.g., videotape, CD-ROM,  web-based training,  film)  with                face to face instructor-led learning.                 Drawing  on  the  Driscoll  (2002)  work,  Oliver  and  Trigwell  (2005)  proposed  three  different  definitions  of                blended  learning:  (1)  The  combination  of  media  and  tools  employed  in  an  e-learning  environment;  (2)  The                combination of a number of pedagogic approaches, irrespective of the learning technology used; and (3) The                 integrated combination of traditional learning with web-based online approaches.                 Theoretical Framework                 As  seen  in  Figure  1,  the  model  shows  which  pedagogical  objectives  and  activities  drive  the  approaches,                including the online technology that faculty members use in instruction. The model also suggests that blending                the objectives, activities, and approaches within multiple modalities might be most effective for, and appeal to, a                 wide range of students. The most important feature of this model is that pedagogy drives the approaches that                will work best to support student learning.

This included the utilization of the                online learning system which can be conducted synchronously or asynchronously. On the other hand, blended                learning as defined by Oliver and Trigwell (2005) is the combination of a number of pedagogic approaches,                 irrespective of the learning technology used. Moreover, blended learning can be utilized in the said alternative                learning system as long as it combines various pedagogical approaches to produce an optimal learning outcome                with or without instructional technology.                 Research Questions                 Generally, this study aimed to determine if alternative learning activities can be used as a paradigm shift in the                 teaching and learning process in the new normal.  Specifically, it sought to answer the following:                    1.  What  perceptions  do  learners  have  about  alternative  learning  activities  used  in  virtual  learning                        environment?                    2.  Do alternative learning activities facilitate learning or hinder the process?                    3.  Can alternative learning activities be used as a paradigm shift in the teaching and learning process in                        the new normal?                  Method                Research Design                  This study is a descriptive-correlation research investigating alternative learning activities – synchronous and                asynchronous mode of learning as a paradigm shift in the teaching and learning process in the new normal. The                significant  difference  in  the  students‟  academic  performance  during  face  to  face  and  asynchronous  learning                activities was also determined.                 Sampling and Participants                  The  participants  of  the  study  were  teacher  education  students  in  a  state  university  who  took  Child  and                Adolescent Learners and Learning Principles course under the same instructor. The first group of students took                the course under the online modality which utilizes the asynchronous learning mode during the conduct of the                study; while the second group took the course under the face to face learning modality.  Students were selected                purposively.                  Instruments                 The instruments used by the researcher are the data gathered from the students‟ Senior High School Form 138                from  the  university  registrar,  the  students‟  final  grade  in  the  course,  Child  and  Adolescent  Learners  and                Learning  Principles  from  their  instructor,  and  the  responses  of  the  teacher  education  students  in  the  survey                questionnaire which determined their perception towards the use alternative learning activities in virtual learning                 environment.                                                               145","Silvero, Sebastian, \& Mojica                  Data Gathering and Procedure                 Students‟ grades during their Senior High School were obtained from their Form 138 submitted to the Office of                 the University Registrar.  Permission was sought first prior to actual data gathering.  This was to establish a                point of comparison among the two groups of students.  Then, the participants were asked to respond in a survey                questionnaire  to  determine  their  perception  towards  alternative  learning  activities  used  in  virtual  learning                environment.                 The  questionnaire  consists  of  three  parts.  The  first  part  is  the  personal  information  which  determined  the                student‟s  email  address,  age,  sex,  civil  status,  and  how  they  support  their  studies.  The  second  part  of  the                 questionnaire is composed of five questions regarding their familiarity and experiences on synchronous teaching                and learning process. This includes multiple-choice type questions, check boxes, and supply-type questions.                 The third part of the questionnaire is composed of six questions regarding their familiarity and experiences on                asynchronous  teaching  and  learning  process.  A  final  question  on  which  mode  better  facilitates  teaching  and                learning  is  also  included.  Their  final  grades  in  the  course  were  obtained  from  the  teacher  who  handled  the                 course.                 Data Analysis                 Two groups of college students were the focus of this study.  The first group, controlled group, was graduates of                senior high school and were taught using face-to-face interaction in the normal classroom setup and enrolled in a                certain state university under the teacher education program during the First Semester, AY 2019 – 2020. The                 second group  was graduates  of SHS  in the  new  normal and enrolled in the  same  university  under the same                program during the First Semester of the following year.                 Demographic  profiles  were  collected  among  these  participants.  Also,  their  perceptions  towards  alternative                learning activities were sought. These were done through an online survey via Google forms that were sent to                the participants. These two  groups  were also compared in terms of their academic performance. In order to                 establish some point of comparison for the said two groups, it was necessary to determine if there exists no                significant difference in their academic performance prior to admission to college. In this regard, independent                samples t-test was used to accomplish the task.                 Once no significant difference has been established in the two groups, their final grades were compared and                tested for significant differences to determine whether the use of alternative learning activities will have the                same effect to student‟s academic performance when they were taught using face-to-face classroom setup.  Also,                 Cohen‟s  d  was  used  to  describe  the  effect  size  on  the  teaching  methodology  used.

This  includes  a  letter  of  request  addressed  to  the                campus administrator, department chair, and registrar. To protect their basic rights, privacy, and confidentiality,                all direct identifiers were removed. All participants were given fictive names as well as the instructor of the                 course. This is an important step that none of the participants will be recognizable. All the gathered data were                treated with utmost confidentiality and was used solely for the completion of the study.

In addition,                students viewed that some lessons cannot be learned through readings and self-study which is why the presence                of  the  instructor  and  social  interaction  is  vital  in  learning.  On  the  other  hand,  30.30%  of  the  participants                reiterated  the  conduct  of  asynchronous  teaching  and  learning  because  it  promotes  independent  learning.

Four options were given in this regard:                20, 30, 40 and 50 minutes. They were also given the option to give other comments.  Majority reiterated that                synchronous sessions should be up to 50 minutes only.  This was due to some internet connectivity and screen                time issues.                                          Table 5.

Various  alternative  learning  activities  were                considered by the tertiary education including the synchronous and asynchronous mode of online learning. This                study showed that most students are familiar with the conduct of the said alternative learning activities. They                reiterated that teaching and learning could be better taught/learned synchronously in a desirable duration of 50                minutes  only.  When  it  comes  to  asynchronous  mode  of  learning,  the  use  of  video  discussions  and                modules/lectures/handouts appealed most helpful to the learners. Majority of the students actively participate s                 in synchronous session as it allows for a more dynamic exploration of topics, ideas, and concepts. Moreover,                asynchronous learning activities develop them to be more independent and responsible for their own learning.                Overall, students preferred the combination of synchronous and asynchronous mode of learning in effectively                facilitating  the  teaching  and  learning  process.  Further,  students  who  were  taught  with  face  to  face  learning                modality has a significantly higher academic performance than those students who were taught with alternative                 learning modality. Hence, teaching and learning activities could still be better in face-to-face learning modality                but alternative learning mode could still be used to further the learning during this time of pandemic.                 The study found out that the strongest point of asynchronous learning modality is that it allows for independent                learning. On the other hand, its weakest point is the absence of active presence in the discussion and that the                combination  of  synchronous  and  asynchronous  learning  activities  better  facilitate  the  teaching  and  learning                process. Therefore, the authors recommend establishing constant feedback and communication with the students                 during the conduct of alternative learning activities.

These trends are significant to meet                the future needs and challenges in education through the pervasive application of Information and                Communication Technology (ICT).  In addition, the emergence of COVID-19 pandemic and the                imminent presence of different COVID-19 variants (Delta) brought unforeseen disruptions in                the lives of people all over the world.  The Philippine higher education institutions (HEIs) are                no exemption in facing such critical situations.  To ensure the continuity of learning among                tertiary students while avoiding and/or limiting the risks of infection in the community, HEIs                explored and shifted to other innovative learning modalities that transmigrate the conduct of                classes  from  traditional  to  flexible  learning  modalities,  which  gave  students  the  option  to                choose the most convenient delivery modes to them.  This flexible learning modality emerged                during the First Semester of Academic Year 2020–2021 where it was used for the conduct of                lecture classes, leaving behind the conduct of laboratory classes that require a more rigid                training for students in face-to-face classes.                         As CvSU Tanza increases its enrolment during the First Semester of AY 2021 – 2022, from                1,154 students last year now caters a projected 1700 enrollees, thus compelling the campus to                hire additional faculty members. With this, there is an urgent need to conduct faculty orientation                and re-orientation and further explore other innovative flexible learning modalities that suit the                capacity, capability, and connectivity of our teachers and learners.                 Objectives                        The activity aims to provide our faculty members with additional information and enhance                different ways on  flexible  learning  modality of education delivery  with  the aid of  ICT and new                technologies.

He  also                    congratulated the faculty members who will be promoted with the NBC 461 8  Cycle and thanked                                                                                           th                    Ms. Sebastian for her time and effort in assisting the faculty members in preparing and submitting                    the necessary documents for NBC.                           The meeting then proceeded to the main agenda. He asked the chairs of each department                    to report. Mr. Banate, the department chair of the Department of Management reported that one                    of the recently hired faculty members of their department has backed out and they already posted                    a hiring notice. However, they only got one applicant. Prof. Ramos advised to welcome even fresh                    graduates to apply, especially those who graduated with honors.                           Ms. Senaris, the chair of the Department of Information Technology, then reported that                    they already successfully filled the necessary number of faculty members in the department. Ms.                    Sebastian, the chair of the Teacher Education Department also reported that they already have","complete number of faculty members. She then opened her concern about the deployment of their                    students as practice teachers for face-to-face teaching. She asked if they can hold a face-to-face                    demonstration teaching in the campus for them to assess their students’ readiness, knowledge,                    and skills in actual teaching, before their deployment. This will be held for 3 days, with 42 Education                    students and they plan to start the activity the following week. Prof. Ramos approved the request                    and advised that they may not deploy the students who will not pass their assessment.                           Ms. Fabian then reported about the recruitment of faculty members for the Department of                    Arts and Sciences being completed. She also said that the Job Order faculty members especially                    the newly hired should submit their requirements as soon as possible for their contracts.                           In  line  with  the  preparation  of  the  opening  of  classes,  Prof.  Ramos  asked  the  faculty                    members to follow the prescribed syllabus in their handled courses. He then asked Ms. Sebastian                    about  any  updates  regarding  the  NBC.  Ms.  Sebastian  told  the  group  that  those  who  will  be                    promoted to one to three steps are already certain of the reclassification while those who will be                    promoted to at least four steps will still wait for BOR approval.                           The meeting then proceeded to the next agenda which is the admission and enrolment.                    Ms. Perida, the campus registrar, reported that there are 556 qualified first year students who                    already confirmed their slots but only 369 of them submitted the necessary requirements. Prof.                    Ramos then asked Ms. Perida to extend the deadline of requirements until September 16, 2022,                    Friday. Ms. Perida then added that there are already 1200 old students enrolled. She also reported                    that there are four students who requested transfer credentials to transfer to CvSU-Cavite City                    campus but currently requesting to return to the campus because they were not able to secure                    their slots in Cavite City. However, because their transfer credentials were already signed and                    released, their request to return were not granted.                           Prof. Ramos then opened the next agenda which is the campus designation. He told the                    group that the campus needs reappointment of designations. First, he will be the department chair                    of the Department of Arts and Sciences but Mr. Mark Joel Sibulo will help him perform his duties                    as chair. Second, Ms. Sebastian will still be the research coordinator of the campus. He then told                    the group to include the performance of their designations as one of their priorities. He announced                    that Dr. Polinga already approved the designation of the staff to administrative positions.                           He also announced that the campus will no longer have an official campus vehicle because                    he already returned it to the main campus. Proceeding to the next agenda, he asked TED to get                    an update about English Critic accreditation to have additional accredited English Critic in the                    campus.                           For the next agenda, he announced that it was already allowed to use textbooks and he                    suggested  that  the  campus  sell  textbooks  as  an  income-generating  project.  Prof.  Ramos                    recommended his books to be sold but reminded that the students should not be required to buy                    the textbooks that the campus will sell.                           Prof.  Ramos  shared  to  the  group  that  the  main  campus  will  be  having  an  extension                    program in Brgy. Bagtas which is planting kaong. They plan to hold a transfer of technology to                    Bagtas  residents,  specifically  the  production  of  vinegar  and  sugar  from  kaong.  Prof.  Ramos                    suggested that the campus anchor its extension program to this activity of the main campus.                    However, Ms. Villa, the extension program coordinator of the campus told the group that there is                    already an approved campus extension program.                           Other matters discussed during the meeting includes the request of Prof. Ramos to have                    a copy of the raw data of the monthly attendance report of the faculty. He added that in line with                    the  new  HR  Memo  on  work  arrangement,  the  faculty  members  will  continue  to  follow  their                    alternative work arrangement schedule (two days WFH and two days campus reporting) while the                    non-academic staff will be reporting to the campus four days a week. He then announced that Ms.                    Fabian and Mr. Fred will be the liaison officers.                           After this, Prof. Ramos shared some reminders for the opening of classes. He reminded                    the group to be not too lenient to the students. With this, Ms. Sebastian shared that the TED will                    be starting to require student attendance to class meetings.

Before                    he officially discussed the main agenda of the meeting, he requested Mr. Crisostomo Sibulo to                    lead a prayer. After this, he go through the agenda of the meeting.                           He asked the group about the status of preparation for COPC. Ms. Sebastian reported that                    the preparation is already 80% completed but they are having problems with the facility of the                    campus. She proposed that the faculty room be used as laboratory and lecture rooms. The campus                    was able to borrow 30 computers from the students and proposed to have a memorandum of                    agreement with Bagtas Elementary School and Tanza National Trade School for borrowing of                    additional computers.                           Prof. Ramos opened the concern about the P5,000 being requested by the Department of                    Information Technology for the installation of tiles in the computer laboratory and shared to the                    group that he already asked Dr. Manuel about it and was told that the requested improvement is                    not required. He then asked about update on the requested purchase of equipment and facilities                    for accreditation. Ms. Sebastian reported that Dr. Polinga held over the purchase request because                    the campus has no available space. Prof. Ramos then told the group that because there is lack of                    support from the administration, the campus can document whatever is available in the campus                    and use the result of evaluation as the basis of what to improve in the campus. After this, Ms.                    Senaris shared the problem of the department about the lack of faculty member with master’s                    degree and reported that she included Ms. Lewis from Trece Martires City Campus to the list of                    faculty.                           Prof. Ramos then shared that the donated lot for Tanza Campus was already presented                    during the academic council meeting. He also shared to the group that he already requested to                    the OVPAA that the campus will continue to hold online classes because of the lack of campus                    facilities. Mr. Mark Sibulo then asked if there is already a target date of constructing the new","campus  building.  Prof.  Ramos  answered  that  there  is  still  no  concrete  schedule  about  the                    construction.                           Mr. Banate then reported about their department’s preparation for COPC. He shared that                    he is already finalizing the presentation and was able to borrow faculty from the main campus                    resulting to 84% faculty members having master’s degree. He then told Prof. Ramos that Mr.                    Mintu,  the  Brgy.  Bagtas  Chairperson,  is  asking  about  the  schedule  of  MOA  signing  with  the                    University for the lot donated to Tanza campus. Prof. Ramos said that it is still on process of                    approval.                           Prof. Ramos then shared that the mock presentation of TED for COPC was postponed but                    each department should continue their preparation. He also reminded the group to just present                    what is available in the campus. He then asked for understanding for not being able to go to the                    campus for health concerns and thanked the group for all their efforts.                           After this, Ms. Banag presented the proposed streamlined designations.                           Ms. Fabian then reminded the Contract of Service faculty members to submit authority to                    go two days before the schedule because it needs to be submitted to different offices.                           Prof. Ramos shared that the campus is not oblige to conduct a face-to-face class and to                    be able to implement limited face-to-face, the campus must submit the necessary documents for                    application  for  F2F  and  approval  from  the  LGU  is  also  necessary.  The  faculty  members  and                    students must also be fully vaccinated and the students should have their parent’s consent.                           Before the meeting ends, Ms. Addangna extended her gratitude to Ms. Sebastian, Mr.                    Delgado, Ms. Fabian, and Mr. Mark Sibulo for being approachable.

In addition, Ms.          77        Elamparo mentioned that BSHM/BSTM students who wished to conduct the OJT shall pay a          78        minimum amount of PhP4,000 to complete their virtual OJT.  Due to this, she made a poll with          79        the BSHM students if ever they would pursue the virtual OJT and pay the necessary amount.          80        Based on the results, most of the students signified their non-intention to pursue the virtual          81        OJT due to financial constraints.          82          83               Prof. Ramos announced that the CHED is now offering Scholarships for Instructors'          84        Knowledge Advancement Program (SIKAP) for faculty members who wish to pursue graduate          85        degree programs in CHED recognized schools.

The College of Education, Office of the Graduate School, Naic          97        Campus and Carmona Campus had already finished the virtual validation.  Prof. Sebastian          98        mentioned that the preparation of the said documents is on-going. There have been some          99        problems encountered as regards some supplies and materials relative to the preparation.         100        Prof. Ramos pledged that the funds shall be available in terms of the campus cash advance.         101        However, Ms. Noemi Perida mentioned that she encountered difficulties in canvassing some         102        supplies and materials because there was a tight budget.  Prof. Sebastian made mentioned         103        that  the  group  also  find  it  difficult  to  get  certified  copies  of  faculty  credentials  since  the         104        University Records Office does not certify copies of TOR and diploma who are not graduates         105        of the university.

Before          54        he officially discussed the main agenda of the meeting, he had some announcements for the          55        group based on the administrative council meeting that was held the other day.  He announced          56        that the campus water supply will be provided by the Office of the ABC President, Hon. SM","57        Matro.  He also announced that the PhP4.5-million allotment for the two-storey building of          58        CvSU Tanza Campus has been approved and that the group could expect its construction in          59        the near future.  He further announced that the PhP50-million allotment for the 3-5 storey          60        building of the campus has been approved.  The campus shall seek the assistance of the          61        Bagtas LGU for any donation of land to realize this vision, especially when the campus shall          62        be subjecting four of its programs under the CHED visit to obtain the Certificates of Program          63        Compliance.          64          65               Another  concern  that  was  being  raised  during  the  Administrative  Council  was  the          66        complaints through the 8888.  Most of Contract of Service (COS) Faculty members were filing          67        concerns regarding the delay of salaries.  He sympathized with those faculty members but he          68        mentioned that these faculty members must expedite all possible means to complete their          69        requirements in order not to delay their salaries.          70          71               He  announced  that  each  faculty  member  shall  give  major  examinations,  such  as          72        midterm and final exams in line with the school calendar.  However, faculty members shall          73        have the leeway on when to give their midterm examination, depending on the lessons that          74        were already discussed.          75          76               Prof. Ramos shared to the group that there was an alleged Diploma Factory in Tanza,          77        being posted in the Facebook. This was discussed during the Administrative Council Meeting.          78        He  requested  everyone  to  help  the  campus  in  tracking  down  the  source  or  production  of          79        falsified documents.          80          81               He announced that there will be also class observation after the midterm examination.          82        He requested everyone to submit their schedule of classes for the classroom observation.  This          83        shall be the basis for re-hiring of faculty members for the next semester.          84          85               He  announced  that  the  Office  of  the  University  President  request  each  campus  to          86        prepare  its  dashboard  of  information.

Submission of requirements (Grades, teaching portfolio, etc.)           29           30       Prof. Noel A. Sedigo, informed everyone to comply with the health protocols inside the campus           31   strictly. The security guards were oriented to check every employee's temperature coming in and           32   reminded them to use alcohol to sanitize their hands and of the visitors upon entering the campus           33   premises. Likewise the so-called social distancing should be strictly imposed. Further, he emphasized           34   that  each  campus  will  undergo  an  immediate  disinfection  with  the  help  of  the  campus  utility           35   personnel.           36           37       Each faculty member is advised by Prof. Sedigo to prepare the course syllabus as early as now. He           38   reminded all department chairs to give all faculty loads so that they can prepare course syllabi and           39   modules, which is due on July 30, 2020. Mr. Luke Ty presented a lecture on how to design course           40   syllabi and modules applicable in today's new normal environment. The approach is blended, online,           41   and modular.           42           43       Prof.  Sedigo  suggested  to  the  faculty  to  be  clear  about  the  references.  References  must  be           44   coordinated with the campus librarian for listing and acquisition of books. Ms. Villarante, the campus           45   librarian, agreed and added that references, particularly electronic references, will be incorporated           46   into the campus e-library.           47           48       Ms. Noemi Perida clarifies if possible to allow second-year students (HM and IT) to apply for           49   graduation or  proceed  for  a  BS  degree. Prof.  Sedigo  responded  with, \"yes  they  can.\"  He  further           50   reminded everyone that T3 Campuses would not be having midyear classes for 2020. Ms. Feranail           51   added that the students in the following semesters could take those subjects scheduled for midyear           52   class 2020.           53","54       Regarding workload, Mr. Ritch Banate and Prof. Arlene Estrada confirmed that they had already           55   given the subjects to be taught by each of the faculty members under their departments. Likewise,           56   all other department chairs also assured that they already distributed subjects to the respective           57   faculty members under their department.           58           59       Prof. Sedigo announced to submit requirements or faculty portfolios before the deadline to avoid           60   the  salary  delay.  He  likewise  asked  why  most  of  Trece  Campus  faculty  members  have  not  yet           61   submitted their grading sheets. Some answered that they still need to get their student files and           62   records from the campus to do so.           63           64       Also, Prof. Sedigo reminded the department chairs and HR coordinators to finalize the number of           65   faculty to be hired this First Semester AY 2020-2021 and in as much as possible consider those with           66   masters’ degree and as well as doctors’ degree. This is in consideration for bolstering the faculty           67   profile of the campuses and also for long term considerations.           68           69   No further matter was discussed.           70           71   The meeting adjourned at 2:30 p.m.           72           73   Prepared by:                                       Noted by:           74           75           76   JESSIE ANNE T.

Sedigo, the campus coordinator, consulted the body to decide whether to have           34   midyear classes or not. The body agreed not to hold midyear classes this 2020 for T3 Campuses. Prof.           35   Feranil said that summer subjects could be taken during the next semesters instead if there would           36   take no midyear classes for T3. According to Prof. Sedigo, the midyear period will be devoted to the           37   faculty to have training and seminars to prepare for the new normal classes this coming First Semester           38   AY 2020.           39           40   CRISIS MANAGEMENT OFFICER           41       Prof. Sedigo appointed Ms. Lontoc, T3 nurse to be the T3 Crisis Management Officer. This ensures           42   the safety for everyone reporting in the T3 campuses once Enhanced Community Quarantine is lifted           43   and for the strict compliance with the Department of Health's health protocols. Ms. Lontoc added           44   that she already ordered the necessary materials and equipment needed for the three campuses,           45   such  as  face  masks,  alcohol,  temperature  scanner,  etc.  Further,  Prof.  Sedigo  requested  that           46   disinfection for each campus shall be done prior to the reporting of the skeletal force.           47           48   WORKLOAD AND TEACHING ASSIGNMENT           49       Prof. Sedigo asked Prof. Feranil about the status of the Workload and Teaching. Prof. Feranil said           50   that she already distributed the loads to the respective department chairs; however, none of the           51   department chairs submitted the accomplished load assignments.           52","53       Prof. Sedigo calls the attention of Mr. Keno Villavicencio, IT Department Chair, to canvass for           54   Learning  Management  System  Seminars  in  preparation  for  a  blended  teaching  approach.  Mr.           55   Villavicencio  responded  that  he  already  had  contacts  for  MIS  and  need  to  finalize  the  proposal           56   content still.           57           58       Ms. Jelyn Digma suggested that face to face approach can be adopted only for students who do           59   not have internet access.           60           61       Ms. Arlene Estrada said that it is better if the University can develop one uniform module that           62   can be used systemwide.           63           64   REALIGNMENT OF BUDGET           65       Prof. Sedigo instructed the Budget Officers to realign the budget, such as the budget for seminars,           66   trainings, conferences, accreditation, to budget for equipment and other things necessary for the new           67   normal classes.           68           69   GRADES AND TEACHING PORTFOLIO           70       Prof. Sedigo reminded all to submit the grades and teaching portfolio on time to avoid delay on           71   salaries, especially for the faculty with a contract of service status. He instructed all department chairs           72   to check all the requirements of faculty upon submission.           73           74   HEALTH PROTOCOLS           75       Dr. Demetillo, T3 Secretary, presented some of the health protocols and preventive measures           76   against COVID 19 to the T3 campuses key officials. Prof. Sedigo advised Ms. Lontoc to facilitate the           77   purchase  request  of  alcohol,  masks,  temperature  scanners,  foot  disinfectant  mats,  etc.  for  T3           78   campuses.  He  likewise  instructed  the  campus  coordinators  to  help  monitor  in  ensuring  the           79   compliance of the mentioned health protocols. Ms. Lontoc responded and she said that she will do it           80   immediately.           81           82   OTHER MATTERS           83       Prof.  Sedigo  reminded  HR  coordinators  to  prepare  a  recommendation  letter  to  rehire  non-           84   teaching personal with a contract about to end.           85           86       No further matter was discussed.           87           88       The meeting adjourned at 2:45 p.m.           89           90   Prepared by:                                       Noted by:           91           92           93   JESSIE ANNE T.

And, they all agreed with Prof. Sedigo.           62           63       As  to  midterm  examination,  Prof.  Sedigo  reminded  all  faculty  to  prepare  and  submit  their           64   midterm examinations with TOS to their respective Department Chairs at least two weeks before the           65   scheduled exam for review and approval before reproduction.           66           67       The University Games and as well as Foundation Day are yet to be rescheduled per campus.           68   However,  for T3 campuses,  it  was agreed  to  have a  temporary  schedule  for the  foundation  day           69   celebrations and solidarity programs as follows: Trece: May 6, 2020; Tanza: May 7, 2020, and Gentri:           70   May 8, 2020.           71           72       Prof. Noel A.

Ms. Anonas said she had already done the counterchecking of the           75   master  list.  She  even  visited  the  Gen.  Trias  City  campus  to  ensure  the  records'  accuracy  to  be           76   submitted at the main campus. Likewise, all OSAS Head and CSG advisers are requested to process           77   the students' insurance as soon as possible.           78           79       Prof. Sedigo also reminded the permanent, temporary, and casual faculty and staff to submit PDS           80   and SALN to the HR Coordinator to be submitted on or before March 16, 2020, at the main campus.           81           82       As per Prof. Sedigo, Flexi-time is still up, and the use of biometrics is always encouraged. He           83   requested Dr. Demetillo to prepare a letter to ask the qualified T3 personnel to allow Flexi-time           84   because of the other designations they have. Prof. Sedigo also informed Ms. Hosmillo to request a           85   new biometric for Trece Campus since it is no longer working.           86           87       Mr. Laynes reiterated  that Gentri Campus  could hardly impose  the solid waste management           88   program since they are occupying three locations. The guards could barely monitor the students'           89   activities in disposing of their garbage.           90       Prof. Sedigo reminds Ms. Manlapig to remind the canteen owners about garbage disposal and           91   Ms. Lontoc, Mr. Cajigas, and Mr. Laynes to monitor solid waste management for each campus.           92           93       Mr. Cajigas requested for a truck and driver to pick up the chairs in Las Pinas donated by the           94   concerned foundation.

Rationale                               The population explosion in Brgy. Bagtas has led to an initiative to alleviate                         poverty in the barangay. Brgy. Bagtas, having the most population in Tanza (20,370                         out of 188,755), has been the site for relocation and reclamation. However, people,                         who were displaced out of their previous addresses, were relocated in the said barangay                         without having a regular source of living. Some of them could not find a decent job                         because they lack the educational and other requirements for the job that they were","applying  for.  Others  could  not  start  any  business  because  they  lack  the  skills  in                         preparing innovative products that could help them earn additional income for their                         families.                                 Thus, different extension activities are being proposed to increase the quality of                         life of the citizens in the said barangay. Non-formal education will help out-of-school                         children to be able to read, write and count. Also, livelihood programs are deemed to                         strengthen housewives’ skills and at the same time, augment the meager income of                         their families. In addition, awareness drives concerning health and other GAD-related                         issues are being proposed to inculcate the importance of appropriate living conditions                         for every member of the community.                      III.   Strategies of Implementation                           A.  Formation of Committee                                       A committee was formed to study and gather benchmark information                               on the status, needs, and conditions of selected communities in Tanza, Cavite                               during the second semester, AY 2014 – 2015. The committee was headed by                               the  Extension  Coordinator.  Two  faculty  members  from  the  different                               departments of the campus were selected as members of the committee to                               ensure that the programs will conform to the mandate of the university. The                               committee  used  the  following  benchmark  information,  provided  by  Tanza                               Municipal Planning and Development Office (TMPDO), in order to assess                               which group of individuals will be the target beneficiaries of the proposal.

Data utilized in                               the  study  mainly  came  from  the  responses  on  the  self-administered  survey                               questions that were distributed to the residents of Brgy. Bagtas. Residents were                               selected using simple random sampling.","Results revealed that:                                       •  87.14% of the residents perceived that they lack regular sources of                                          living  in  the  barangay  because  most  (48.15%)  of  them  lack  the                                          educational  requirements  and  some  (38.99%)  lack  the  technical                                          skills to either start a small business or to apply for a regular job;                                      •  47.06% of the residents believed that these problems and issues may                                          be  addressed  through  conduct  of  free  seminars/trainings  on                                          livelihood programs;                                       •  47.06% of the residents believed that these problems and issues may                                          be  addressed  through  conduct  of  free  seminars/trainings  on                                          livelihood programs;                                       •  47.06% of the residents believed that these problems and issues may                                          be  addressed  through  conduct  of  free  seminars/trainings  on                                          livelihood programs;                            B.  Preparation of Committee                                       The  proposal  to  conduct  extension  programs  in  the  community  was                               based upon the respondent’s needs and interests that are consistent with the                               goals of the campus and that have been identified through surveys.                                      Some programs relative to the needs and interests of the residents were                               not  considered  due  to  insufficiencies  on  facilities  and  absence  of  qualified                               faculty members to handle such programs. This includes recycling of plastic                               products, water lily bags, and perfume-making which may require raw materials                               that are unavailable from the community.                                      While having consultative meetings with the local government of the                               concerned  barangay,  some  requests  to  the  university  were  raised.  First,  the                               campus  will  have  to  offer  a  computer  literacy  program  for  their  barangay                               officials and 4P’s members. This program aims to extend computer literacy to                               the Brgy. Officials and selected 4P’s members, who, based on observation, lack                               sufficient skills in computer manipulation and processes. The LGU believes that                               technical  skills  must  be  manifested  by  their  officials  to  better  serve  their                               constituents  and  for  those  4P’s  members  for  employment  and  business                               opportunities.                                       Also,  the  LGU  requested  that  the  proponents  offer  literacy  skills                               development among their children. According to them, a number of children                               were not enrolled in a formal school and parents of these children affirm that                               they could not send them to formal school due to lack of financial resources,                               that although education is free in public schools, they could not provide the                               requirements that their children must submit.                                       Another  request  from  the  LGU  is  that  the  proponent  should  give                               awareness campaigns on different health issues. According to them, the increase                               in the rate of patients with dengue and AIDS/HIV in the province had been                               alarming them and the residents. And because the proponent is a GAD advocate,                               GAD-related issues and concerns were included in this awareness campaign,                               such as Anti-Violence against Women and their Children (anti-VAWC), sexual                               harassment among others.","C.  Meeting of the Committee                                      A meeting of the campus Committee on Curriculum and Instruction                               was conducted on April 10, 2015 to deliberate on the proposed extension                               programs in the campus.

Bagtas has led to an initiative to alleviate                 poverty  In  the  barangay.  Brgy.  Bagtas,  having  the  most  number  of  populations  in                Tanza  (20,370  out  of  188,755),  has  been  the  site  for  relocation  and  reclamation.                 However, people, who were displaced out of their previous addresses, were relocated                 in the said barangay without having a regular source of living. Some of them could not                find a decent job because they lack the educational and other requirements for the job                 that they were applying for. Others could not start any business because they lack the                skills in preparing innovative products that could help them earn additional income for                 their families.                          Thus,  Cavite  State  University  –  Tanza  Campus  shall  launch  a  full  blown                 extension program through the Research and Extension Office. The campus extension                program  shall  be  called  as  “BAGTAS  with  CvSU  –  Tanza  (Bagtas  ay  Aasenso  at                 Giginhawa kung Tayo Ay Sama-sama with CvSU – Tanza)\". The main goal of the                program is to increase the quality of life of the citizens in the said barangay.                           For  this  reason,  it  is  essential  to  conduct  a  Community  Needs  Assessment                (CNA) aiming to identify the needs in order to provide appropriate services to those                 needs.  CNA  will  provide  database  information  on  the  current  status  of  each                community.  The  study  will  also  be  able  to  provide  a  framework  for  identifying                 appropriate community, profiling of their needs, and provide a sustainable extension                program to meet specific needs.                          Cavite State University – Tanza Campus is located in Tanza, Cavite so, the                 extension  unit  has  chosen  one  of  the  barangays  in  Tanza  to  be  adopted  for  its                 extension activities. It adopted barangay Bagtas since this is the barangay that has                the most number of populations in the Municipality of Tanza.","Results and Quantitative Summary of Community Needs Assessment                         A committee was formed to study and gather benchmark information on the                status, needs, and conditions of selected communities in Tanza, Cavite during the                 second  semester,  AY  2014  –  2015.
