These trends are significant to meet                the future needs and challenges in education through the pervasive application of Information and                Communication Technology (ICT).  In addition, the emergence of COVID-19 pandemic and the                imminent presence of different COVID-19 variants (Delta) brought unforeseen disruptions in                the lives of people all over the world.  The Philippine higher education institutions (HEIs) are                no exemption in facing such critical situations.  To ensure the continuity of learning among                tertiary students while avoiding and/or limiting the risks of infection in the community, HEIs                explored and shifted to other innovative learning modalities that transmigrate the conduct of                classes  from  traditional  to  flexible  learning  modalities,  which  gave  students  the  option  to                choose the most convenient delivery modes to them.  This flexible learning modality emerged                during the First Semester of Academic Year 2020–2021 where it was used for the conduct of                lecture classes, leaving behind the conduct of laboratory classes that require a more rigid                training for students in face-to-face classes.                         As CvSU Tanza increases its enrolment during the First Semester of AY 2021 – 2022, from                1,154 students last year now caters a projected 1700 enrollees, thus compelling the campus to                hire additional faculty members. With this, there is an urgent need to conduct faculty orientation                and re-orientation and further explore other innovative flexible learning modalities that suit the                capacity, capability, and connectivity of our teachers and learners.                 Objectives                        The activity aims to provide our faculty members with additional information and enhance                different ways on  flexible  learning  modality of education delivery  with  the aid of  ICT and new                technologies.

The seminar was ended with the closing statement of Ms. Joyce                 Erika S. Senaris, DIT Chairperson, who said that as an educator, it is the                 obligation of faculty members to continuously enrich their capability  as                 change is inevitable as well as the dimension of education. It was a great                 opportunity  to  expose  the  faculty  members  to  various  enhancement                 training  that  will  ensure  their  preparedness  and  be  able  to  fill  in  the                  demands of higher education.","PHOTO DOCUMENTATION                                                          Dr. Noel B.

Before                    he officially discussed the main agenda of the meeting, he commended the group for the good                    feedback  the  campus  received  during  the  recently  held  commencement  exercises.  He  also                    congratulated the faculty members who will be promoted with the NBC 461 8  Cycle and thanked                                                                                           th                    Ms. Sebastian for her time and effort in assisting the faculty members in preparing and submitting                    the necessary documents for NBC.                           The meeting then proceeded to the main agenda. He asked the chairs of each department                    to report. Mr. Banate, the department chair of the Department of Management reported that one                    of the recently hired faculty members of their department has backed out and they already posted                    a hiring notice. However, they only got one applicant. Prof. Ramos advised to welcome even fresh                    graduates to apply, especially those who graduated with honors.                           Ms. Senaris, the chair of the Department of Information Technology, then reported that                    they already successfully filled the necessary number of faculty members in the department. Ms.                    Sebastian, the chair of the Teacher Education Department also reported that they already have","complete number of faculty members. She then opened her concern about the deployment of their                    students as practice teachers for face-to-face teaching. She asked if they can hold a face-to-face                    demonstration teaching in the campus for them to assess their students’ readiness, knowledge,                    and skills in actual teaching, before their deployment. This will be held for 3 days, with 42 Education                    students and they plan to start the activity the following week. Prof. Ramos approved the request                    and advised that they may not deploy the students who will not pass their assessment.                           Ms. Fabian then reported about the recruitment of faculty members for the Department of                    Arts and Sciences being completed. She also said that the Job Order faculty members especially                    the newly hired should submit their requirements as soon as possible for their contracts.                           In  line  with  the  preparation  of  the  opening  of  classes,  Prof.  Ramos  asked  the  faculty                    members to follow the prescribed syllabus in their handled courses. He then asked Ms. Sebastian                    about  any  updates  regarding  the  NBC.  Ms.  Sebastian  told  the  group  that  those  who  will  be                    promoted to one to three steps are already certain of the reclassification while those who will be                    promoted to at least four steps will still wait for BOR approval.                           The meeting then proceeded to the next agenda which is the admission and enrolment.                    Ms. Perida, the campus registrar, reported that there are 556 qualified first year students who                    already confirmed their slots but only 369 of them submitted the necessary requirements. Prof.                    Ramos then asked Ms. Perida to extend the deadline of requirements until September 16, 2022,                    Friday. Ms. Perida then added that there are already 1200 old students enrolled. She also reported                    that there are four students who requested transfer credentials to transfer to CvSU-Cavite City                    campus but currently requesting to return to the campus because they were not able to secure                    their slots in Cavite City. However, because their transfer credentials were already signed and                    released, their request to return were not granted.                           Prof. Ramos then opened the next agenda which is the campus designation. He told the                    group that the campus needs reappointment of designations. First, he will be the department chair                    of the Department of Arts and Sciences but Mr. Mark Joel Sibulo will help him perform his duties                    as chair. Second, Ms. Sebastian will still be the research coordinator of the campus. He then told                    the group to include the performance of their designations as one of their priorities. He announced                    that Dr. Polinga already approved the designation of the staff to administrative positions.                           He also announced that the campus will no longer have an official campus vehicle because                    he already returned it to the main campus. Proceeding to the next agenda, he asked TED to get                    an update about English Critic accreditation to have additional accredited English Critic in the                    campus.                           For the next agenda, he announced that it was already allowed to use textbooks and he                    suggested  that  the  campus  sell  textbooks  as  an  income-generating  project.  Prof.  Ramos                    recommended his books to be sold but reminded that the students should not be required to buy                    the textbooks that the campus will sell.                           Prof.  Ramos  shared  to  the  group  that  the  main  campus  will  be  having  an  extension                    program in Brgy. Bagtas which is planting kaong. They plan to hold a transfer of technology to                    Bagtas  residents,  specifically  the  production  of  vinegar  and  sugar  from  kaong.  Prof.  Ramos                    suggested that the campus anchor its extension program to this activity of the main campus.                    However, Ms. Villa, the extension program coordinator of the campus told the group that there is                    already an approved campus extension program.                           Other matters discussed during the meeting includes the request of Prof. Ramos to have                    a copy of the raw data of the monthly attendance report of the faculty. He added that in line with                    the  new  HR  Memo  on  work  arrangement,  the  faculty  members  will  continue  to  follow  their                    alternative work arrangement schedule (two days WFH and two days campus reporting) while the                    non-academic staff will be reporting to the campus four days a week. He then announced that Ms.                    Fabian and Mr. Fred will be the liaison officers.                           After this, Prof. Ramos shared some reminders for the opening of classes. He reminded                    the group to be not too lenient to the students. With this, Ms. Sebastian shared that the TED will                    be starting to require student attendance to class meetings.                           The meeting adjourned at 2:54 PM.","Prepared by:                                   Certified Correct:                      CHARMAINE T. BANAG                             GIL D.

Before                    he officially discussed the main agenda of the meeting, he requested Mr. Crisostomo Sibulo to                    lead a prayer. After this, he go through the agenda of the meeting.                           He asked the group about the status of preparation for COPC. Ms. Sebastian reported that                    the preparation is already 80% completed but they are having problems with the facility of the                    campus. She proposed that the faculty room be used as laboratory and lecture rooms. The campus                    was able to borrow 30 computers from the students and proposed to have a memorandum of                    agreement with Bagtas Elementary School and Tanza National Trade School for borrowing of                    additional computers.                           Prof. Ramos opened the concern about the P5,000 being requested by the Department of                    Information Technology for the installation of tiles in the computer laboratory and shared to the                    group that he already asked Dr. Manuel about it and was told that the requested improvement is                    not required. He then asked about update on the requested purchase of equipment and facilities                    for accreditation. Ms. Sebastian reported that Dr. Polinga held over the purchase request because                    the campus has no available space. Prof. Ramos then told the group that because there is lack of                    support from the administration, the campus can document whatever is available in the campus                    and use the result of evaluation as the basis of what to improve in the campus. After this, Ms.                    Senaris shared the problem of the department about the lack of faculty member with master’s                    degree and reported that she included Ms. Lewis from Trece Martires City Campus to the list of                    faculty.                           Prof. Ramos then shared that the donated lot for Tanza Campus was already presented                    during the academic council meeting. He also shared to the group that he already requested to                    the OVPAA that the campus will continue to hold online classes because of the lack of campus                    facilities. Mr. Mark Sibulo then asked if there is already a target date of constructing the new","campus  building.  Prof.  Ramos  answered  that  there  is  still  no  concrete  schedule  about  the                    construction.                           Mr. Banate then reported about their department’s preparation for COPC. He shared that                    he is already finalizing the presentation and was able to borrow faculty from the main campus                    resulting to 84% faculty members having master’s degree. He then told Prof. Ramos that Mr.                    Mintu,  the  Brgy.  Bagtas  Chairperson,  is  asking  about  the  schedule  of  MOA  signing  with  the                    University for the lot donated to Tanza campus. Prof. Ramos said that it is still on process of                    approval.                           Prof. Ramos then shared that the mock presentation of TED for COPC was postponed but                    each department should continue their preparation. He also reminded the group to just present                    what is available in the campus. He then asked for understanding for not being able to go to the                    campus for health concerns and thanked the group for all their efforts.                           After this, Ms. Banag presented the proposed streamlined designations.                           Ms. Fabian then reminded the Contract of Service faculty members to submit authority to                    go two days before the schedule because it needs to be submitted to different offices.                           Prof. Ramos shared that the campus is not oblige to conduct a face-to-face class and to                    be able to implement limited face-to-face, the campus must submit the necessary documents for                    application  for  F2F  and  approval  from  the  LGU  is  also  necessary.  The  faculty  members  and                    students must also be fully vaccinated and the students should have their parent’s consent.

EDFS 21 is offered during the current semester, and EDFS 22 will be offered during          69        the Midyear Term.          70          71               Ms. Maria Kristina Galicha announced that she attended the meeting for BSHM/BSTM          72        programs.  They were able to formulate the proposal and guidelines for the virtual OJT but like          73        the  other  programs,  the  proposal  is  yet  to  be  approved  and  further  information  shall  be          74        announced sooner or later, depending on the results of the approval of the proposal.  Working          75        students whose nature of jobs are aligned with their program of course may seek for credit of          76        their OJT as long as the competencies for a particular skill are achieved.  In addition, Ms.          77        Elamparo mentioned that BSHM/BSTM students who wished to conduct the OJT shall pay a          78        minimum amount of PhP4,000 to complete their virtual OJT.  Due to this, she made a poll with          79        the BSHM students if ever they would pursue the virtual OJT and pay the necessary amount.          80        Based on the results, most of the students signified their non-intention to pursue the virtual          81        OJT due to financial constraints.          82          83               Prof. Ramos announced that the CHED is now offering Scholarships for Instructors'          84        Knowledge Advancement Program (SIKAP) for faculty members who wish to pursue graduate          85        degree programs in CHED recognized schools. He mentioned that CHED Region IV-A Director          86        Amelia Biglete encouraged everyone to pursue graduate degree programs in universities in          87        the  CALABARZON  region.     Faculty  members  can  visit  the  CHED  website  for  further          88        information.          89          90               Prof.  Ramos  announced  that  as  per  Director  Biglete,  the  First  National  Higher          91        Education Day of the Commission on Higher Education will be held on May 7-21, 2021.  He          92        will be sending the memorandum from the CHED in the group chat of the campus, where each          93        campus of the university shall be enjoined to attend and participate.          94          95               Prof. Ramos inquired about the preparation of the documents relative to the COPC          96        application of the campus.  The College of Education, Office of the Graduate School, Naic          97        Campus and Carmona Campus had already finished the virtual validation.  Prof. Sebastian          98        mentioned that the preparation of the said documents is on-going. There have been some          99        problems encountered as regards some supplies and materials relative to the preparation.         100        Prof. Ramos pledged that the funds shall be available in terms of the campus cash advance.         101        However, Ms. Noemi Perida mentioned that she encountered difficulties in canvassing some         102        supplies and materials because there was a tight budget.  Prof. Sebastian made mentioned         103        that  the  group  also  find  it  difficult  to  get  certified  copies  of  faculty  credentials  since  the         104        University Records Office does not certify copies of TOR and diploma who are not graduates         105        of the university.  Also, faculty members cannot be compelled to travel and get their TOR and         106        diploma as certified true copy.         107         108               Prof. Ramos announced that the class observation shall push through as planned.  This         109        will be from May 10 – 13, 2021.  This shall serve as one of the evaluation requirements for re-         110        hiring of faculty members.         111         112               Prof. Ramos was happy to know that every permanent and temporary faculty members         113        are enjoying their workload.  He also announced that the deadline of submission for the Unified","114        Workload  System  will  be  June  10,  2021  and  no  more  extension  shall  be  given.    Faculty         115        members who are entitled to workload credits are advised to submit their workload documents         116        before June 10, 2021 to avoid non-inclusion in the evaluation.         117         118               The admission of new students in the main campus already reached the 18,000-mark.         119        However, they could only accommodate a total of 6,200 students in the different programs         120        offered in the university. Those who will not qualify in the main campus will be transferred in         121        the satellite campuses.         122         123               The meeting adjourned at 5:30 PM.         124         125         126        Prepared by:                                   Certified Correct:         127         128         129        MILDRED A.

Before          54        he officially discussed the main agenda of the meeting, he had some announcements for the          55        group based on the administrative council meeting that was held the other day.  He announced          56        that the campus water supply will be provided by the Office of the ABC President, Hon. SM","57        Matro.  He also announced that the PhP4.5-million allotment for the two-storey building of          58        CvSU Tanza Campus has been approved and that the group could expect its construction in          59        the near future.  He further announced that the PhP50-million allotment for the 3-5 storey          60        building of the campus has been approved.  The campus shall seek the assistance of the          61        Bagtas LGU for any donation of land to realize this vision, especially when the campus shall          62        be subjecting four of its programs under the CHED visit to obtain the Certificates of Program          63        Compliance.          64          65               Another  concern  that  was  being  raised  during  the  Administrative  Council  was  the          66        complaints through the 8888.  Most of Contract of Service (COS) Faculty members were filing          67        concerns regarding the delay of salaries.  He sympathized with those faculty members but he          68        mentioned that these faculty members must expedite all possible means to complete their          69        requirements in order not to delay their salaries.          70          71               He  announced  that  each  faculty  member  shall  give  major  examinations,  such  as          72        midterm and final exams in line with the school calendar.  However, faculty members shall          73        have the leeway on when to give their midterm examination, depending on the lessons that          74        were already discussed.          75          76               Prof. Ramos shared to the group that there was an alleged Diploma Factory in Tanza,          77        being posted in the Facebook. This was discussed during the Administrative Council Meeting.          78        He  requested  everyone  to  help  the  campus  in  tracking  down  the  source  or  production  of          79        falsified documents.          80          81               He announced that there will be also class observation after the midterm examination.          82        He requested everyone to submit their schedule of classes for the classroom observation.  This          83        shall be the basis for re-hiring of faculty members for the next semester.          84          85               He  announced  that  the  Office  of  the  University  President  request  each  campus  to          86        prepare  its  dashboard  of  information.

He assigned the MIS officer and the four department          88        chairpersons to take charge of this task.          89          90               The Socio-Cultural Development Coordinator presented the proposed Socio-Cultural          91        Activities happening on May 17 – 21, 2021.

Submission of requirements (Grades, teaching portfolio, etc.)           29           30       Prof. Noel A. Sedigo, informed everyone to comply with the health protocols inside the campus           31   strictly. The security guards were oriented to check every employee's temperature coming in and           32   reminded them to use alcohol to sanitize their hands and of the visitors upon entering the campus           33   premises. Likewise the so-called social distancing should be strictly imposed. Further, he emphasized           34   that  each  campus  will  undergo  an  immediate  disinfection  with  the  help  of  the  campus  utility           35   personnel.           36           37       Each faculty member is advised by Prof. Sedigo to prepare the course syllabus as early as now. He           38   reminded all department chairs to give all faculty loads so that they can prepare course syllabi and           39   modules, which is due on July 30, 2020. Mr. Luke Ty presented a lecture on how to design course           40   syllabi and modules applicable in today's new normal environment. The approach is blended, online,           41   and modular.           42           43       Prof.  Sedigo  suggested  to  the  faculty  to  be  clear  about  the  references.  References  must  be           44   coordinated with the campus librarian for listing and acquisition of books. Ms. Villarante, the campus           45   librarian, agreed and added that references, particularly electronic references, will be incorporated           46   into the campus e-library.           47           48       Ms. Noemi Perida clarifies if possible to allow second-year students (HM and IT) to apply for           49   graduation or  proceed  for  a  BS  degree. Prof.  Sedigo  responded  with, \"yes  they  can.\"  He  further           50   reminded everyone that T3 Campuses would not be having midyear classes for 2020. Ms. Feranail           51   added that the students in the following semesters could take those subjects scheduled for midyear           52   class 2020.           53","54       Regarding workload, Mr. Ritch Banate and Prof. Arlene Estrada confirmed that they had already           55   given the subjects to be taught by each of the faculty members under their departments. Likewise,           56   all other department chairs also assured that they already distributed subjects to the respective           57   faculty members under their department.           58           59       Prof. Sedigo announced to submit requirements or faculty portfolios before the deadline to avoid           60   the  salary  delay.  He  likewise  asked  why  most  of  Trece  Campus  faculty  members  have  not  yet           61   submitted their grading sheets. Some answered that they still need to get their student files and           62   records from the campus to do so.           63           64       Also, Prof. Sedigo reminded the department chairs and HR coordinators to finalize the number of           65   faculty to be hired this First Semester AY 2020-2021 and in as much as possible consider those with           66   masters’ degree and as well as doctors’ degree. This is in consideration for bolstering the faculty           67   profile of the campuses and also for long term considerations.           68           69   No further matter was discussed.           70           71   The meeting adjourned at 2:30 p.m.           72           73   Prepared by:                                       Noted by:           74           75           76   JESSIE ANNE T.

Ms. Lontoc added           44   that she already ordered the necessary materials and equipment needed for the three campuses,           45   such  as  face  masks,  alcohol,  temperature  scanner,  etc.  Further,  Prof.  Sedigo  requested  that           46   disinfection for each campus shall be done prior to the reporting of the skeletal force.           47           48   WORKLOAD AND TEACHING ASSIGNMENT           49       Prof. Sedigo asked Prof. Feranil about the status of the Workload and Teaching. Prof. Feranil said           50   that she already distributed the loads to the respective department chairs; however, none of the           51   department chairs submitted the accomplished load assignments.           52","53       Prof. Sedigo calls the attention of Mr. Keno Villavicencio, IT Department Chair, to canvass for           54   Learning  Management  System  Seminars  in  preparation  for  a  blended  teaching  approach.  Mr.           55   Villavicencio  responded  that  he  already  had  contacts  for  MIS  and  need  to  finalize  the  proposal           56   content still.           57           58       Ms. Jelyn Digma suggested that face to face approach can be adopted only for students who do           59   not have internet access.           60           61       Ms. Arlene Estrada said that it is better if the University can develop one uniform module that           62   can be used systemwide.           63           64   REALIGNMENT OF BUDGET           65       Prof. Sedigo instructed the Budget Officers to realign the budget, such as the budget for seminars,           66   trainings, conferences, accreditation, to budget for equipment and other things necessary for the new           67   normal classes.           68           69   GRADES AND TEACHING PORTFOLIO           70       Prof. Sedigo reminded all to submit the grades and teaching portfolio on time to avoid delay on           71   salaries, especially for the faculty with a contract of service status. He instructed all department chairs           72   to check all the requirements of faculty upon submission.           73           74   HEALTH PROTOCOLS           75       Dr. Demetillo, T3 Secretary, presented some of the health protocols and preventive measures           76   against COVID 19 to the T3 campuses key officials. Prof. Sedigo advised Ms. Lontoc to facilitate the           77   purchase  request  of  alcohol,  masks,  temperature  scanners,  foot  disinfectant  mats,  etc.  for  T3           78   campuses.  He  likewise  instructed  the  campus  coordinators  to  help  monitor  in  ensuring  the           79   compliance of the mentioned health protocols. Ms. Lontoc responded and she said that she will do it           80   immediately.           81           82   OTHER MATTERS           83       Prof.  Sedigo  reminded  HR  coordinators  to  prepare  a  recommendation  letter  to  rehire  non-           84   teaching personal with a contract about to end.           85           86       No further matter was discussed.           87           88       The meeting adjourned at 2:45 p.m.           89           90   Prepared by:                                       Noted by:           91           92           93   JESSIE ANNE T.

And, they all agreed with Prof. Sedigo.           62           63       As  to  midterm  examination,  Prof.  Sedigo  reminded  all  faculty  to  prepare  and  submit  their           64   midterm examinations with TOS to their respective Department Chairs at least two weeks before the           65   scheduled exam for review and approval before reproduction.           66           67       The University Games and as well as Foundation Day are yet to be rescheduled per campus.           68   However,  for T3 campuses,  it  was agreed  to  have a  temporary  schedule  for the  foundation  day           69   celebrations and solidarity programs as follows: Trece: May 6, 2020; Tanza: May 7, 2020, and Gentri:           70   May 8, 2020.           71           72       Prof. Noel A. Sedigo calls the attention of Ms. Mary Ann L. Anonas, T3 registrar, and the rest of           73   the registrar aid to do the counterchecking of the Master List to ensure correct billing as to the           74   number of the enrolled students. Ms. Anonas said she had already done the counterchecking of the           75   master  list.  She  even  visited  the  Gen.  Trias  City  campus  to  ensure  the  records'  accuracy  to  be           76   submitted at the main campus. Likewise, all OSAS Head and CSG advisers are requested to process           77   the students' insurance as soon as possible.           78           79       Prof. Sedigo also reminded the permanent, temporary, and casual faculty and staff to submit PDS           80   and SALN to the HR Coordinator to be submitted on or before March 16, 2020, at the main campus.           81           82       As per Prof. Sedigo, Flexi-time is still up, and the use of biometrics is always encouraged. He           83   requested Dr. Demetillo to prepare a letter to ask the qualified T3 personnel to allow Flexi-time           84   because of the other designations they have. Prof. Sedigo also informed Ms. Hosmillo to request a           85   new biometric for Trece Campus since it is no longer working.           86           87       Mr. Laynes reiterated  that Gentri Campus  could hardly impose  the solid waste management           88   program since they are occupying three locations. The guards could barely monitor the students'           89   activities in disposing of their garbage.           90       Prof. Sedigo reminds Ms. Manlapig to remind the canteen owners about garbage disposal and           91   Ms. Lontoc, Mr. Cajigas, and Mr. Laynes to monitor solid waste management for each campus.           92           93       Mr. Cajigas requested for a truck and driver to pick up the chairs in Las Pinas donated by the           94   concerned foundation. Prof. Sedigo asked John to coordinated the said request to the main campus.           95           96   No further matter was discussed.           97           98   The meeting adjourned at 2:15 p.m.           99         100    Prepared by:                                       Noted by:         101         102         103    JESSIE ANNE T.

Bagtas has led to an initiative to alleviate                poverty  in  the  barangay.  Brgy.  Bagtas,  having  the  most  number  of  populations  in                 Tanza  (20,370  out  of  188,755),  has  been  the  site  for  relocation  and  reclamation.                However, people, who were displaced out of their previous addresses, were relocated                 in the said barangay without having a regular source of living. Some of them could not                 find a decent job because they lack the educational and other requirements for the job                that they were applying for. Others could not start any business because they lack the                 skills in preparing innovative products that could help them earn additional income for                their families.                         Thus,  Cavite  State  University  –  Tanza  Campus  shall  launch  a  full-blown                extension program through the Research and Extension Office. The campus extension                 program shall be called as “BAGTAS with CvSU – Tanza (Bagtas ay Aasenso at                 Giginhawa kung Tayo Ay Sama-sama with CvSU – Tanza)”. The main goal of the                program is to increase the quality of life of the citizens in the said barangay.                         For  this  reason,  it  is  essential  to  conduct  a  Community  Needs  Assessment                 (CNA) aiming to identify the needs in order to provide appropriate services to those                needs.  CNA  will  provide  database  information  on  the  current  status  of  each                 community.  The  study  will  also  be  able  to  provide  a  framework  for  identifying                appropriate  community,  profiling  of  their  needs,  and  provide  sustainable  extension                 program to meet specific needs.                        Cavite State University – Tanza Campus is located in Tanza, Cavite so, the                 extension  unit  has  chosen  one  of  the  barangays  in  Tanza  to  be  adopted  for  its                 extension activities. It adopted barangay Bagtas since this is the barangay that has                the most number of populations in the Municipality of Tanza.","Results and Quantitative Summary of Community Needs Assessment                        A committee was formed to study and gather benchmark information on the                 status, needs, and conditions of selected communities in Tanza, Cavite during the                second  semester,  AY  2014  –  2015.  The  committee  was  headed  by  the  Extension                 Coordinator. Two faculty members from the different departments of the campus were                 selected as members of the committee to ensure that the programs will conform to the                mandate of the university. The committee used the following benchmark information,                 provided by Tanza Municipal Planning and Development Office (TMPDO), in order to                assess which group of individuals will be the target beneficiaries of the proposal.

The activity was headed by the campus extension coordinator, Ms. Mildred A.                 Sebastian. The officers and members of different student organization such as CSG,                 FAME, COPE and CSS, assisted in conducting interviews among the residents of the                community. The event was also participated by the other faculty members and key                 officials of the campus.                          The needs assessment was done to address the needs, problems or gaps                 between current conditions and desired conditions of the community. This also helps                to identify the strengths and resources available in the community to meet the needs                 of the children, youth and families. This assessment pays particular attention to the                capabilities of the community, including its citizens, agencies, and local organizations.                           Prior  to  the  needs  assessment,  the  extension  coordinator  talked  to  the                barangay captain over the phone, to offer an extension project that can cater the                 needs of the community. The barangay captain was overwhelmed to hear that the                campus will help them to alleviate poverty in the barangay through this extension                 project. He also said that he is really willing to provide any assistance for the success                 of the project.                          As the interview and needs assessment started, one of the barangay staff also                accompanied  the  group  in  going  to  the  houses  of  the  residents.  Prepared                 questionnaires were used during the interview. The assessment went well because                 the interviewees were very cooperative. It was indeed a productive day for the group.","Certificate of appearance which was duly signed by the barangay captain was                 issued to the interviewers.

Before the start of the classes, the campus also posted announcements on its Facebook                 page to increase the number of ALS enrollees. During the orientation, 29 ALS enrollees                attended the orientation. These 29 enrollees are composed of out-of-school youths and adults                 who wished to finish their secondary education. The ALS orientation was attended by the                faculty members of the campus, Dep-Ed ALS representative and the barangay chairperson                 and his staff.                        During the first class of ALS students, Ms. Mildred A. Sebastian, chairperson of TED,                 served as the lecturer for Mathematics lesson and digital literacy at the same time. Other faculty                 members served as the lecturers in the succeeding days of ALS classes. Ms. Charmaine T.                Banag served as the lecturer for Digital Literacy. Dr. Noel B. Manarpiis served as the lecturer                 for English and Communication subjects. Mr. Melandro F. Soriano, pre-service teacher, served                as the Science teacher.                           During the two weeks of ALS classes, it was observed that the ALS students really","enjoyed the classes based on the feedback evaluation given to them after every class. According                 to  one  of  the  students,  he  was  amazed  on  how  the  teachers  teach  the  lessons  and  their                approaches to them. He had stopped because his high school teachers reprimanded him inside                 the class that led him to traumatic experience. Because of that, he refused to go to school and                worked in a construction firm instead. But now, his perspective in life had changed because of                 the treatment of the faculty members they received. It is good to know that his program really                 changes the perspective of these former out-of-school youths.                          The ALS students also experienced how to use computer through their digital literacy                subject. They were also taught how to express themselves as some of them have very low self-                 esteem due to their level of education. Dr. Manarpiis taught them some tips on how to become                a confident English language speaker.                          The Extension Services Unit of the campus will ensure that they will provide the needs                 of the students in order for them to receive the quality of education they deserve.
