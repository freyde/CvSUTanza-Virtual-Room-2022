               Title:   Virtual Teachers’ Orientation and Capability Enhancement Seminar Workshop


               Rationale

                       The Higher Education 4.0 trends and future perspectives for teaching and learning are
               equally affected by the rapid changes we are facing today. These trends are significant to meet
               the future needs and challenges in education through the pervasive application of Information and
               Communication Technology (ICT).  In addition, the emergence of COVID-19 pandemic and the
               imminent presence of different COVID-19 variants (Delta) brought unforeseen disruptions in
               the lives of people all over the world.  The Philippine higher education institutions (HEIs) are
               no exemption in facing such critical situations.  To ensure the continuity of learning among
               tertiary students while avoiding and/or limiting the risks of infection in the community, HEIs
               explored and shifted to other innovative learning modalities that transmigrate the conduct of
               classes  from  traditional  to  flexible  learning  modalities,  which  gave  students  the  option  to
               choose the most convenient delivery modes to them.  This flexible learning modality emerged
               during the First Semester of Academic Year 2020–2021 where it was used for the conduct of
               lecture classes, leaving behind the conduct of laboratory classes that require a more rigid
               training for students in face-to-face classes.

                       As CvSU Tanza increases its enrolment during the First Semester of AY 2021 – 2022, from
               1,154 students last year now caters a projected 1700 enrollees, thus compelling the campus to
               hire additional faculty members. With this, there is an urgent need to conduct faculty orientation
               and re-orientation and further explore other innovative flexible learning modalities that suit the
               capacity, capability, and connectivity of our teachers and learners.

               Objectives
                       The activity aims to provide our faculty members with additional information and enhance
               different ways on  flexible  learning  modality of education delivery  with  the aid of  ICT and new
               technologies.


               Implementation
                       The Campus Administrator together with all faculty members will attend the said activity on
               September 2 – 3, 2021 from 1:00pm to 5:00pm via Zoom/WebEx.]]></page><page Index="14"><![CDATA[Program of Activities

               faculty members and staff with gratitude as he witnessed the untiring support and
               whole-hearted dedication of faculty and staff to continue the semester despite the

               current situation of the academic community.
                       Furthermore,  the  old  and  new  faculty  members  were  introduced  by  their

               respective department chairpersons. Each department chairpersons provided a brief

               Mr. Luke Ty about netiquettes in handling online classes.

                       The virtual orientation ended with the closing statement of Mr. Cris Albert P.
               Cajigas, Tanza Campus Coordinator, who said that as the University embraced the

                                                 February 13, 2020

                       Cavite  State  University  –  Tanza  Campus  held  a  capability

               enhancement seminar for teachers at Hostel Tropicana of Cavite State

               University–Main Campus on February 13, 2020. This was conducted to

               provide the faculty members with an additional credential that will certify

               their competence to teach their course effectively. Besides, the training

               aimed to empower faculty members for them to strengthen their sound

               educational  principles  and  the  capacity  and  willingness  to  transform

               others and one’s self. The program started with a prayer led by Mr. Mark

               Joel C. Sibulo and followed by the AVP of the National Anthem.

                       Meanwhile,  Prof.  Noel  A.  Sedigo,  T3  Campus  Administrator,

               welcomed all the faculty members with confidence as he is certain that

               the  training  will  eventually  gear  them  towards  excellence.  He  firmly

               believed that this training will harness the full potential of faculty members

               in delivering quality instruction to their students.

                       Moreover, Mr. Mark Joel C. Sibulo, Chairperson of the Department

               of Arts and Sciences, presented the CvSU Vision and Mission, and T3

               Campus Goals.  This was followed  by  the presentation  of  Mr.  Ritch  M.

               Banate,  Chairperson  of  the  Department  of  Management  on  program

               educational objectives and outcomes of the various programs offered by

               the Campus.

                       After  that,  the  training  on  teaching  strategies  and  classroom

               management was facilitated by Dr. Noel B. Manarpiis. During the training,]]></page><page Index="32"><![CDATA[each faculty member learned effective ways on how to manage their class

               and teaching strategies that will help them deliver quality instruction.

                       Furthermore, Prof. Arlene L. Estrada, GAD Coordinator, discussed

               the integration of gender-fair language on course syllabi which is really

               vital to ensure gender-responsive and sensitive instruction. In connection

               with this, Ms. Shaine C. Hayag, HR Coordinator of CvSU – General Trias

               Campus discussed the code of conduct and ethical standards for public

               officials and employees to ensure that employees always observed the

               mandates.

                       Additionally, Mr. Keno A. Villavicencio, DIT Chairperson of CvSU –

               Trece Martires City Campus facilitated the training on technology-aided

               education which was followed by the training on course syllabus facilitated

               by Prof. Mildred A. Sebastian, TED Chairperson.

                       Also, Ms. Gerry Mae T. Silvero, tackled test construction, and table

               of specifications. It was followed by the discussion of Ms. Ivory Mojica

               about  rubrics  preparation.  A  workshop  was  conducted  right  after  their

               presentations for the faculty members to create their own exam with TOS

               and sample rubrics where they presented it for enhancement.

                       The seminar was ended with the closing statement of Ms. Joyce

               Erika S. Senaris, DIT Chairperson, who said that as an educator, it is the

               obligation of faculty members to continuously enrich their capability  as

               change is inevitable as well as the dimension of education. It was a great

               opportunity  to  expose  the  faculty  members  to  various  enhancement

               training  that  will  ensure  their  preparedness  and  be  able  to  fill  in  the


               demands of higher education.]]></page><page Index="33"><![CDATA[PHOTO DOCUMENTATION
