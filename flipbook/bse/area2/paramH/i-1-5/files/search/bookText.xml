                   Date          :       29 September 2020


                   Please be informed that starting October 1, 2020, the new mechanism for online time in and
                   out developed by Mr. Jeffrey M. Delgado, one of our DIT faculty from Tanza Campus, will be
                   implemented.  This allows everyone to log in and out our daily time and enables our Local
                   Human  Resource  Coordinator  to  automatically  generate  our  daily  time  records  and  the
                   summary of attendance to be subsequently submitted to the Human Resource Management
                   Office.  Hence, NO DTR shall be submitted by individual faculty and staff every cut-off.

                   However, everyone is enjoined to submit monthly accomplishment report to their respective
                   department chairs every end of the month.

                   For your compliance.

                   Thank you very much.

               Title:   Virtual Teachers’ Orientation and Capability Enhancement Seminar Workshop


               Rationale

                       The Higher Education 4.0 trends and future perspectives for teaching and learning are
               equally affected by the rapid changes we are facing today. These trends are significant to meet
               the future needs and challenges in education through the pervasive application of Information and
               Communication Technology (ICT).  In addition, the emergence of COVID-19 pandemic and the
               imminent presence of different COVID-19 variants (Delta) brought unforeseen disruptions in
               the lives of people all over the world.  The Philippine higher education institutions (HEIs) are
               no exemption in facing such critical situations.  To ensure the continuity of learning among
               tertiary students while avoiding and/or limiting the risks of infection in the community, HEIs
               explored and shifted to other innovative learning modalities that transmigrate the conduct of
               classes  from  traditional  to  flexible  learning  modalities,  which  gave  students  the  option  to
               choose the most convenient delivery modes to them.  This flexible learning modality emerged
               during the First Semester of Academic Year 2020–2021 where it was used for the conduct of
               lecture classes, leaving behind the conduct of laboratory classes that require a more rigid
               training for students in face-to-face classes.

                       As CvSU Tanza increases its enrolment during the First Semester of AY 2021 – 2022, from
               1,154 students last year now caters a projected 1700 enrollees, thus compelling the campus to
               hire additional faculty members. With this, there is an urgent need to conduct faculty orientation
               and re-orientation and further explore other innovative flexible learning modalities that suit the
               capacity, capability, and connectivity of our teachers and learners.

               Objectives
                       The activity aims to provide our faculty members with additional information and enhance
               different ways on  flexible  learning  modality of education delivery  with  the aid of  ICT and new
               technologies.


               Implementation
                       The Campus Administrator together with all faculty members will attend the said activity on
               September 2 – 3, 2021 from 1:00pm to 5:00pm via Zoom/WebEx.]]></page><page Index="49"><![CDATA[Program of Activities

               whole-hearted dedication of faculty and staff to continue the semester despite the

               current situation of the academic community.
                       Furthermore,  the  old  and  new  faculty  members  were  introduced  by  their

               respective department chairpersons. Each department chairpersons provided a brief

               Cajigas, Tanza Campus Coordinator, who said that as the University embraced the

               provide the faculty members with an additional credential that will certify

               their competence to teach their course effectively. Besides, the training

               aimed to empower faculty members for them to strengthen their sound

               educational  principles  and  the  capacity  and  willingness  to  transform

               others and one’s self. The program started with a prayer led by Mr. Mark

               Joel C. Sibulo and followed by the AVP of the National Anthem.

               the  training  will  eventually  gear  them  towards  excellence.  He  firmly

               believed that this training will harness the full potential of faculty members

               in delivering quality instruction to their students.

                       Moreover, Mr. Mark Joel C. Sibulo, Chairperson of the Department

                       Furthermore, Prof. Arlene L. Estrada, GAD Coordinator, discussed

               the integration of gender-fair language on course syllabi which is really

               presentations for the faculty members to create their own exam with TOS

               and sample rubrics where they presented it for enhancement.

                       The seminar was ended with the closing statement of Ms. Joyce

               Erika S. Senaris, DIT Chairperson, who said that as an educator, it is the

               obligation of faculty members to continuously enrich their capability  as

               change is inevitable as well as the dimension of education. It was a great

               opportunity  to  expose  the  faculty  members  to  various  enhancement

               training  that  will  ensure  their  preparedness  and  be  able  to  fill  in  the


               demands of higher education.]]></page><page Index="68"><![CDATA[PHOTO DOCUMENTATION

                          The meeting started at 1:35 PM with Prof. Gil D. Ramos as the presiding officer.  Before
                   he officially discussed the main agenda of the meeting, he commended the group for the good
                   feedback  the  campus  received  during  the  recently  held  commencement  exercises.  He  also
                   congratulated the faculty members who will be promoted with the NBC 461 8  Cycle and thanked
                                                                                          th
                   Ms. Sebastian for her time and effort in assisting the faculty members in preparing and submitting
                   the necessary documents for NBC.
                          The meeting then proceeded to the main agenda. He asked the chairs of each department
                   to report. Mr. Banate, the department chair of the Department of Management reported that one
                   of the recently hired faculty members of their department has backed out and they already posted
                   a hiring notice. However, they only got one applicant. Prof. Ramos advised to welcome even fresh
                   graduates to apply, especially those who graduated with honors.
                          Ms. Senaris, the chair of the Department of Information Technology, then reported that
                   they already successfully filled the necessary number of faculty members in the department. Ms.
                   Sebastian, the chair of the Teacher Education Department also reported that they already have]]></page><page Index="76"><![CDATA[complete number of faculty members. She then opened her concern about the deployment of their
                   students as practice teachers for face-to-face teaching. She asked if they can hold a face-to-face
                   demonstration teaching in the campus for them to assess their students’ readiness, knowledge,
                   and skills in actual teaching, before their deployment. This will be held for 3 days, with 42 Education
                   students and they plan to start the activity the following week. Prof. Ramos approved the request
                   and advised that they may not deploy the students who will not pass their assessment.
                          Ms. Fabian then reported about the recruitment of faculty members for the Department of
                   Arts and Sciences being completed. She also said that the Job Order faculty members especially
                   the newly hired should submit their requirements as soon as possible for their contracts.
                          In  line  with  the  preparation  of  the  opening  of  classes,  Prof.  Ramos  asked  the  faculty
                   members to follow the prescribed syllabus in their handled courses. He then asked Ms. Sebastian
                   about  any  updates  regarding  the  NBC.  Ms.  Sebastian  told  the  group  that  those  who  will  be
                   promoted to one to three steps are already certain of the reclassification while those who will be
                   promoted to at least four steps will still wait for BOR approval.
                          The meeting then proceeded to the next agenda which is the admission and enrolment.
                   Ms. Perida, the campus registrar, reported that there are 556 qualified first year students who
                   already confirmed their slots but only 369 of them submitted the necessary requirements. Prof.
                   Ramos then asked Ms. Perida to extend the deadline of requirements until September 16, 2022,
                   Friday. Ms. Perida then added that there are already 1200 old students enrolled. She also reported
                   that there are four students who requested transfer credentials to transfer to CvSU-Cavite City
                   campus but currently requesting to return to the campus because they were not able to secure
                   their slots in Cavite City. However, because their transfer credentials were already signed and
                   released, their request to return were not granted.
                          Prof. Ramos then opened the next agenda which is the campus designation. He told the
                   group that the campus needs reappointment of designations. First, he will be the department chair
                   of the Department of Arts and Sciences but Mr. Mark Joel Sibulo will help him perform his duties
                   as chair. Second, Ms. Sebastian will still be the research coordinator of the campus. He then told
                   the group to include the performance of their designations as one of their priorities. He announced
                   that Dr. Polinga already approved the designation of the staff to administrative positions.
                          He also announced that the campus will no longer have an official campus vehicle because
                   he already returned it to the main campus. Proceeding to the next agenda, he asked TED to get
                   an update about English Critic accreditation to have additional accredited English Critic in the
                   campus.
                          For the next agenda, he announced that it was already allowed to use textbooks and he
                   suggested  that  the  campus  sell  textbooks  as  an  income-generating  project.  Prof.  Ramos
                   recommended his books to be sold but reminded that the students should not be required to buy
                   the textbooks that the campus will sell.
                          Prof.  Ramos  shared  to  the  group  that  the  main  campus  will  be  having  an  extension
                   program in Brgy. Bagtas which is planting kaong. They plan to hold a transfer of technology to
                   Bagtas  residents,  specifically  the  production  of  vinegar  and  sugar  from  kaong.  Prof.  Ramos
                   suggested that the campus anchor its extension program to this activity of the main campus.
                   However, Ms. Villa, the extension program coordinator of the campus told the group that there is
                   already an approved campus extension program.
                          Other matters discussed during the meeting includes the request of Prof. Ramos to have
                   a copy of the raw data of the monthly attendance report of the faculty. He added that in line with
                   the  new  HR  Memo  on  work  arrangement,  the  faculty  members  will  continue  to  follow  their
                   alternative work arrangement schedule (two days WFH and two days campus reporting) while the
                   non-academic staff will be reporting to the campus four days a week. He then announced that Ms.
                   Fabian and Mr. Fred will be the liaison officers.
                          After this, Prof. Ramos shared some reminders for the opening of classes. He reminded
                   the group to be not too lenient to the students. With this, Ms. Sebastian shared that the TED will
                   be starting to require student attendance to class meetings.
                          The meeting adjourned at 2:54 PM.]]></page><page Index="77"><![CDATA[Prepared by:                                   Certified Correct:

                          The meeting started at 10:00 AM with Prof. Gil D. Ramos as the presiding officer.  Before
                   he officially discussed the main agenda of the meeting, he requested Mr. Crisostomo Sibulo to
                   lead a prayer. After this, he go through the agenda of the meeting.
                          He asked the group about the status of preparation for COPC. Ms. Sebastian reported that
                   the preparation is already 80% completed but they are having problems with the facility of the
                   campus. She proposed that the faculty room be used as laboratory and lecture rooms. The campus
                   was able to borrow 30 computers from the students and proposed to have a memorandum of
                   agreement with Bagtas Elementary School and Tanza National Trade School for borrowing of
                   additional computers.
                          Prof. Ramos opened the concern about the P5,000 being requested by the Department of
                   Information Technology for the installation of tiles in the computer laboratory and shared to the
                   group that he already asked Dr. Manuel about it and was told that the requested improvement is
                   not required. He then asked about update on the requested purchase of equipment and facilities
                   for accreditation. Ms. Sebastian reported that Dr. Polinga held over the purchase request because
                   the campus has no available space. Prof. Ramos then told the group that because there is lack of
                   support from the administration, the campus can document whatever is available in the campus
                   and use the result of evaluation as the basis of what to improve in the campus. After this, Ms.
                   Senaris shared the problem of the department about the lack of faculty member with master’s
                   degree and reported that she included Ms. Lewis from Trece Martires City Campus to the list of
                   faculty.
                          Prof. Ramos then shared that the donated lot for Tanza Campus was already presented
                   during the academic council meeting. He also shared to the group that he already requested to
                   the OVPAA that the campus will continue to hold online classes because of the lack of campus
                   facilities. Mr. Mark Sibulo then asked if there is already a target date of constructing the new]]></page><page Index="86"><![CDATA[campus  building.  Prof.  Ramos  answered  that  there  is  still  no  concrete  schedule  about  the
                   construction.
                          Mr. Banate then reported about their department’s preparation for COPC. He shared that
                   he is already finalizing the presentation and was able to borrow faculty from the main campus
                   resulting to 84% faculty members having master’s degree. He then told Prof. Ramos that Mr.
                   Mintu,  the  Brgy.  Bagtas  Chairperson,  is  asking  about  the  schedule  of  MOA  signing  with  the
                   University for the lot donated to Tanza campus. Prof. Ramos said that it is still on process of
                   approval.
                          Prof. Ramos then shared that the mock presentation of TED for COPC was postponed but
                   each department should continue their preparation. He also reminded the group to just present
                   what is available in the campus. He then asked for understanding for not being able to go to the
                   campus for health concerns and thanked the group for all their efforts.
                          After this, Ms. Banag presented the proposed streamlined designations.
                          Ms. Fabian then reminded the Contract of Service faculty members to submit authority to
                   go two days before the schedule because it needs to be submitted to different offices.
                          Prof. Ramos shared that the campus is not oblige to conduct a face-to-face class and to
                   be able to implement limited face-to-face, the campus must submit the necessary documents for
                   application  for  F2F  and  approval  from  the  LGU  is  also  necessary.  The  faculty  members  and
                   students must also be fully vaccinated and the students should have their parent’s consent.
                          Before the meeting ends, Ms. Addangna extended her gratitude to Ms. Sebastian, Mr.
                   Delgado, Ms. Fabian, and Mr. Mark Sibulo for being approachable.
                          The meeting adjourned at 12:15 PM.

         58        requested everyone to share any information regarding the meeting about the conduct of online

         60        announced that they were able to prepare the proposal for further endorsement and approval
         61        of the University Academic council to the Board of Regents.  It was reiterated that OJT shall
         62        be conducted online and the campus may accommodate OJT students in the campus but to
         63        ensure that the tasks are aligned to the program where the students are enrolled.
         64
         65               Ms. Mildred A. Sebastian mentioned that there will also be virtual student teaching
         66        internship for the coming first semester, but BSE students shall complete first the first two field
         67        studies  (EDFS  21  and  EDFS  22)  before  they  could  conduct  their  online  student  teaching
         68        internship.  EDFS 21 is offered during the current semester, and EDFS 22 will be offered during
         69        the Midyear Term.

         72        programs.  They were able to formulate the proposal and guidelines for the virtual OJT but like
         73        the  other  programs,  the  proposal  is  yet  to  be  approved  and  further  information  shall  be
         74        announced sooner or later, depending on the results of the approval of the proposal.  Working
         75        students whose nature of jobs are aligned with their program of course may seek for credit of
         76        their OJT as long as the competencies for a particular skill are achieved.  In addition, Ms.
         77        Elamparo mentioned that BSHM/BSTM students who wished to conduct the OJT shall pay a
         78        minimum amount of PhP4,000 to complete their virtual OJT.  Due to this, she made a poll with
         79        the BSHM students if ever they would pursue the virtual OJT and pay the necessary amount.
         80        Based on the results, most of the students signified their non-intention to pursue the virtual
         81        OJT due to financial constraints.
         82

         92        will be sending the memorandum from the CHED in the group chat of the campus, where each
         93        campus of the university shall be enjoined to attend and participate.
         94
         95               Prof. Ramos inquired about the preparation of the documents relative to the COPC
         96        application of the campus.  The College of Education, Office of the Graduate School, Naic
         97        Campus and Carmona Campus had already finished the virtual validation.  Prof. Sebastian
         98        mentioned that the preparation of the said documents is on-going. There have been some
         99        problems encountered as regards some supplies and materials relative to the preparation.
        100        Prof. Ramos pledged that the funds shall be available in terms of the campus cash advance.
        101        However, Ms. Noemi Perida mentioned that she encountered difficulties in canvassing some
        102        supplies and materials because there was a tight budget.  Prof. Sebastian made mentioned
        103        that  the  group  also  find  it  difficult  to  get  certified  copies  of  faculty  credentials  since  the
        104        University Records Office does not certify copies of TOR and diploma who are not graduates
        105        of the university.  Also, faculty members cannot be compelled to travel and get their TOR and
        106        diploma as certified true copy.
        107
        108               Prof. Ramos announced that the class observation shall push through as planned.  This
        109        will be from May 10 – 13, 2021.  This shall serve as one of the evaluation requirements for re-
        110        hiring of faculty members.
        111
        112               Prof. Ramos was happy to know that every permanent and temporary faculty members
        113        are enjoying their workload.  He also announced that the deadline of submission for the Unified]]></page><page Index="89"><![CDATA[114        Workload  System  will  be  June  10,  2021  and  no  more  extension  shall  be  given.    Faculty
        115        members who are entitled to workload credits are advised to submit their workload documents
        116        before June 10, 2021 to avoid non-inclusion in the evaluation.

         53               The meeting started at 3:00 PM with Prof. Gil D. Ramos as the presiding officer.  Before
         54        he officially discussed the main agenda of the meeting, he had some announcements for the
         55        group based on the administrative council meeting that was held the other day.  He announced
         56        that the campus water supply will be provided by the Office of the ABC President, Hon. SM]]></page><page Index="95"><![CDATA[57        Matro.  He also announced that the PhP4.5-million allotment for the two-storey building of
         58        CvSU Tanza Campus has been approved and that the group could expect its construction in
         59        the near future.  He further announced that the PhP50-million allotment for the 3-5 storey
         60        building of the campus has been approved.  The campus shall seek the assistance of the
         61        Bagtas LGU for any donation of land to realize this vision, especially when the campus shall
         62        be subjecting four of its programs under the CHED visit to obtain the Certificates of Program
         63        Compliance.
         64
         65               Another  concern  that  was  being  raised  during  the  Administrative  Council  was  the
         66        complaints through the 8888.  Most of Contract of Service (COS) Faculty members were filing
         67        concerns regarding the delay of salaries.  He sympathized with those faculty members but he
         68        mentioned that these faculty members must expedite all possible means to complete their
         69        requirements in order not to delay their salaries.
         70
         71               He  announced  that  each  faculty  member  shall  give  major  examinations,  such  as
         72        midterm and final exams in line with the school calendar.  However, faculty members shall
         73        have the leeway on when to give their midterm examination, depending on the lessons that
         74        were already discussed.
         75
         76               Prof. Ramos shared to the group that there was an alleged Diploma Factory in Tanza,
         77        being posted in the Facebook. This was discussed during the Administrative Council Meeting.
         78        He  requested  everyone  to  help  the  campus  in  tracking  down  the  source  or  production  of
         79        falsified documents.
         80
         81               He announced that there will be also class observation after the midterm examination.
         82        He requested everyone to submit their schedule of classes for the classroom observation.  This
         83        shall be the basis for re-hiring of faculty members for the next semester.
         84
         85               He  announced  that  the  Office  of  the  University  President  request  each  campus  to
         86        prepare  its  dashboard  of  information.    This  shall  include  all  primary  tools  and  general
         87        information about CvSU Tanza Campus.  He assigned the MIS officer and the four department
         88        chairpersons to take charge of this task.
         89
         90               The Socio-Cultural Development Coordinator presented the proposed Socio-Cultural
         91        Activities happening on May 17 – 21, 2021.  The activity is entitled CvSU Tanza Visual Culture

                   •  The school calendar for the school year 2022-2023 is being discussed:

                   •  The first day of classes is September 12, 2022.
                   •  The deadline for adding or changing subjects is September 30th.

                   •  The deadline for dropping subjects without an evaluation is October 7, 2022.
                   •  The  copies  of  the  students'  registration  certificates  (COR)  must  be  checked  by  all
                       instructors  for  each  course  because  there  are  students  who  are  not  formally

                       registered but are nevertheless attending classes.
                   •  Do not accept a student in your class if he or she does not have a copy of his or her

                       COR.
                   •  There is no need for a preliminary examination. It is up to the course instructor.

                   •  There will be a midterm exam. It is conducted either in person or online. It is entirely
                       up to the course instructor. However, make sure that a face-to-face midterm exam is
                       scheduled ahead of time.

                   •  The academic break is set to take place from November 14 to November 19, 2022.
                       Make certain that no assessments are given to students during the academic break
                       so that they can enjoy their time off.

                   •  The  final  examination  for  graduating  students  is  scheduled  from  January  16  to
                       January  21,  2023,  while  the  final  examination  for  non-graduating  students  is

                       scheduled from January 23 to January 28, 2023. It is conducted either in person or
                       online. It is entirely up to the course instructor. However, make sure that a face-to-
                       face midterm exam is scheduled ahead of time.

                   •  If  the  course  instructor's  final  examination  is  about  culminating  activities  such  as
                       demonstration teaching, it must be conducted face-to-face. However, make certain

                       that it is approved and scheduled ahead of time.
                   •  The deadline for submitting and uploading grades is February 7, 2023.

                   •  A  second  agenda  is  being  discussed.  It's  about  a  Teacher  Education  Department
                       activity  proposal.  In  addition,  ma'am  Jerry  Mae  and  ma'am  Woodelyn  have  been

          17   A. Villavicencio, IT Department Chair, Trece Martires City Campus.
          18
          19           The meeting started with an opening prayer led by Mr. Luke P. Ty, guidance coordinator of CvSU
          20   Trece Martires City Campus.

          30       Prof. Noel A. Sedigo, informed everyone to comply with the health protocols inside the campus
          31   strictly. The security guards were oriented to check every employee's temperature coming in and
          32   reminded them to use alcohol to sanitize their hands and of the visitors upon entering the campus
          33   premises. Likewise the so-called social distancing should be strictly imposed. Further, he emphasized
          34   that  each  campus  will  undergo  an  immediate  disinfection  with  the  help  of  the  campus  utility
          35   personnel.
          36
          37       Each faculty member is advised by Prof. Sedigo to prepare the course syllabus as early as now. He
          38   reminded all department chairs to give all faculty loads so that they can prepare course syllabi and
          39   modules, which is due on July 30, 2020. Mr. Luke Ty presented a lecture on how to design course
          40   syllabi and modules applicable in today's new normal environment. The approach is blended, online,
          41   and modular.
          42
          43       Prof.  Sedigo  suggested  to  the  faculty  to  be  clear  about  the  references.  References  must  be
          44   coordinated with the campus librarian for listing and acquisition of books. Ms. Villarante, the campus
          45   librarian, agreed and added that references, particularly electronic references, will be incorporated
          46   into the campus e-library.
          47
          48       Ms. Noemi Perida clarifies if possible to allow second-year students (HM and IT) to apply for
          49   graduation or  proceed  for  a  BS  degree. Prof.  Sedigo  responded  with, "yes  they  can."  He  further
          50   reminded everyone that T3 Campuses would not be having midyear classes for 2020. Ms. Feranail
          51   added that the students in the following semesters could take those subjects scheduled for midyear
          52   class 2020.

          55   given the subjects to be taught by each of the faculty members under their departments. Likewise,
          56   all other department chairs also assured that they already distributed subjects to the respective
          57   faculty members under their department.
          58
          59       Prof. Sedigo announced to submit requirements or faculty portfolios before the deadline to avoid
          60   the  salary  delay.  He  likewise  asked  why  most  of  Trece  Campus  faculty  members  have  not  yet
          61   submitted their grading sheets. Some answered that they still need to get their student files and
          62   records from the campus to do so.
          63
          64       Also, Prof. Sedigo reminded the department chairs and HR coordinators to finalize the number of
          65   faculty to be hired this First Semester AY 2020-2021 and in as much as possible consider those with
          66   masters’ degree and as well as doctors’ degree. This is in consideration for bolstering the faculty
          67   profile of the campuses and also for long term considerations.

          45   such  as  face  masks,  alcohol,  temperature  scanner,  etc.  Further,  Prof.  Sedigo  requested  that

          49       Prof. Sedigo asked Prof. Feranil about the status of the Workload and Teaching. Prof. Feranil said
          50   that she already distributed the loads to the respective department chairs; however, none of the
          51   department chairs submitted the accomplished load assignments.

          62   can be used systemwide.
          63
          64   REALIGNMENT OF BUDGET
          65       Prof. Sedigo instructed the Budget Officers to realign the budget, such as the budget for seminars,
          66   trainings, conferences, accreditation, to budget for equipment and other things necessary for the new
          67   normal classes.
          68
          69   GRADES AND TEACHING PORTFOLIO
          70       Prof. Sedigo reminded all to submit the grades and teaching portfolio on time to avoid delay on

          79   compliance of the mentioned health protocols. Ms. Lontoc responded and she said that she will do it
          80   immediately.
          81

          26   T3 ALTERNATIVE WORK ARRANGEMENT
          27
          28       Prof. Noel A. Sedigo, the campus administrator, said that T3 campuses would create a skeletal
          29   workforce  who  will  report  to  their  respective  campuses  as  soon  as  the  Enhanced  Community
          30   Quarantine  is  lifted.  Included  in  the  skeletal  workforce  are  the  regular  faculty  members  with
          31   designations and all the non- teaching personnel. On the other hand, all faculty members with a
          32   service status contract will be working from home.
          33
          34      Dr. Jessie Anne T. Demetillo agreed that she would prepare the proposed skeletal workforce with
          35   Alternative Work Assignments for submission and approval of the Office of the Vice President for
          36   Academic Affairs and Office of the President.
          37
          38      Prof. Sedigo also advised the faculty and staff that the end of the semester on April 30, 2020, was
          39   already approved. However, faculty members on the contract of service status will still be on service
          40   and be receiving their salaries until June 14, 2020.
          41
          42
          43      Prof. Sedigo advised the faculty that grades for the Second  Semester, AY 2019-2020, will only be
          44   SATISFACTORY, NO GRADE OR DROPPED.
          45
          46      Prof. Cristza de Ocampo asked about the grades that will be given to the OJT student who has not
          47   started their second phase of the OJT practicum.
          48
          49      Prof. Sedigo answered that in as long as the student had started their first phase OJT program and
          50   had their MOA or MOU, it is acceptable to give a grade of SATISFACTORY. For OJT, EDP, and Thesis
          51   requirements, only  a  narrative  report will  be  submitted  by  the  students  as  compliance  with  the
          52   requirement.
          53
          54      Mr. Comiso asked Prof. Sedigo if the submission of grades and portfolio is online.]]></page><page Index="139"><![CDATA[55

          59   will also be submitted online.
          60
          61      Prof. Sedigo also responded with a Yes.
          62
          63      Prof. Sedigo consulted, and the body agreed to have no mid-year classes for the T3 campuses this
          64   2020. He said that First Semester AY 2020 would start in August, and thus faculty members without
          65   designation will be reporting only in August 2020. Further, he confirmed that there is still a graduation
          66   plan, and it will right after when the COVID is over.
          67
          68      All faculty members are required to submit the teaching portfolio containing the following to their
          69   respective department chairs to avoid delay of salary: grading sheet, class record, attendance sheet,
          70   teaching materials, supplemental materials, etc. The deadline for submission is on June 11, 2020.

          51]]></page><page Index="142"><![CDATA[52       Ms. Arlene Estrada reminded all that the schedule for AACCUP accreditation would be in August

          58
          59       Prof. Sedigo requested Prof. Feranil (Trece Campus), Prof. Sebastian (Tanza Campus) and Dr.
          60   Manarpiis (Gentri Campus) to prepare the IMDU Committee Campus immediately to be submitted to
          61   the Office of the University President for approval. And, they all agreed with Prof. Sedigo.
          62
          63       As  to  midterm  examination,  Prof.  Sedigo  reminded  all  faculty  to  prepare  and  submit  their
          64   midterm examinations with TOS to their respective Department Chairs at least two weeks before the
          65   scheduled exam for review and approval before reproduction.
          66
          67       The University Games and as well as Foundation Day are yet to be rescheduled per campus.
          68   However,  for T3 campuses,  it  was agreed  to  have a  temporary  schedule  for the  foundation  day
          69   celebrations and solidarity programs as follows: Trece: May 6, 2020; Tanza: May 7, 2020, and Gentri:
          70   May 8, 2020.
          71
          72       Prof. Noel A. Sedigo calls the attention of Ms. Mary Ann L. Anonas, T3 registrar, and the rest of
          73   the registrar aid to do the counterchecking of the Master List to ensure correct billing as to the
          74   number of the enrolled students. Ms. Anonas said she had already done the counterchecking of the
          75   master  list.  She  even  visited  the  Gen.  Trias  City  campus  to  ensure  the  records'  accuracy  to  be
          76   submitted at the main campus. Likewise, all OSAS Head and CSG advisers are requested to process
          77   the students' insurance as soon as possible.
          78
          79       Prof. Sedigo also reminded the permanent, temporary, and casual faculty and staff to submit PDS
          80   and SALN to the HR Coordinator to be submitted on or before March 16, 2020, at the main campus.
          81
          82       As per Prof. Sedigo, Flexi-time is still up, and the use of biometrics is always encouraged. He
          83   requested Dr. Demetillo to prepare a letter to ask the qualified T3 personnel to allow Flexi-time
          84   because of the other designations they have. Prof. Sedigo also informed Ms. Hosmillo to request a
          85   new biometric for Trece Campus since it is no longer working.
          86
          87       Mr. Laynes reiterated  that Gentri Campus  could hardly impose  the solid waste management
          88   program since they are occupying three locations. The guards could barely monitor the students'
          89   activities in disposing of their garbage.
          90       Prof. Sedigo reminds Ms. Manlapig to remind the canteen owners about garbage disposal and
          91   Ms. Lontoc, Mr. Cajigas, and Mr. Laynes to monitor solid waste management for each campus.
          92
          93       Mr. Cajigas requested for a truck and driver to pick up the chairs in Las Pinas donated by the
          94   concerned foundation. Prof. Sedigo asked John to coordinated the said request to the main campus.
          95
          96   No further matter was discussed.
          97

                He discussed the topics well. He also assessed the students' understanding of the topic by asking
                questions during the discussion. It is then suggested to  think of other ways to make the class
                interactive and encourage student participation. Thought the topic (Propaganda Movement) is in
                the syllabus, make sure that it falls within the intended learning outcomes of the course to ensure
                that everyone will achieve what is intended to be achieved.

               Comments/Remarks
               The class discussion is very lively.  She uses reporting as a method, however, it is very effective.
               While the teacher prepared the presentation, the reporters are expected to explain in details what
               they are assigned. Hence, each and every reporter must be well-prepared since only the topic are
               given.

                   3.  Other suggestions for improvement
                       Ms. Ampon may consider asking for more questions from students to ensure that
               ______________________________________________________________________
               they well-understood the lesson. Also, she needs to prepare more engaging activities for

               ______________________________________________________________________
               the students to deviate from lecture-discussion.

                   3.  Other suggestions for improvement
                       Ms. Mojica may consider asking for more questions from students to ensure that
               ______________________________________________________________________
               they well-understood the lesson. Also, she needs to prepare more engaging activities for
               ______________________________________________________________________
               ______________________________________________________________________
               the students to deviate from lecture-discussion.

                   3.  Other suggestions for improvement
                       Ms. Tagle may consider asking for more questions from students to ensure that
               ______________________________________________________________________
               they well-understood the lesson. Also, she needs to prepare more engaging activities for
               ______________________________________________________________________
               ______________________________________________________________________
               the students to deviate from lecture-discussion.

               II.  Suggestions for Improvement
                   1.  The course should:

                   1.   Think of another way to let his students participate in the discussion.
                   2.   Instead of you discussing the whole time, why not call someone to share his/her own
                        understanding of the topic. This way, you can also clarify whether your students have a
                        clear understanding of the topic.
                   3.   Consider asking for more questions from students to ensure that they well-understood
                        the lesson.
                   4.   Please try to think of ways to ensure that learning targets are achieved in long-term
                        period.
                   5.   Consider improving questioning skills, focusing on higher-order thinking among
                        students.
                   6.   She needs to prepare more engaging activities for the students to deviate from lecture-
                        discussion.
                   7.   Please allow your students to participate in the discussion, not just by listening to what
                        you say, but by asking them their thoughts and opinions.
                   8.   Ask the student if he is still audible and camera is working as these are the
                        things that need to be checked all the time.
                   9.   Summarize major points before ending the class to check student
                        understanding.
                   10.  Varies voice to maintain student interest.
                   11.  Try to facilitate more rather than pure discussions to let the students discover
                        new learnings on their own.
                   12.  Establish rapport with the students and prepare more engaging activities.
                   13.  Try to relate the course to contemporary issues.
