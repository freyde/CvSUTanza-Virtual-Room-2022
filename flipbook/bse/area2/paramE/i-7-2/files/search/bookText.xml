                   Section 7. Basic Requirements of Scholarship

                          Scholars should enroll the required regular load during the semestral
                   or summer classes. Regular load means twelve (12) units per semester, nine
                   (9) units per trimester and quarterm, and six (6) units of academic subjects
                   during summer. A load of nine (9) units may be allowed during the initial
                   semester  or  six  (6)  units  during  the  initial  trimester  or  quarterm  of
                   coursework upon prior approval of the Scholarship Committee. The scholars
                   should coordinate with the FSDO before finalizing their coursework in order
                   to ensure that the load requirement is satisfied.

                          In case the intended course to be enrolled is dissolved or has reached
                   the quota for the required number of enrollees and no substitute course is
                   allowed by the graduate committee, the scholar’s stipend will be pro-rated
                   based  on  his  load  during  the  semester/trimester.  The  scholar  will  be
                   required to reinstate if he does not have any subject to enroll for reasons
                   stated above.

                   Section 8. Change of Specialization

                           The selection of scholars is based on specific fields of specialization.
                   The scholars cannot change their field of specialization or major course of
                   work without prior authorization from the University. A change in the field
                   of  study/specialization  and  school  shall  not  be  allowed  specially  if  it
                   requires additional period of scholarship and additional expense on part of
                   the University except in certain meritorious cases beyond their control. The

                          performance is rated “ Very Satisfactory”.

                          A  faculty  member  shall  automatically  be  on  vacation  leave  with  pay
                          during the school vacations, unless he expressly opts to teach and his

                          to an honorarium and/ or service credits in addition to his vacation
                          pay.

                                 In addition to the foregoing vacation and sick leaves with pay as
                          provided for in articles relative thereto above, faculty members shall

                            engaged  in  such  work  as  research  or  other  assignments  which
                            involve work beyond their normal work load and which prevent them
                            from  taking  advantage  of  the  teacher’s  vacation  leave,  both
                            conditions  being  certified  by  the  Unit  Head  may  enjoy  cumulative

                            University  for  at  least  one  academic  year.  Faculty  members  given
