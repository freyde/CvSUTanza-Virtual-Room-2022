Basic Requirements of Scholarship                            Scholars should enroll the required regular load during the semestral                    or summer classes. Regular load means twelve (12) units per semester, nine                    (9) units per trimester and quarterm, and six (6) units of academic subjects                    during summer. A load of nine (9) units may be allowed during the initial                    semester  or  six  (6)  units  during  the  initial  trimester  or  quarterm  of                    coursework upon prior approval of the Scholarship Committee. The scholars                    should coordinate with the FSDO before finalizing their coursework in order                    to ensure that the load requirement is satisfied.                            In case the intended course to be enrolled is dissolved or has reached                    the quota for the required number of enrollees and no substitute course is                    allowed by the graduate committee, the scholar’s stipend will be pro-rated                    based  on  his  load  during  the  semester/trimester.  The  scholar  will  be                    required to reinstate if he does not have any subject to enroll for reasons                    stated above.                     Section 8. Change of Specialization                             The selection of scholars is based on specific fields of specialization.                    The scholars cannot change their field of specialization or major course of                    work without prior authorization from the University. A change in the field                    of  study/specialization  and  school  shall  not  be  allowed  specially  if  it                    requires additional period of scholarship and additional expense on part of                    the University except in certain meritorious cases beyond their control.
