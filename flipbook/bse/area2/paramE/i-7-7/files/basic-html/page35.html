            METHODOLOGY


               A descriptive-correlational design was employed in this study. Three independent variables namely, achievement motivation,
            locus of control and study habits were used to determine whether they were predictors of mathematics achievement of college
            students taking non-board examination programs. A total of 258 students who were enrolled in Bachelor of Science in Tourism
            Management, Bachelor of Science in Hospitality Management and Bachelor of Science in Business Management, all of which are
            non-board examination programs were purposively selected to participate in the study. The participants were enrolled in the
            course mathematics in the Modern World during the first semester of the academic year 2019-2020 at a certain state university in
            Southern Luzon, Philippines.
               The researcher used four (4) research instruments in collecting data for the study. First, the researcher used the mathematics
            Achievement  Motivation  Scale  to  measure  the  achievement  motivation  of  the  students.  It  was  adapted  from  Achievement
            Motivation Scale by Prathibha Deo and Asha Mohan (2002) originally with a total item of 50. Some of the items were modified to
            suit the student’s achievement motivation in mathematics and 7 items were removed because they are not related to the study.
            The questionnaire used in this study consisted of 42 items covering description of the items such as academic motivation, need
            for achievement, academic challenge, achievement anxiety, importance of grades, meaningfulness of task, relevance of college
            to future goals, attitude towards education, work methods, attitude towards teachers, interpersonal relations, individual concern
            and general interests. The scale was validated by three experts in the fields of education and psychology. After validation, it was
            pilot-tested among 35 students who were not part of the population under study. It has a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.784 which is
            greater than the minimum acceptable requirement of 0.70 (George & Mallery, 2003).
               The second instrument is the Locus of Control Scale, which was used to measure the locus of control of the students. This was
            adapted from Ashton D. Trice’s Revised Academic Locus of Control Scale (2013). Some items were modified to fit the student’s
            locus of control in mathematics. The questionnaires consisted of 21 items and each item consisted of true or false responses. It
            was also pilot-tested to another group of 35 students who were not part of the population under study. The computed Cronbach’s
            alpha for the data gathered is 0.725.
               The third instrument, the mathematics Study Habits Inventory, was used to measure the study habits of the students. It was
            adapted from Study Habits Inventory by M. N. Palsane and Sadhna Sharma (1989), which was originally a 45-item test. There were
            items on study habits that were modified and others were removed because the questions were not related to the study. The final
            instrument consisted of 37 items which measured the students’ study habits in terms of time management, physical status, study
            aids/note taking, motivation, testing strategies, reading ability, memory, and health and was validated by three experts in the field
            of education and psychology. It was also pilot-tested to another set of 35 students who were not part of the population under
            study. The computed Cronbach’s alpha for the data is 0.705.
               Finally, a teacher-made test was constructed to determine the mathematics achievement of the students and was validated
            by three experts. This consisted of 40-item multiple choice type test. The coverage of the exam included topics based on the
            mathematics in the Modern World taken by the students. The topics included Patterns and Numbers in Nature, Mathematical
            Languages and Symbols, Problem Solving and Reasoning and Data Management.
               Permit to conduct the study was first secured from the Office of the Administrator of the state university. After gathering the
            total number of first year students enrolled in non-board courses, the researcher proceeded to the distribution of the four different
            questionnaires. The researcher was accompanied by a psychometrician in administering the tests for two consecutive days except
            for mathematics Achievement Test.

            RESULTS


            Student’s Profile
               Majority of the students have average achievement motivation, internal locus of control, desirable study habits and average
            mathematics achievement. The results are presented in Table 1.
               The average achievement motivation of the freshman students obtained was similar to the result of the studies conducted by
            Chetri  (2014),  Sarangi  (2015),  Roy  (2015)  and  Rani  and  Reddy (2019).  It  indicates  that  with  little  guidance  from  the  teacher,</code></pre>
