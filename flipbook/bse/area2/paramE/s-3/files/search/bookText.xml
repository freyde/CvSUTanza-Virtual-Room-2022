                   Section 7. Basic Requirements of Scholarship

                          Scholars should enroll the required regular load during the semestral
                   or summer classes. Regular load means twelve (12) units per semester, nine
                   (9) units per trimester and quarterm, and six (6) units of academic subjects
                   during summer. A load of nine (9) units may be allowed during the initial
                   semester  or  six  (6)  units  during  the  initial  trimester  or  quarterm  of
                   coursework upon prior approval of the Scholarship Committee. The scholars
                   should coordinate with the FSDO before finalizing their coursework in order
                   to ensure that the load requirement is satisfied.

                          In case the intended course to be enrolled is dissolved or has reached
                   the quota for the required number of enrollees and no substitute course is
                   allowed by the graduate committee, the scholar’s stipend will be pro-rated
                   based  on  his  load  during  the  semester/trimester.  The  scholar  will  be
                   required to reinstate if he does not have any subject to enroll for reasons
                   stated above.

                   Section 8. Change of Specialization

                           The selection of scholars is based on specific fields of specialization.
                   The scholars cannot change their field of specialization or major course of
                   work without prior authorization from the University. A change in the field
                   of  study/specialization  and  school  shall  not  be  allowed  specially  if  it
                   requires additional period of scholarship and additional expense on part of
                   the University except in certain meritorious cases beyond their control. The
                                                                                                           98

                          evaluation system is designed to:

                       a)  Continuously  foster  improvement  of  employee’s  performance  and
                          efficiency;

                       b)  Enhance organizational effectiveness and productivity;

                       c)  Provide an objective performance rating which shall serve as a basis
                          for  incentive  and  rewards,  promotion,  training  and  development,

                       d)  Provide  for  the  identification  of  outputs  and  job-related  behavior  as
                          well as corresponding performance measures which shall be mutually
                          agreed  upon  between  supervisors  and  subordinates  for  a  particular
                          appraisal period. The performance of the employee shall be evaluated
                          on the basis of his accomplishment as against his performance target;

                       e)  Provide  opportunity  for  supervisors  to  make  comments  and
                          recommendations  regarding  employee’s  strengths  and  weaknesses
                          which  maybe  instrumental  in  furthering  his  career,  or  identifying
                          factors  that  may  impede  his  development.  Comments  from

                          and shall be given due weight in making personnel decisions; and

                       f)  Provide  sanctions  against  raters  who  use  the  performance  rating  to
                          give undue advantage and disadvantage to people they rate.



                                                                                                           127

                          evaluated with the use of prescribed forms (ANNEX D2) twice a year:

                       a)  Outstanding – an employee of the University shall be given this rating
                          when he exceeds his targets by at least 30 percent. It represents an
                          extraordinary  level  of  achievement  and  commitment  in  terms  of
                          quality and time, technical knowledge and skill, ingenuity, creativity
                          and  initiative.  Employee  at  this  performance  level  should  have
                          demonstrated  exceptional  job  mastery  in  all  major  aspects  of
                          responsibility. His achievement and contributions to the organization
                          are of marked excellence which his peers and supervisors recognize.

                       b)  Very Satisfactory – An employee of the University shall be given this
                          rating when he exceeds the expected output/performance by at least
                          15-29  percent  but  falls  short  of  what  is  considered  an  outstanding
                          performance.

                                 Only  employees  with  Outstanding  and  Very  Satisfactory
                          Performance  Ratings  for  two  consecutive  rating  periods  shall  be
                          considered for promotion.

                       c)  Satisfactory – An employee of the University shall be given this rating
                          when he meets the standards or ordinary requirements of the duties
                          of  the  position  or  his  performance  is  100  to  114  percent  of  the
                          planned targets.

                       d)  Unsatisfactory  –  An  employee  of  the  University  shall  be  given  this
                          rating when his performance falls short of the minimum requirements
                          but could stand improvement, or if performance is 51 to 99 percent of
                          the target. It is expected that in the next rating period, the employee
                          under close supervision, will either improve his performance for which
                          he  shall  be  given  a  satisfactory  rating.  Two  (2)  successive
                          Unsatisfactory  Ratings  shall  be  a  ground  for  separation  from  the
                          service.

                       e)  Poor – An employee of the University shall be given this rating when
                          he fails to meet performance requirements by 50 percent or below. A
                          “Poor” Performance Rating shall be a ground for separation from the
                          service.


                                                                                                           128
