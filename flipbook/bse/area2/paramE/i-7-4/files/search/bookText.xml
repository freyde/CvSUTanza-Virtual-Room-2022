               Dear Prof. Sedigo:

               I am grateful for the many opportunities you have provided me since I became part of the
               institution for eleven years now. As member of the academe, I acknowledge the importance
               of  continuing  education  in  pursuit  for  excellence  especially  in  the  area  of  instruction  and
               research as two of my core functions as academician. In this regard, I am currently pursuing
               my PhD in Mathematics Education at the Philippine Normal University. I am currently enrolled
               in my dissertation writing (DW1) and defended my concept paper for this purpose.

               In line with this, I would like to request your good office to allow me to handle just 12 units in
               instruction this First Semester AY 2019-2020 for me to devote more time in my Dissertation
               proposal defense which I planned to present before the Second Semester of AY 2019-2020
               and hopefully could conduct the data gathering part immediately after so that I could finish my
               degree within the prescribed time.

               I am hoping that this request grants your favorable approval.

               Thank you very much.

               Very truly yours,
