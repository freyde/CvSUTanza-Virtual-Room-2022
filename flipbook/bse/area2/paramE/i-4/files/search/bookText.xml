                   Section 7. Basic Requirements of Scholarship

                          Scholars should enroll the required regular load during the semestral
                   or summer classes. Regular load means twelve (12) units per semester, nine
                   (9) units per trimester and quarterm, and six (6) units of academic subjects
                   during summer. A load of nine (9) units may be allowed during the initial
                   semester  or  six  (6)  units  during  the  initial  trimester  or  quarterm  of
                   coursework upon prior approval of the Scholarship Committee. The scholars
                   should coordinate with the FSDO before finalizing their coursework in order
                   to ensure that the load requirement is satisfied.

                          In case the intended course to be enrolled is dissolved or has reached
                   the quota for the required number of enrollees and no substitute course is
                   allowed by the graduate committee, the scholar’s stipend will be pro-rated
                   based  on  his  load  during  the  semester/trimester.  The  scholar  will  be
                   required to reinstate if he does not have any subject to enroll for reasons
                   stated above.

                   Section 8. Change of Specialization

                           The selection of scholars is based on specific fields of specialization.
                   The scholars cannot change their field of specialization or major course of
                   work without prior authorization from the University. A change in the field
                   of  study/specialization  and  school  shall  not  be  allowed  specially  if  it
                   requires additional period of scholarship and additional expense on part of
                   the University except in certain meritorious cases beyond their control. The
                                                                                                           98]]></page><page Index="8"><![CDATA[CvSU MANUAL OF OPERATIONS
                   ______________________________________________________________________
                                                                                                         99

                   unit  heads/deans  should  justify  that  the  change  would  benefit  their
                   unit/college in particular and the University in general. If a faculty member
                   pursued  a  program  authorized  by  the  University  but  which  is  not  in  line
                   with his field of specialization or not needed by his college/unit, he will be
                   required  to  transfer  to  another  college/unit  within  the  University  System
                   that needs such field of study/specialization.

                           A  scholar  who  changes  his  field  of  specialization  without  prior
                   approval  will  be  required  to  reinstate  and  refund  in  full  all  expenses
                   incurred during his scholarship to include tuition and other fees, stipend,
                   book allowance, thesis allowance, salary and other financial incentives.


                   Section 9. Leave of Absence

                          A total maximum leave of absence equivalent to one school year may
                   be granted to the faculty member or staff on scholarship upon prior request
                   based on meritorious reasons subject to the submission of an approved LOA
                   from  the  graduate  school  and  approval  of  the  University  President  upon
                   recommendation of the Scholarship Committee. The scholar on LOA shall be
                   required  to  reinstate  to  the  University  and  shall  not  be  entitled  to
                   allowances  of  a  scholar.  The  period  of  reinstatement  is  good  only  for  the
                   length  of  the  approved  LOA  unless  otherwise  approved  by  higher
                   authorities.

                   Section10. Length of Study

                          Faculty members and staff on scholarship are allowed a maximum of
                   two  (2)  years  to  finish  their  MA/MS/MBA/related  degrees  and  three  (3)
                   years to finish their Ph.D./DBA/related degrees excluding the period of their
                   approved LOA.


                   Section 11. Extension of Scholarship

                          Extension  of  scholarship  beyond  the  period  specified  in  Section  10
                   may be allowed only for five (5) months with full privileges upon certification
                   of the Adviser that the scholar can finish the course within the extension
                   period  and  the  Scholarship  Committee  has  determined  that  normal  credit
                   loads have been taken every semester. An additional extension for less than
                   or  maximum  of  five  (5)  months  only  on  official  time  and  without  stipend
                   could  be  granted  for  meritorious  reasons  and  certification  of  the  adviser
                   and/or dean of the graduate school.



                                                                                                           99]]></page><page Index="9"><![CDATA[CvSU MANUAL OF OPERATIONS

                          In case of  completion of thesis or dissertation beyond the allowable
                   scholarship period, (3 years for MS/MA/MBA and 4 years for Ph.D./DBA),
                   the grantee shall be required to reinstate to the University while completing
                   the thesis/dissertation requirements and is no longer entitled to scholarship
                   privileges.

                   Section 12. Completion of Degree

                           A scholar, upon completion of degree, should submit within three (3)
                   months an article for publication in the University Research Journal based
                   on his study and bound copies of his thesis or dissertation to the University
                   Library, FSDO, Research Center and Quality Assurance and Accreditation
                   Center. Further, a scholar should present a paper to the local Agency In-
                   House  Review  or  other  venues  as  may  be  coordinated  by  the  Research
                   Center.

                   Section 13. Obligations of Scholars

                          The scholar, before commencing studies, should agree to the following
                   terms and conditions:

                          a.  To  conduct  himself  in  a  manner  so  as  not  to  bring  disgrace  or
                              dishonor to the University and to the country;

                          b.  Any  misconduct  such  as  immorality,  assault  on  authority,
                              excessive  drunkenness,  inciting  rebellion  or  sedition  or  a
                              combination of the same, and acts not in conformity with the Code
                              of Conduct for Government Employees (RA 6713) are grounds for
                              immediate  termination  of  scholarship,  pending  investigation  and
                              subsequent  legal  proceedings  against  the  scholar  in  accordance
                              with Civil Service and other government rules and regulations;

                          c.  To keep up with the high standards of scholarship;

                                     The  grantee  should  understand  that  scholarship  is  both  a
                              privilege and a responsibility. It is the responsibility of a scholar to
                              behave  as  a  responsible  scholar  at  all  times.  He  is  therefore
                              required  to  maintain  a  grade  point  average  of  2.00  for  graduate
                              courses  (or  their  equivalent  requirements)  at  the  end  of  every
                              semester. A GPA below these requirements shall automatically lose
                              his scholarship slot. Fees paid for courses with INC. which are not
                              completed  /  graded  within  the  allowed  period  of  completion,
                              should  be  refunded  and  the  pro-rated  amount  of  stipend  for  the
                              said period would be deducted from the succeeding stipends.

                          d.  To submit the following to the FSDO;
                                                                                                           100]]></page><page Index="10"><![CDATA[CvSU MANUAL OF OPERATIONS

                   at least three (3) months is normally discouraged unless this is a matter of
                   urgency in so far as operations and/or establishments of new university are
                   concerned.

                          Attendance  to  short  courses  overseas  is  encouraged  to  broaden  the
                   experience of the candidates. Unless initiated by the individual faculty/staff
                   member,  NEDA,  CHED  and  other  foreign  institutional  agencies  normally
                   coordinate  with  the  University  on  available  training  course/fellowship
                   overseas and the faculty or staff recommended by the University competes
                   with  the  applicants  from  other  Colleges.  The  same  rules,  guidelines  and
                   obligations are followed for the overseas non-degree scholarship program.
