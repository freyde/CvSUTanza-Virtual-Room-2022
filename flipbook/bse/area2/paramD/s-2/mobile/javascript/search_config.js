Policies and Guidelines on Administrative Matters                                  a)      Conduct of Official Business                                           Travels.  When  faculty  members  deem  it  necessary  to                                          travel  domestically  or  internationally  for  research                                          purposes,  observation  or  study,  the  President,  in  his                                          discretion,  may  authorize  the  college  to  allot  from  its                                          appropriation  for  Traveling  Expenses  of  Personnel,  such                                          amount as may be necessary for travel. Faculty members                                          should inform the President in writing the details at least                                          two  weeks  before  the  planned  travel  to  obtain  the                                          approval and confirmation of support from the University.                                                 Travels may be official, religious, social or personal                                          in nature contingent on the needs of the service; hence,                                          approval for authority to travel is needed when a faculty                                          represents University functions, as the trip is sponsored                                          by the University or a sponsoring inviting agency.                                           Field  Trips.  Faculty  members  are  encouraged  to  plan                                          field trips for ocular or on-the-spot education of students.                                          It is expected that these field trips be carefully correlated                                          with  the  subject  matter  of  the  course.
