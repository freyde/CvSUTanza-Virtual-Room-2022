                       University.  Within  this  specific  framework,  the  following  principles  are
                       hereby declared:

                              undertaken on his own initiative.

                          c)  Furthermore,  the  University  shall  recognize  that  the  teacher,  in
                              speaking or writing outside of the University upon subjects beyond
                              the scope of his own field of study, is entitled to the same freedom

                          based on the vacated field of specialization; and (2) faculty members

                          studies.

                          following:  (1)  existing  unfilled-up  vacant  positions;  (2)  result  of
                          collapsing  existing  vacant  items;  (3)  created  internally  based  on

                                         Travels.  When  faculty  members  deem  it  necessary  to
                                         travel  domestically  or  internationally  for  research
                                         purposes,  observation  or  study,  the  President,  in  his
                                         discretion,  may  authorize  the  college  to  allot  from  its
                                         appropriation  for  Traveling  Expenses  of  Personnel,  such
                                         amount as may be necessary for travel. Faculty members
                                         should inform the President in writing the details at least
                                         two  weeks  before  the  planned  travel  to  obtain  the
                                         approval and confirmation of support from the University.
                                                Travels may be official, religious, social or personal
                                         in nature contingent on the needs of the service; hence,
                                         approval for authority to travel is needed when a faculty
                                         represents University functions, as the trip is sponsored
                                         by the University or a sponsoring inviting agency.

                                         Field  Trips.  Faculty  members  are  encouraged  to  plan
                                         field trips for ocular or on-the-spot education of students.
                                         It is expected that these field trips be carefully correlated
                                         with  the  subject  matter  of  the  course.  Before  finalizing

                   Section 8.  Permanent Appointment.                A  permanent  appointment  upon

                   policies and guidelines on the recruitment and appointment of faculty and
                   academic staff as established in this Merit System.

                   Section 11.  Career Advancement

                       a)  Policies

                          •  The primary basis for  promotion shall be the established policies
                              under CSC Res. No. 83-343, in as far as they are consistent with
                              the guidelines prescribed by CSC No. 5, s. 1987 and CSC Res. No.
                              84-105  A  dated  29  March  1984  and  supplemented  by  NBC  No.
                              461.

                          •  In  case  where  the  competence  and  qualification  of  two  or  more
                              faculty  or  academic  staff  are  comparatively  at  par,  preferences
                              shall  be  given  the  candidate  already  working  in  the  department
                              where the vacancy exists.

                          •  Corollary  to  Section  5  above,  the  University  adopts  the  policy  of
                              giving preference to insiders whose qualifications and competence
                              are  determined  to  be  at  par  with  applicants  from  outside  the
                              University.

                          •  The mere filing of an administrative charge shall not constitute a
                              disqualification  for  promotion.  When  an  employee  who  is
                              legitimately entitled to promotion is administratively charged, the

                                                                                                           126]]></page><page Index="18"><![CDATA[CvSU MANUAL OF OPERATIONS

                              position to which he should have been promoted shall not be filled
                              until after the case shall have been finally decided. However, when
                              the  exigency  of  the  service  requires  immediate  filling-up  of  the
                              position/rank, then it shall be filled by a substitute appointment
                              until  the  administrative  case  against  the  employee  is  finally
                              decided. Should the employee who is administratively charged be
                              exonerated,  he  shall  be  promoted  to  the  rank  he  is  qualified  for
                              promotion.

                          •  A  faculty/  academic  staff  who  feels  aggrieved  on  the  decision  on
                              promotion may file a protest within 15 days after the decision on
                              promotion has been made in accordance with pertinent civil service
                              rules.

                   Section 12.  Performance  Evaluation  System.  Pursuant  to  CSC  MC  No.
                          13,  s.  1999,  the  University  shall  adopt  its  own  performance
                          evaluation   system       for   all   its    personnel.     This    performance
                          evaluation system is designed to:

                       a)  Continuously  foster  improvement  of  employee’s  performance  and
                          efficiency;

                       b)  Enhance organizational effectiveness and productivity;

                       c)  Provide an objective performance rating which shall serve as a basis
                          for  incentive  and  rewards,  promotion,  training  and  development,
                          personnel sanctions and administrative sanctions;

                       d)  Provide  for  the  identification  of  outputs  and  job-related  behavior  as
                          well as corresponding performance measures which shall be mutually
                          agreed  upon  between  supervisors  and  subordinates  for  a  particular
                          appraisal period. The performance of the employee shall be evaluated
                          on the basis of his accomplishment as against his performance target;

                       e)  Provide  opportunity  for  supervisors  to  make  comments  and
                          recommendations  regarding  employee’s  strengths  and  weaknesses
                          which  maybe  instrumental  in  furthering  his  career,  or  identifying
                          factors  that  may  impede  his  development.  Comments  from
                          supervisors are expected to facilitate the employee’s personal growth
                          and shall be given due weight in making personnel decisions; and

                       f)  Provide  sanctions  against  raters  who  use  the  performance  rating  to
                          give undue advantage and disadvantage to people they rate.
