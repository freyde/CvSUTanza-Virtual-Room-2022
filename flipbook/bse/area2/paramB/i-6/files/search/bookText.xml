                        The program started with a summary topic such as CvSU - Tanza at Glance,

                  introduction to key officials and support personnel, gender and development in
                  the workplace and campus extension services. It was followed by discussing the

                  test construction, Table of Specifications (TOS), rubrics preparation and other

                        Meanwhile, Prof. Mildred A. Sebastian, chairperson of the department of
                  education, discussed the content of course syllabus and module preparation.


                        Furthermore, Ms. Charmaine T. Banag, faculty member under information
                  technology, oriented all faculty members about the CvSU Learning Management

                  System (LMS), its procedure, and imperative feature. Besides, a short tutorial

                  was presented to broaden the knowledge of all participants.

                  teaching personnel and to inform them about the upcoming school year 2022-
