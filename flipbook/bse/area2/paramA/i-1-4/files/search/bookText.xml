                                                           PREFACE



                              College and Advanced Algebra as a course builds upon the students’ knowledge
                       on  properties  of  the  real  number  system,  operations  on  different  types  of  algebraic
                       expressions, and the solution of various types of equations and inequalities. The course
                       also covers the prerequisites to trigonometry and calculus, specifically transcendental and
                       non-transcendental  functions,  including  the  characteristics  of  their  graphs  and
                       applications.

                              This text has the following features:

                              What will you learn? is the component that specifies the skills to be developed
                       and serve as a guide for the learners to remain focused on the content of the instruction.
                       This is written along with the introduction of the chapter, What is the module about?.

                              What to do? elaborates on the tasks and/or activities that enable the learners to
                       comprehend  and  follow  the  procedures  for  effective  computational  fluency.  This
                       component  also  engages  learners  to  investigate  numerical  aspects  of  real  world
                       experiences that can develop their creative and critical thinking skills. These skills  can
                       enhance their problem solving capabilities, make connections for meaningful  learning,
                       communicate and demonstrate understanding of concepts and skills, and develop values
                       of perseverance, hard work, cooperation, and the like in doing learning tasks alone or with
                       others.
                              Self-Check is an activity which helps learners to master the basic concepts, skills,

                       and processes.

                              What have you learned? is the summary of the lessons provided at the end of
                       each chapter which summarizes ideas resulting from exploration activities.

                              It is the ultimate goal of the author to provide learners the opportunity to express
                       in writing their thoughts and feelings about their learning experiences and become aware
                       of their own mathematical thinking.
                              Solutions and some illustrations to the examples are given in such a way that it
                       can be easily understood by the students. These are also the bases in answering the set
                       of exercises.
                              The formulas are presented in a manner that the students will be able to use them
                       right away.

                              Exercises in each lesson intend to help the students develop their analytical skills
                       in solving problems in Algebra. These exercises are given for the students to do at their
                       own pace.

               theoretical approach without formal proofs, explaining concepts intuitively and supporting them with
               abundant examples. The applications span a broad range of topics certain to appeal to the interests of
               students of diverse backgrounds and include problems in business, sports, health, architecture, education,
               entertainment, political science, psychology, history, criminal justice, the environment, transportation,
               physical sciences, demographics, eating habits, and travel and leisure. This text has the following features:

                       What should you know? enlists the learning targets that specifies the skills to be developed and
               serve as a guide for the learners to remain focused on the content of the instruction. This is written along
               with the introduction of the chapter.

                Brief Discussion of Module


               English is one of the most important languages in the world today. Facilitators are expected
               to develop new teaching techniques and strategies to administer the lessons of each
               courses offered to different educational institutions and foundations under the new normal
               setting.

               The English language is the most common language spoken everywhere. With the help of
               new technologies, English has been playing a major role in many sectors including, medicine
               engineering, and education, which, in today’s relevance, is the most important field where
               English is needed.

               This module is made to emphasize the characteristics of the English language which
               focuses on the macro skills; reading, writing, speaking and listening, that the preservice
               teachers should demonstrate and manifest. Also, in preparing the preservice teachers to
               create a narrative report that is needed and essential to their final requirement in the
               program.]]></page><page Index="17"><![CDATA[iii                                              ENGL 130: English for Special Purposes

               graduated high school in Trece Martires City National High School located at San Agustin,
               Trece Martires City, Cavite. I was able to make it through the special science curriculum and
               maintained it from first year until I graduated to fourth year high school. I finished my bachelor’s
               degree in Cavite State University- Don Severino de las Alas Campus and took the program of
               Bachelor of Secondary Education Major in English.
               I  am  currently  hired  at  Cavite  State  University  Tanza  Campus.  After  overcoming  all  the
               hardships with perseverance in the long years, I am looking forward to meet the peak of my
               victory and to see the best results of all my sacrifices together with my beloved parents. In my
               one year of teaching I believed that without any struggle in life there can be no progress so if
               you never go after what you want you will never have it so always be the best working person
               in the room. After all the circumstances that I faced I had considered that everyone has the
               power to empower. I also believed that Education is the passport to a better future.]]></page><page Index="18"><![CDATA[BSEE 24

               mission, core values, and quality policy.
                       This learning material will be uploaded weekly, during the whole program of the semester. We
               hope that through this module, BSEM 30 – Modern Geometry, and other modes of learning, we could

               guarantee your safety without compromising quality education. May we serve our purpose and go an
               extra mile amidst this crisis.

                  “We don’t read and write poetry because it’s cute. We read and write poetry because we are the
                members of the human race. And the human race is filled with passion. And medicine, law, business,
                  engineering, these are noble pursuits and necessary to sustain life. But poetry, beauty, romance,

                                            love, these are what we stay alive for.”

                       Number Theory is concerned with the properties of the set of integers.  Through
               this, we shall discuss the set of integers that cover Euclid’s algorithm, divisibility, unique
               factorization  theorem,  and  solutions  of  congruence  residue  system.    The  course  is
               basically axiomatic in nature and will focus on proving theorems and problem solving.

                       This  text  was  primarily  prepared  to  suit  the  needs  of  students  who  are  taking
               Number  Theory.      It  emphasizes  the  essential  elements  of  arithmetic  with  special
