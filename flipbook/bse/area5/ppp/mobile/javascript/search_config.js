Preparation of Research Proposal                                        The  making  of  the  research  and  development  plans  starts  when  the                               Director  of  Research  calls  for  an  annual  research  proposal  review.    Interested                               faculty researchers create capsule proposals in line with the University’s current                               research thrust/s and other fields of interest.  Faculty researchers having the same                               field of interest may form a research program consisting of various projects and                               studies.  Otherwise, a researcher may prepare his/her own project/study proposal                               in accordance with the University’s current thrust or with their respective fields of                               interest.    The  proponent  submits  the  capsule  research  proposal  thru  proper                               endorsement to the Research Director.  Appendix 1 shows the sample of standard                               research proposal format used by all researchers for external funding.                          Section 2.  Evaluation of Research Proposal                                       The  submitted  capsule  research  proposals  will  be  presented  by  the                               researcher in a Technical Review of Proposal (TRP) attended by the University                               Research  and  Extension  Council  (URDE  serving  as  panel  of  evaluators.  The                               Council is chaired by the Vice President for Research and Extension and co-chaired                               by the Director for Research.                                       Once  the  proposals  are  presented,  the  committee  reviews  the  title,                               rationale, objectives, expected output, methodology, and budget of the research                               proposals.  The evaluators must provide relevant comments and suggestions on                               how  to further improve the contents of the proposals.

Rationale                               Republic Act No. 8293, otherwise known as the Intellectual Property Code of the                        Philippines, states that:                                “The State recognizes that an effective intellectual and industrial property system                        is  vital  to  the  development  of  domestic  and  creative  activity,  facilitates  transfers  of                        technology, attracts foreign investments, and ensures market access for our products.  It                        shall protect and secure the exclusive rights of scientist, inventors, artists and other gifted                        citizens to their intellectual property and creations, particularly when beneficial to the                        people.”                                With the various intellectual properties (IP’s) developed in the university such as                        the  Aguinaldo  Blend  Coffee,  processed  products,  design  for  biogas  digester  and                        innumerable research outputs being presented for public consumption, a few of them                        were able to acquire protection. The biogas digester was just recently granted a patent,                        while research outputs/publications have been presented without copyright protection,                        except for some that were able to acquire ISBN registration from the National Library.                        Therefore,  the  University  must  develop  a  system  for  protecting  economically  viable                        intellectual properties to maximize gains that could finance more researches in the future.

Definition of Terms                                “Copyright”  is  the  protection  extended  to  expressions  and  not  to  ideas,                        procedures,  and  methods  of  operations  or  mathematical  concepts  as  such.  Such                        expressions may be in the forms of literary, scholarly, scientific and artistic works.                                “Intellectual Property or IP” is an asset that possesses commercial value which can                        be exploited to generate revenue. IP value lies in its utilization, not existence.                                “Intellectual Property Rights” or “IPR” refers to the entitlement and enjoyment of                        the attributes of ownership over intellectual properties. IPR consists of: a) Copyright and                        related rights; b) Trademarks and Service Marks; c) Geographic Indications; d) Industrial                        Designs;  e)  Patents;  f)  Layout-Designs  (Topographies)  of  Integrated  Circuits;  and  g)                        Protection  of  Undisclosed  Information.

A variety may be represented                        by seed, transplants, plants, tubers, and tissue culture plantlets.                                 “Prior art”    Everything made available to the public by means of a written or                        oral disclosure, by use, or in any other way, before the filing date or the priority date of                        the application claiming the invention. Prior use which is not present in the Philippines,                        even if widespread in a foreign country, cannot form part of the prior art if such prior use                        is not disclosed in printed documents or in any tangible form.

PROTECTING THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTIES OF                                      CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY                         I. Rationale                               Republic Act No. 8293, otherwise known as the Intellectual Property Code of the                        Philippines, states that:                                 “The State recognizes that an effective intellectual and industrial property system                        is  vital  to  the  development  of  domestic  and  creative  activity,  facilitates  transfers  of                        technology, attracts foreign investments, and ensures market access for our products.  It                        shall protect and secure the exclusive rights of scientist, inventors, artists and other gifted                        citizens to their intellectual property and creations, particularly when beneficial to the                        people.”                                 With the various intellectual properties (IP’s) developed in the university such as                        the  Aguinaldo  Blend  Coffee,  processed  products,  design  for  biogas  digester  and                        innumerable research outputs being presented for public consumption, a few of them                        were able to acquire protection. The biogas digester was just recently granted a patent,                        while research outputs/publications have been presented without copyright protection,                              Area V: Research                                                         49","PROGRAM PERFORMANCE PROFILE                  BSE                          except for some that were able to acquire ISBN registration from the National Library.                        Therefore,  the  University  must  develop  a  system  for  protecting  economically  viable                        intellectual properties to maximize gains that could finance more researches in the future.                          II. Definition of Terms                                “Copyright”  is  the  protection  extended  to  expressions  and  not  to  ideas,                        procedures,  and  methods  of  operations  or  mathematical  concepts  as  such.  Such                        expressions may be in the forms of literary, scholarly, scientific and artistic works.                                “Intellectual Property or IP” is an asset that possesses commercial value which can                        be exploited to generate revenue. IP value lies in its utilization, not existence.                                “Intellectual Property Rights” or “IPR” refers to the entitlement and enjoyment of                        the attributes of ownership over intellectual properties. IPR consists of: a) Copyright and                        related rights; b) Trademarks and Service Marks; c) Geographic Indications; d) Industrial                        Designs;  e)  Patents;  f)  Layout-Designs  (Topographies)  of  Integrated  Circuits;  and  g)                        Protection  of  Undisclosed  Information.   IPR  shall  likewise  include  plant  varieties  and                                                               3                        animal breeds.                                “Patent” is a grant issued by the Philippine government giving an inventor the                        right  to  exclude  others  from  making,  using,  setting,  or  importing  the  product  of  his                        invention within the Philippines in exchange of his patentable information or disclosure.                                “Patentable inventions”      means  any  technical  solution  of  a  problem  in  any                        field  of  human  activity  which  is  new,  involves  an  inventive  step  and  is  industrially                        applicable, which may be, or may related to a product, or process, or an improvement of                        any of the foregoing.                                            4                                “Plant  variety”  means  a  plant  grouping  within  a  single  botanical  taxon  of  the                        lowest known rank which can be defined by the expression of the characteristics resulting                        from a given genotype, or combination of genotypes, distinguished from any other plant                        groupings by the expression of at least one characteristic and considered as a unit with                        regard to the suitability for being propagated unchanged. A variety may be represented                        by seed, transplants, plants, tubers, and tissue culture plantlets.                                 “Prior art”    Everything made available to the public by means of a written or                        oral disclosure, by use, or in any other way, before the filing date or the priority date of                        the application claiming the invention. Prior use which is not present in the Philippines,                        even if widespread in a foreign country, cannot form part of the prior art if such prior use                        is not disclosed in printed documents or in any tangible form.                         III. Objective                                 To  establish  a  system  protecting  the  intellectual  properties  (IP’s)  or                        results/products generated through researches conducted in the university.                            3  Section 4, R.A. 8293 (1998); TRIPS.                        4  Section 21, R.A. 8293 (1998).

Strategy                                The University shall establish an IPR Office that covers all intellectual property                        protection activities and provide trainings/seminars to researchers to increase awareness                        on IPR. The IPR Office will be divided in to two sections, each having IPR Assistants, one                        for patentable IP’s and the other for publishable IP’s.                                The IPR Officer will work under the Office of the Vice-President for Research,                        Extension,  Continuing  Education  and  Training  Services  (RECETS),  and  is  tasked  to                        identify,  protect  and  exploit  commercially  on  the  University’s  behalf  the  intellectual                        property rights generated by the University’s researchers.                                 The IPR Officer will be involved in identifying and protecting the University’s                        intellectual property rights, and in conforming to existing systems in managing, recording                        and tracking the progress of intellectual property applications and commercialization of                        the property. The IPR Officer will be required to work in close coordination with both                        research and academic units of the university to identify research results and intellectual                        property  rights  with  commercial  potential.  In  this  capacity  the  IPR  Assistants  will  be                        responsible  for  applying  for  and  liquidating  cash  advances  accrued  during  the                        applications and payment of other fees pertinent to the application. Where necessary the                        IPR Officer will work with the University’s legal advisers.                                 The IPR Officer and IPR Assistants will be provided with appropriate external                        training to ensure that they can become competent in all aspects of the role.                                 Other responsibilities include the following:                                Formulate,    propose     and     implement      governing     guidelines    in                        patenting/copyrighting research results in the University                                 Deal  with  agencies  requesting  for  commercialization  rights  for  patented/                        copyrighted materials from the university, enter into licensing agreements and manage                        the payment of royalties.
