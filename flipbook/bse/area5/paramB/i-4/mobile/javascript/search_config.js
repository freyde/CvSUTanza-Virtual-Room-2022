In line with the theme “Innovations Towards a Resilient, Healthy, and New Normal                Ready CALABARZON”, the RDC-RRIC calls for the submission of quality research                papers from the academe, research institutions (public and private), and consortia                                                                                       2                focusing  on  research  and  development  (R\&D)   and  innovation   that  support  the                                                                    1                development of the following sectors and specific topics:                 a)  Industry and Services (labor, employment, and MSMEs)                b)  Social  (education,  health,  gender  and  development,  disaster  risk  reduction                     and management)                c)  Infrastructure (Information and Communications Technology)                d)  Agriculture and fisheries (reducing vulnerability of agriculture to climate change,                     increasing productivity, innovative technologies)                 Participating Research Paper                 The  Call  is  open  to  all  scientists  and  researchers  (group  or  individual)  from                CALABARZON  state  universities  and  colleges,  government  agencies,  LGUs,  R\&D                institutions, higher education institutions, and private industries doing R\&D work.                       1  R\&D is any systematic and creative work undertaken to increase the stock of new knowledge (idea/knowledge                  generation) and the use of this idea/knowledge to devise new applications (technology generation). Prototyping                  is its culmination (Republic Act 11293 Implementing Rules and Regulations).                2  Innovation refers to the creation of new ideas that results in the development of new or improved products,                  processes, or services which are then spread or transferred across markets. Innovation applies to the entire                  spectrum of activities that provides value creation to the economy. Innovation thus covers commercialization,                  utilization and even extension of R\&D products, processes and services (RA11293 IRR).","Submission of Research Papers                 Participants must submit the following documents in electronic copy not later than                May 25, 2022 (Wednesday) by email to 2020researchforum4a@gmail.com:                    1.  accomplished registration form                    2.  one-page  Abstract  in  pdf  format,  250  to  300  words  including  keywords,                        single-spaced, font: Arial 11                    3.  endorsement by the head of agency/institution indicating that the paper has not                        been published, nor was it registered or submitted to the Intellectual Property                        Office of the Philippines (IPOPHL).
