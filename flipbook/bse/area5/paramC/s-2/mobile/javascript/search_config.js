Rationale                            Republic  Act  No.  8293,  otherwise  known  as  the  Intellectual                    Property Code of the Philippines, states that:                             “The  State  recognizes  that  an  effective  intellectual  and  industrial                    property  system  is  vital  to  the  development  of  domestic  and  creative                    activity,  facilitates  transfers  of  technology,  attracts  foreign  investments,                    and ensures market access for our products.  It shall protect and secure                    the  exclusive  rights  of  scientist,  inventors,  artists  and  other  gifted                    citizens  to  their  intellectual  property  and  creations,  particularly  when                    beneficial to the people.”                             With  the  various  intellectual  properties  (IP’s)  developed  in  the                    university  such  as  the  Aguinaldo  Blend  Coffee,  processed  products,                    design  for  biogas  digester  and  innumerable  research  outputs  being                    presented  for  public  consumption,  a  few  of  them  were  able  to  acquire                    protection. The biogas digester was just recently granted a patent, while                    research  outputs/publications  have  been  presented  without  copyright                    protection,  except  for  some  that  were  able  to  acquire  ISBN  registration                    from  the  National  Library.  Therefore,  the  University  must  develop  a                    system  for  protecting  economically  viable  intellectual  properties  to                    maximize gains that could finance more researches in the future.                      II. Definition of Terms                             “Copyright” is  the  protection  extended  to  expressions  and  not  to                    ideas, procedures, and methods of operations or mathematical concepts                    as  such.  Such  expressions  may  be  in  the  forms  of  literary,  scholarly,                    scientific and artistic works.                            “Intellectual Property or IP” is an asset that possesses commercial                    value  which  can  be  exploited  to  generate  revenue.  IP  value  lies  in  its                    utilization, not existence.                            “Intellectual Property Rights” or “IPR” refers to the entitlement and                    enjoyment of the attributes of ownership over intellectual properties. IPR                    consists  of:  a)  Copyright  and  related  rights;  b)  Trademarks  and  Service                    Marks;  c)  Geographic  Indications;  d)  Industrial  Designs;  e)  Patents;  f)                    Layout-Designs (Topographies) of Integrated Circuits; and g) Protection of                                                                                                               319","CvSU MANUAL OF OPERATIONS                    _____________________________________________________________________                                                                                                             320                    Undisclosed Information.

A variety may                    be  represented  by  seed,  transplants,  plants,  tubers,  and  tissue  culture                    plantlets.                             “Prior art”   Everything made available to the public by means of a                    written or oral disclosure, by use, or in any other way, before the filing                    date  or  the  priority  date  of  the  application  claiming  the  invention.                    Prior use which is not present in the Philippines, even if widespread in a                    foreign country, cannot form part of the prior art if such prior use is not                    disclosed in printed documents or in any tangible form.                      III. Objective                             To establish a system protecting the intellectual properties (IP’s) or                    results/products  generated  through  researches  conducted  in  the                    university.                     IV. Strategy                             The  University  shall  establish  an  IPR  Office  that  covers  all                    intellectual property protection activities and provide trainings/seminars                    to  researchers  to  increase  awareness  on  IPR.  The  IPR  Office  will  be                    divided in to two sections, each having IPR Assistants, one for patentable                    IP’s and the other for publishable IP’s.
