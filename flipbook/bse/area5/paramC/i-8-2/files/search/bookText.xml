          Introduction:              Curriculum, instruction, and assessment are the three essential components
                             of an education system, whether online or face to face (Orlando, 2011).  These three
                             components  must  be  equally  strengthen  for  a  successful  teaching  and  learning
                             process.  To achieve desired learning outcomes, successful integration of content and
                             meaningful assessment with effective pedagogy is necessary (Roth, 2017).  In the
                             advent of COVID-19 pandemic, Philippine higher education institutions (HEIs) have
                             explored  and  shifted  to  other  innovative  learning  modalities  that  transmigrate  the
                             conduct  of  classes  from  traditional  or  face-to-face  to  flexible  learning  modalities.
                             During these critical times, the development of coherent and cohesive curriculum is
                             seemingly  overwhelming,  even  to  experienced  teachers.  Crizaldo,  Fabregar,  and
                             Alitagtag  (2020)  recommended  ten  priority  areas  to  consider  in  the  successful
                             implementation of flexible learning in the new normal; student competency being the
                             most crucial.  In the delivery of flexible learning, students and faculty are expected to
                             redesign a teaching-learning experience adaptive of the new normal so that optimum
                             results can be achieved.
                                     As assessment stimulates learner's attitudes and behaviors towards learning
                             a  certain  competency,  it  must  be  constructively  aligned  with  the  curriculum  and
                             instruction. Its results must be communicated to the learners to keep an eye on the
                             progress  of  attaining  targets  so  that  appropriate  intervention  could  be  done  if
                             necessary.  However, in most (if not all) cases, teachers and administrators are often
                             concerned about what to teach and how to teach such content, leaving behind the
                             assessment component.  As a result, the assessment component is often to be the
                             weakest  of  the  three,  the  least  understood  and  the  least  effectively  implemented.
                             Assessment protocols are seemingly important to be integrated into curriculum if a
                             well-established  degree  of  success  in  reaching  the  desired  learning  outcomes  is
                             desired.  Understanding by Design (UbD) by Grant Wiggins and Jay McTighe provides
                             a framework that systematically addresses these key issues in a practical manner.
                                     Guided  by  the  UbD  framework,  this  research  will  help  determine  specific
                             knowledge  and  skills  to  be  assessed  in  a  particular  discipline  in  flexible  learning
                             environment, including evidences of understanding and effective tools that best match
                             in attaining these competencies.  Furthermore, instruction will be so designed to equip
                             students  to  best  meet  these  knowledge  and  skills.    An  assessment  guide  will  be
                             developed based on these elements.

          Objectives:               Assessment is done primarily on boosting student learning and development,
                             and rather than merely according grades.  It affords learners an opportunity to reflect
                             on their performance and determine the extent of their progression towards achieving
                             learning targets with the aid of teacher's feedback.  When learning institutions engage
                             in  particular  instructional  strategies,  they  will  in  fact  be  trying  to  align  learning
                             outcomes with certain assessment methodologies.  However, due to a number of key
                             variables affecting the effectiveness of assessment in education, learning outcomes
                             are often assessed several times with no rationale.  Thus, this study will be conducted
                             to determine assessment strategies that could improve student's learning in the new
                             normal  classroom  set  up.    Following  the  understanding  by  design  framework  ®

          Procedure/         Conceptual Framework of the study
          Methodology
                                    The  Input-Process-Output  model  will  be  used  to  illustrate  the  major
                             components of this study.
                                    The input is composed of the learning targets (specific knowledge and skills),
                             assessment tools, evidence of learning (or understanding) and learning activities.
                                    The process involves an analysis of the input in order to come up with the
                             desired  output  of  the  study.  This  research  project  rests  on  the  Understanding  by
                             Design® framework (UbD™ framework) developed by Wiggins, G., & McTighe, J.
                             (1998). It offers a planning process which aims to structure curriculum, assessment,
                             and  instruction  which  1)  focus  on  teaching  and  assessing  for  understanding  and
                             learning transfer, and 2) design curriculum  "backward" from those ends. The UbD
                             framework offers a three-stage backward design process for curriculum planning.
                                    The output is the assessment guide that will be proposed to assist educators
                             in determining effective assessment tools used in flexible learning.  Along this line, an
                             assessment guide will be developed and designed to further provide  alignment of
                             assessment to curriculum and instruction.




















                                                        Figure 1.  Research Concept Frame

                                    The Understanding by Design framework is described as follows:
                                    Stage 1: Identify desired results focuses on identifying the enduring concepts
                             and  desired  student  outcomes  before  outlining  specifics  of  the  content.  Enduring
                             concepts  are  important  ideas  or  core  processes  that  are  transferable  to  new
                             situations, have lasting value beyond the classroom, are at the heart of the discipline,
                             and are often abstract, counterintuitive, and misunderstood. What should students
                             know,  understand,  and  be  able  to  do?  What  is  worthy  of  understanding?  This
                             approach avoids two critical errors in teaching: textbook coverage or teaching for rote
                             memorization  and activity-based  teaching  that  may  be  engaging  but  has  no  clear
                             priorities.  Ideas  are  provided  for  differentiating  enduring  understandings  from  the
                             knowledge and skills supporting those understandings and from second-level skills or
                             factual knowledge.
                                    Stage  2:  Determine  acceptable  evidence concentrates  on  the  variety  and
                             depth of assessment tasks that are needed to validate that the student has achieved
                             the  desired  enduring  understanding.  How  will  a  teacher  know  if  students  have
                             achieved the desired results? Students reveal understanding when they participate in
                             complex,  authentic  opportunities  to  engage  in  the  six  facets  of  understanding
                             identified by Wiggins and McTighe:
                                       •  Explanation provides thorough, supported, and justified accounts of
                                           phenomena, facts, and data.]]></page><page Index="11"><![CDATA[B.  TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION

                                           relevancy and long-term retention.
                                       •  Application provides opportunities to utilize and apply understanding
                                           in diverse contexts.

                                           picture.
                                       •  Empathy finds value in what others might find odd, alien, or
                                           implausible; i.e., to perceive sensitively on the basis of prior direct
                                           experience.
                                       •  Self-knowledge recognizes that personal style, prejudices,
                                           projections, and habits of mind shape and impede one's own
                                           understanding.
                                    Meaningful assessment requires a variety of tools, including informal checks
                             in  class,  observation  and  student  dialogue,  formal  quizzes  and  tests,  academic
                             prompts,  and  open-ended  assessment  tasks.  GRASPS  (goal,  role,  audience,
                             situation, product or performance, standards for success) is provided as a prompt for
                             the teacher in constructing quality performance tasks scenarios. UbD then embarks
                             on an in-depth discussion of designing appropriate scoring rubrics. Effective rubrics
                             relate specific task requirements to more general performance goals, discriminate
                             among different degrees of understanding or proficiency, do not combine independent
                             criteria, and include all potential performance outcomes differentiating from novice to
                             expert. The more open-ended the assessment tasks, the more essential a strong
                             rubric becomes.
                                    Stage  3:  Plan  learning  experiences  and  instruction occurs  when  enduring
                             understandings and appropriate evidence of understanding culminate in an effective
                             instructional activity. It is often the case that assessment in the classroom begins with
                             stage 3, where a teacher's favorite activity is conducted in class without consideration
                             of expected outcome or adequate assessment. The backward design process flips
                             from starting at stage 3 to beginning at stage 1 and moving to stage 3. The driving
                             factor  is  the  enduring  concept,  not  the  activity.  Stage  3  essentially  asks,  "What
                             activities will equip students with the desired knowledge and skills?" This requires the
                             teacher to consider the intersection of engaging tasks and effective tasks. Activities
                             at this intersection motivate students to explore understandings and misconceptions.
                                    The sieve for activity design is called  WHERE. How will you help students
                             know  Where  they  are  headed  and Why?  How  will  you Hook  students  through
                             engaging and thought-provoking experiences? What events, real or simulated, can
                             students Experience to make the ideas and issues real? What learning activities will
                             help students to Explore the big ideas and essential questions? What instruction is
                             needed to Equip students for the final performance? How will you cause students
                             to Reflect and Rethink to dig deeper into the core ideas? How will you guide students
                             in Rehearsing, Revising,  and Refining  their  work  based  on  feedback  and  self-
                             assessment?  How  will  students Exhibit  their  understanding  about  their  final
                             performances and products? How will you guide them in self-Evaluation to identify the
                             strengths and weaknesses in their own work and set future goals?
                                    A key concept in UbD framework is alignment – all three stages must clearly
                             align  not  only  to standards,  but also  to one another.  In  other  words,  the  Stage 1
                             content and understanding must be what is assessed in Stage 2 and taught in Stage
                             3. The research process is resembled in Figure 1, where the UbD is used as the main
                             framework.]]></page><page Index="12"><![CDATA[B.  TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION

                            a.  Locale of the Study
                                       The study will be conducted at Cavite State University trying to determine
                                the assessment strategies used in flexible learning environment across various
                                disciplines.

                            b.  Research Design
                                       The  study  will  use  a  descriptive-evaluative  research  design  in  order  to
                                come up with the desired outputs. The descriptive nature of this research will be
                                used  to  understand  and  describe  the  assessment  strategies  used  in  flexible
                                learning  environment  in  the  new  normal.    The  evaluative  component  of  the
                                research design will be used to measure the effectiveness of these strategies,
                                especially in attaining learning targets and designing learning activities.

                            c.  Sampling Procedure
                                       Purposive sampling will be used in selecting CvSU faculty participants to
                                this study.  Those faculty members with less than a year of teaching experience
                                will  be  removed  from  the  list  since  they  are  yet  to  have  experienced  some
                                assessment strategies, both in the face-to-face and in the new normal.

                            d.  Data Collection Procedure
                                       Study 1-5.  Data will be collected among the participants through online
                                surveys  and  focus  group  discussion.  There  will  be  three  sets  of  research
                                instruments to be used in this study. The first instrument contains the modalities
                                and tools used in assessing student's learning in the new normal and this has two
                                versions: one for the student and one for the instructor/professor.
                                       The second instrument is the interview protocol that will be used during the
                                focus  group  discussion.    It  is  intended  for  interview  of  selected  students  and
                                instructor/professors involved in the study.
                                       Finally, a Virtual Classroom Assessment Observation Protocol is prepared
                                to  determine  the  detailed  assessment  used  by  each  faculty  member  in  their
                                course/s handled.
                                       Sample  assessment  activities/outputs  such  as,  but  not  limited  to,
                                examinations with TOS, rubrics, performance tasks, written tasks, portfolio, and
                                self-report, will be collected from the students and instructor/professors.
                                       Data that will be gathered in Studies 1-5 will be used to formulate flexible
                                learning assessment framework that any educator can be used in the new normal.
                                Using  this  proposed  framework,  an  assessment  guide  will  be  designed  and
                                developed  that  will  further  assist  educators  in  effectively  aligning  curriculum,
                                instruction and assessment. The developed assessment guide will be validated by
                                three experts before it could finally be used.

                                       Study 6. The developed assessment guide will be introduced to faculty
                                members in the CvSU system through series of webinar and trainings before the
                                start of the semester of AY 2022 – 2023.  Its acceptability will be determined.  A
                                rating  system  will  be  used  to  evaluate  the  developed  assessment  guide  on
                                assessment  of  learning  in  the new normal.    This  is  intended  for  evaluation  by
                                students, instructor/professor, and experts.

                                       Prior  to  the  actual  distribution  of  the  instrument,  the  developed
                                questionnaires will be pre-tested to selected students and some faculty members]]></page><page Index="13"><![CDATA[B.  TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION

                                who were not part of the study to determine its validity and reliability.  Once validity
                                and reliability are established, this will be sent to the students and faculty members
                                involved in the study.  An online form of these questionnaires will be prepared to
                                reduce the cost of transportation and reproduction of research instruments.

                            e.  Data Analysis
                                      The  developed  questionnaires  will  be  subjected  to  validation  by  some
                                experts in the field. Cohen's Kappa coefficient will be used to measure the inter-
                                rater reliability or agreement between two or more experts to assess the validity of
                                these documents.
                                      All  data  to  be  gathered  will  be  tabulated  and  analyzed  accordingly.
                                Descriptive statistics such as, but not limited to, frequency counts, ranks, means,
                                and percentages, will be used to describe the primary data that will be collected
                                among the graduates and employers. The data will be treated and analyzed using
                                appropriate  statistical  tests  with  the  aid  of  the  Statistical  Packages  for  Social
                                Sciences v. 22.
                                      Weighted means will be computed based on the participants' responses and
                                will be converted accordingly.

                            f.  Monitoring and evaluation
                                       As  part  of  monitoring  activities,  quarterly  meeting  and  report  will  be
                                conducted and submitted.  This is to ensure that every activity is implemented as
                                planned and every problem encountered is resolved.

                            g.  Ethical Considerations
                                       Informed consent from the university president and campus administrators
                                will be obtained using relevant documentation before the conduct of the study.
                                These documents will include informed invitation letters to conduct the research
                                at the university and its campuses, informed invitation letters to participants and
                                the learners for their participation.
                              To protect their basic rights, privacy, and confidentiality, all direct identifiers will be
                                  removed.  Before and during the transcriptions of the observed lessons, all
                              participants will be given fictive names, as well as with the pre-service teacher and
                              school.  This is an important step that none of the participants will be recognizable.
                                Data will be filed in separate secure locations to protect all participants against
                               indirect identification.  Pseudonyms will also be used in the discussion of results.

         recommendatio ns       Management, BS Information Technology, BS Psychology, and others, found it difficult
                                to respond in some parts of the questionnaire due to the technicality and unfamiliarity
                                of the names and/or use of assessment tools in higher education. The researchers
                                then included some definitions of those unfamiliar terms and also translated them in

                                                B.  TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION
          Rationale:
                                  Employability  is  more  than  merely  getting  a  job  but  implies  a  set  of
                           achievement  in  terms  of  skills,  understandings  and  personal  attributes.  Developing
                           competent graduates whose skills and capabilities can readily respond to the dynamic
                           needs of the industry is a vital role of higher education institutions (HEIs).  HEIs are
                           challenged  to  evaluate  their  curriculum  to  ensure  the  fit  between  graduate
                           competencies  and  those  required  by  employers,  stressing  on  specific  and  well-
                           targeted  skills  to  guarantee  an  effective job market placement  of  its  graduates.   In
                           addition, Javier (2018) reiterated that graduates should have gained the appropriate
                           competencies  and  skills  in  their  field  of  specialization  upon  graduation  and  before
                           applying to the workplace of their choice.

                                  One  way  of  evaluating  the  results  of  education  and  training  provided  in  the
                           HEIs is the conduct of a graduate tracer study.  It is an efficient mechanism to monitor
                           graduates’  employability,  evaluate  their  workplace  performance,  and  establish  the
                           effectiveness  and  responsiveness  of  curricular  programs  offered  in  any  HEI.    Data
                           generated  from  the  tracer  study  could  re-evaluate  the  factors  affecting  and
                           contributing to the status of employment of graduates.

                                  Cavite State University – Tanza Campus, being a primary tertiary education in
                           the municipality of Tanza, Cavite, aims to ensure that graduates of the campus have
                           extensive  education  and  training  for  them  to  be  equipped  with  competencies,
                           knowledge and skills in their field of study and be prepared to become part of their
                           chosen industry.  In order for the campus to monitor its graduates on a periodic basis,
                           the conduct  of  tracer study  is necessary.    Hence,  a  graduate  tracer study  is  being
                           proposed  to  determine  the  workplace  performance  of  CvSU  –  Tanza  Campus
                           graduates.  Consequently,  the  study  could  provide  insights  about  the  level  of
                           workplace  preparedness  and  attitude  of  its  graduates  as  well  as  the  employers’
                           satisfaction  on  the  workplace  performance  and  attitudes.  In  addition,  the  study  will
                           also determine the relevance and responsiveness of CvSU – TC curricular programs
                           to the needs of the industry based on its graduates’ quality of performance. Moreover,
                           the  results  of  the  findings  will  serve  as  significant  inputs  to  the  curriculum
                           development of the University to meet local and global demands for a highly skilled
                           labor force.


          Objectives:               The industry relies so much on higher education institutions in training and
                           preparing graduates for the workplace.  Due to this, higher education institutions find
                           ways to make their curriculum responsive to the needs of the industry. Cavite State
                           University – Tanza finds it crucial to ensure that effective and efficient programs are
                           provided  to  produce  a  human  workforce  capable  of  contributing  to  national
                           development.  Thus,  this  study  will  be  conducted  to  determine  the  workplace
                           performance  of  CvSU  –  Tanza  graduates.  Furthermore,  it  also  aims  to  develop  a
                           graduate tracer mobile application and information system that can be used by the
                           office of student affairs and services to find required alumni data which can be used
                           for accreditation and other purposes.

                                  The  four  component  studies  are  specifically  done  to  obtain  answers  to  the
                           following objectives:

          Literature:          Graduate competencies and employability
                                      Studies have attempted to unpack the demand of competencies at work in
                               relation  to  how  they  contribute  to  work  readiness,  profitability  and  work
                               performance (Pang et al., 2018). Fleming et al. (2009) conducted a study among
                               industrial supervisors, students and graduates, who rated 24 competencies. They
                               found that ‘ability and willingness to learn’, ‘initiative’ and ‘personal planning and
                               organizational skills’ bore the highest ratings among the competencies students
                               needed  to  master  before  starting  their  cooperative  educational  experiences.  In
                               response  to  a  survey  of  employers  conducted  in  Scotland,  ‘trustworthiness’,
                               ‘reliability’,  ‘motivation’,  ‘communication  skills’  and  ‘willingness  to  learn’  were
                               considered  the  most  important  transferable  skills  when  hiring  graduates
                               (McMurray et al., 2016).
                                      According to Abas and Imam in 2016, one critical measure of success in
                               workplaces is an employee’s ability to use competently the knowledge, skills and
                               values that match the needs of his job, satisfy the demands of his employer, and
                               contribute to the overall achievement of institutional goals.

                               Employers’ views on graduate competencies
                                      Deaconu  et  al.  (2014)  reported  that  employers  were  most  satisfied  with
                               graduates’  abilities  in  ‘assuming  responsibility’,  ‘efficient  activity  planning  and
                               organization’  and  ‘promptness  and  efficient  time  management’.  The  results  of
                               content-analysed  data  collected  through  critical  incident  interviews  on
                               competencies by Ryan et al. (2012) indicate that the presence of skills in ‘team
                               leadership’,  ‘achievement  orientation’,  ‘developing  others’  and  ‘impact  and
                               influence on others’ predicts business profitability.
                                      Employers  require  graduates  to  have  the  fundamental  technical  skills
                               necessary for their specific professions (Low et al., 2016). However, beyond that,
                               studies  have  found  that  soft  skills  have  been  receiving  greater  attention  in
                               organizations (Stewart et al., 2016) and higher education (Pang and Hung, 2012).
                               Based on data gathered from job advertisements placed in the careers section of
                               newspapers, Dunbar et al. (2016) found that employers placed greatest emphasis
                               on soft skills and discussed technical skills to a lesser extent. Further supporting
                               this hypothesis, an online survey conducted in the United Kingdom concluded that
                               human  resource  professionals  were  very  impressed  with  graduates’  technical
                               skills, but expressed concerns about their soft skills and attributes (Poon, 2014). A
                               study  soliciting  comments  from  the  Romanian  labour  market  revealed  that
                               employers viewed transversal competencies as more important than professional
                               ones (Deaconu et al., 2014). In a study surveying 143 organizations, Jackson and
                               Chapman (2012) found that students were confident and proficient on technical
                               aspects but significantly deficient in managerial skill sets.

                               Current conceptualizations of graduate work readiness
                                      The evident lack of clarity and consensus on what defines work readiness
                               may be due to the fact  that, as  a  construct, it  is  still  in  the  early  stages  of
                               development.    The  emergence  of interest  in work  readiness can  be  linked  to
                               the  increasing  demand  from  employers  for graduates to possess a diverse
                               range of generic graduate attributes or generic skills (Hager &  Holland,  2006).
                               This    trend    has    resulted    from   economic    and    technological    developments
                               which  have  significantly  changed  the  nature  of  the  workplace.    The  term
                               generic    skills    is  used    interchangeably    with    related    terms    including    “core
                               skills”,  “basic  skills”,  “transferable skills”  and  “employability  skills”.    It  refers
                               to  a  range  of  qualities  and  capacities  that  are viewed as important in the
                               preparation  for  work  in  almost  any  job.    Examples  of  generic  skills  include
                               communication, problem solving and working with others.   Alternatively,  Hager
                               and Holland  argue  that  generic  graduate attributes  go  beyond  technical  skills
                               to  also  include attitudes,  values  and  dispositions.   The various combinations of
                               attributes and skills that a graduate applies in different contexts can be referred to
                               as capabilities (Hager, 2006).  Consistent  with  the interchangeable terms used
                                                                                               V01-2018-05-30]]></page><page Index="25"><![CDATA[9

                               to  describe generic  skills  and  attributes, different  labels  are also used in  the
                               literature  to    describe    the    notion    of  work    readiness  including    “work
                               preparedness”,    “graduate    employability”,    “transferable    skills”    and    “generic

                                      The findings by Carless (2007) in particular, provide some useful insight
                               into the practices of Australian   organizations.    The   most   common   methods
                               used   by   the   50   Australian organizations  surveyed,  in  order  of  popularity
                               were,  application  forms,  interviews,  cognitive ability  tests,  personality  tests
                               and    assessment  centers.    These  selection  methods    are    each  designed    to
                               predict    different    dimensions    of    performance    criteria,    however,    not    all
                               methods  are  employed  in  the  same  selection  process.    According  to  Carless,
                               while  more  than  half  of  the  Australian      organizations      utilized      a      selection
                               battery   comprising three   methods: application forms, interviews and one other
                               selection method of choice, 42% indicated they only used application forms and
                               interviews to select graduate applicants. Although  these methods  have  been
                               shown  to  demonstrate  validity  across  occupational  groups  and  in various
                               contexts,  it  is  less  clear  how  effective  they  are  in  assessing  potential  in
                               graduate applicants.  In particular the fact that some organizations only rely on the
                               use of application forms  and  interviews  raises  concerns  about  the  ability  of
                               current  assessment  methods  in being able to examine graduate work readiness
                               as a construct in itself.
                                      Mintz (2019) enumerated concerns about career readiness of graduates. It
                               is  said  that  college  education  is  “excessively  theoretical  and  disconnected  from
                               [the]  real  world”.  Also,  students  are  said  to  be  lack  of  necessary  skills  and
                               experience  that  the  employers  are  looking  for  and  lack  of  “realistic  career
                               aspirations” or plan to fulfill their goals. In a 2017 survey conducted by Gallup and
                               Strada  (as  cited  by  Mintz,  2019),  only  a  third  of  32,000  college  students  they
                               asked  are  confident  that  they  will  graduate  with  the  necessary  skills  and
                               knowledge that the employers are seeking and only half of them think that they
                               will  have  a  good  job  with  their  major.  In  addition,  less  than  half  of  the  recent
                               college  graduates  were  competent  in  oral  and  written  communication  and  only
                               56% excel in critical thinking and problem solving based on a survey conducted
                               by the National Association of Colleges and Employers (as cited by Mintz, 2019).
                               He wrote that universities can better prepare students by providing students and
                               faculties insights about employment trends, outcomes, and earnings. They should
                               also  embed  career  exploration,  align  curricula  with  workforce  outcomes,  and
                               connect students with alumni and employers.

                               Employability Skills Framework
                                             Jackson  and  Chapman’s  (2011)  framework  of  20  skills,  broadly
                               considered to represent typical industry skill requirements of business graduates.
                               Jackson  and  Chapman’s  own  framework  derived  from  an  extensive  review  of
                               employer-based studies on industry-relevant skill requirements in undergraduates.
                               To  measure  the  perception  of  graduates  on  their  preparedness,  satisfaction  of
                               employers on the employment performance of the graduates, and to characterize
                               graduates’  workplace  performance  as  perceived  by  employers,  the  proposed
                               study will adapt the skills framework from the instrument used by Jackson et. al, in
                               2013  in  their  study.  These  are;  effective;  communication  skills  self-awareness;
                               critical  thinking  skills;  data  analyzing  skills  and  use  of  technology;  problem-
                               solving; working effectively with others; initiative and enterprise development; self-
                               management ;social responsibility; professionalism.

                               Employers’ satisfaction on the work attitudes of graduates
                                          Plantilla in 2017, used ten personal qualities to measure the satisfaction of
                               employers to the attitude of the graduates, these are; 1.) Flexibility (responds well


                                                                                               V01-2018-05-30]]></page><page Index="26"><![CDATA[10

                               to  change,  2.)  Creativity  (identifies  new  approaches  to  problem),  3.)  Empathy
                               (understands the situations, feelings, or motives of others), 4.) Reliability (can be
                               depended  on  to  complete  work  assignments),  5.)  Integrity  (understands  and
                               applies  ethical  principles  to  decisions),  6.)  Self-discipline  (exhibits  control  of
                               personal  behavior),  7.)  Work  Optimism  (positive  attitude  toward  work.),  8.)
                               Enthusiasm  (willingness  to  learn),  9.)  Compliance  (understands  and  takes
                               directions  for  work  assignments),  and 10.)  Accountability  (accepts  responsibility
                               for  consequences  of  actions).  These  will  also  be  adapted  to  measure  work
                               attitude perceived by graduates and to measure the satisfaction of employers to
                               the work performance and attitudes of the graduates.
                                         As  a  result  on  his  study,  employers  were  extremely  satisfied  with  the
                               personal qualities exhibited by the graduates in workplace. They were extremely
                               satisfied with the graduates on their willingness to learn, positive attitude towards
                               work  responsibility  and  ability  to  take  directions  and  assignments.  Employers
                               considered  all  the  stated  personal  qualities  as  extremely  important  for  the
                               employees  to  successfully  perform  their  job.  They  put  much  premium  on  self-
                               discipline,  positive  attitude  towards  work  and  willingness  to  learn  as  important
                               qualities  of  an  employee.  These  personal  qualities  should  emanate  to  the
                               graduates for them to be hired in their jobs.

                               Relevance and Responsiveness of curricular program in the Philippines
                                          Curriculum is a broad set of experiences that students go through during
                               the entire time they are in school. The curriculum is generally considered as the
                               complete  course  path  that  will  enable  students  to  attain  the  goals  and  general
                               objectives of education. It is the learner‘s engagement with various aspects of the
                               environment, which is under the direction of the school. Curriculum empowers all
                               students  and  motivates  them  towards  lifelong  learning.  But  because  of
                               technological  advancements,  the  spread  of  new  information  media  and  the
                               predominance of software and hardware devices, a school‘s curriculum should be
                               enhanced.  It  should  be  pragmatic  to  meet  the  needs  of  society  and  should
                               conform to the actualities of the community. A school‘s curriculum should be re-
                               structured  with  a  likely  shift  towards  a  more  meaningful  course  of  study.  It  is
                               indeed very important for an educational institution to have a balanced and well-
                               designed curriculum for all the programs it offers. In doing so, the institution shall
                               have a more stable system in undertaking its goals and mission so as to make its
                               curricular programs efficient and effective to its major concern – the students.
                                         Central to the realization of an institution‘s goal is continuity and innovation
                               anchored on a relevant curriculum. Change in strategies, in the course contents,
                               in  methodologies  for  teaching,  is  well  recognized  as  sensitive,  difficult  and
                               sometimes,  impossible,  so  much  so  that  the  acceptance  of  the  status  quo  is
                               pervasive.  There  is  a  great  belief  that  if  a  plan  is  well  planned  and  based  on
                               logical theories and goals; there is nothing that will prevent it from being initiated.
                               Yet, it will also be noted that a quite a number of elaborately planned innovations
                               and  curricular  changes  have  floundered  on  the  threshold  of  the  bureaucratic
                               organization (Hagos & Dejarme, 2008).

                               From  Curriculum  to  Career:  Connecting  Curriculum  Outcomes  to  Future
                               Careers
                                          Students often arrive at university level instruction with some idea of
                               their future employment direction. It is important for university instructors to
                               seize their student’s career enthusiasm and foster a connection between the
                               curriculum  and  potential  future  career  applications.  Providing  students  with
                               an  opportunity  to  connect  their  classroom  learning,  (online  or  face-to-face)
                               with workplace relevance will result in many positive learning outcomes such
                               as  motivation,  grit,  and  career  goal  setting.  As  stated  by  Schwartz,  Gregg,


                                                                                               V01-2018-05-30]]></page><page Index="27"><![CDATA[11

                               and McKee (2018) “Guidance and information focused on careers should be
                               included  throughout  one’s  undergraduate  experience”  (p.  51).  To  integrate
                               career  content  into  the  classroom  the  following  tips  are  suggested:
                               integrating  career  focused  topics  in  discussions  and  activities;  using  and
                               integrating  services  offered  by  career  resource  centers;  including  guest
                               speakers;  and  incorporating  additional  online  career  resources.  These
                               strategies help foster a connection between course material and professions
                               and careers students may be considering.
                                          Instructors have the unique opportunity to help students explore future
                               career  opportunities.  Research  has  shown  the  importance  of  providing
                               college-level students with the skills needed to explore career opportunities.
                               University  students  need  to  be  exposed  to  career  exploration  in  their  early
                               coursework,  via  classroom  discussions,  university  career  resources  and
                               online  career  sites,  and  real-world  speakers.  Career  education  is  a  lifelong
                               learning  experience  that  needs  to  have  a  greater  focus,  from  the  first
                               semester through the last, for all university students (Levin & Mudd, 2018).


                               Mobile Application Development
                                           In the modern age of Information and communication system, people
                               are  habituated  to  use  computer  and  computer  application.  But  Mobile
                               Application uses and development is a new and rapidly growing sector. There
                               is  a  global  positive  impact  of  mobile  application.  Using  mobile  application
                               developed country are becoming facilitate and people, society of developing
                               country  are  upgrading  themselves  and  making  a  new  type  of  IT
                               infrastructure.  Mobile  applications are running on  a small  hand  hold mobile
                               device  which  is  moveable,  easy  to  use  and  accessible  from  anywhere  and
                               any  place.  Now  a  day,  so  many  people  are  using  mobile  application  to
                               contact friends, browse internet, file content management, document creating
                               and  handling,  entertainment  etc.  From  everywhere  user  can  get  facility  of
                               mobile application. People can do many things of his daily life and business
                               life. Not only the mobile application has an impact for user but also it plays
                               an  important  role  in  business.  Many  business  companies  are  earning
                               revenue using mobile  application.  The  mobile  application has  an  impact on
                               society.  The mobile application  run  in a mobile environment  which usability
                               depends on several factors such as: Screen resolution, Hardware limitations,
                               Expensive Data Usage, Connectivity issues, Limited Interaction possibilities.
                               Last few years the mobile companies are trying to develop mobile device with
                               more  screen  resolution,  more  storage,  better  connectivity  which  provide
                               better environment for modern mobile application (Islam & Mazumder, 2010).
                                           Usability testing is a common tool used to evaluate the usability of a
                               mobile  application  in  a  development  process.  Usability  tests  are  usually
                               conducted using a think aloud protocol based on K. A. Ericsson and H. A. Simon’s
                               work (1980, 1984). Users are given tasks in a test environment and encouraged
                               to  think  aloud  while  trying  to  accomplish  the  tasks.  This  gives  usability
                               practitioners, information they need on how the user interface matches the natural
                               human way of thinking and acting and highlights the features and processes to be
                               improved (Kaikkonen et. al.,2005).

                                  and the respective employment sites where the CvSU-Tanza graduates were
                                  employed.

                               B. Sampling Procedure
                                       Complete enumeration of the CvSU-Tanza graduates from 2016 – 2020
                                  will be employed.  A total of 217 graduates will be considered in this study.

                               C. Data Collection Procedure
                                         There  will  be  two  questionnaires  to  be  used  in  this  study.    The  first
                                  questionnaire,  The Workplace Preparedness  and Attitudes  Inventory  (please
                                  see  Appendix  1),  has  three  parts  and  will  be  answered  by  the  CvSU  TC
                                  Graduates.  The first part will determine the profile of CvSU TC graduates as
                                  to their status, nature and area of employment.  The second part is expected
                                  to determine the level  of workplace preparedness and attitudes of CvSU-TC
                                  Graduates.    This  was  adapted  from  the  Employability  Skills  Framework  by
                                  Jackson,  D.,  Sibson,  R.  &  Riebe,  L.  (2013).  The  third  part  determines  the
                                  graduates’ workplace attitudes using the ten personal qualities of employees
                                  adapted  from  the  study  of  Plantilla  in  2017.The  fourth  part  determines  their
                                  perception of relevance and responsiveness of their curricular program to their
                                  current employment.
                                         The  second  questionnaire,  The  Employer’s  Feedback  (please  see
                                  Appendix 2), is intended for the employers of the CvSU-TC Graduates.  It has
                                  three  parts.    The  first  part  contains  information  relative  to  the  employer’s
                                  profile.  The second questionnaire determines their perception and satisfaction
                                  towards  quality  of  workplace  performance  of  CvSU  TC  graduates  who  were
                                  employed in their organization which was also adapted from the Employability
                                  Skills  Framework  (Jackson,  et.al,  2013).      The  third  part  determines  their
                                  perception  of  relevance  and  responsiveness  of  the  CvSU-TC  curricular
                                  programs based on the workplace performance of the latter’s graduates.
                                         The data that will be collected from the three studies will be utilized as
                                  basis for graduate tracing mobile application development.
                                         Prior  to  the  actual  distribution  of  the  instrument,  the  developed
                                  questionnaire  will  be  pre-tested  to  selected  graduating  students  and  some
                                  organization  leaders  who  were not part of  the study  to  determine  its validity
                                  and reliability.  Once validity and reliability are established, this will be sent to
                                  the  graduates  and  their  employers.    Simultaneously,  each  graduate  will  be
                                  contacted through any communication forms available such as, but not limited
                                  to,  texts,  social  media  sites,  and  emails.    An  online  form  (or  a  mobile
                                  application)  of  these  questionnaires  will  be  prepared  to  reduce  the  cost  of


                                                                                               V01-2018-05-30]]></page><page Index="29"><![CDATA[13

                                  D.  Data Analysis
                                         The developed questionnaires will be subjected to validation by some
                                   experts in the field.  Cohen’s Kappa coefficient will be used to measure the
                                   inter-rater reliability or agreement between two or more experts to assess the
                                   validity  of  these  documents.    On  the  other  hand,  Cronbach’s  alpha  will  be
                                   used  to  determine  the  internal  consistency  of  the  constructs  used  in  the
                                   survey when answered by a group of participants.
                                         All  data  to  be  gathered  will  be  tabulated  and  analyzed  accordingly.
                                   Descriptive  statistics  such  as,  but  not  limited  to,  frequency  counts,  ranks,
                                   means, and percentages, will be used to describe the primary data that will be
                                   collected among the graduates and employers.  Likert scales will be used to
                                   describe  the  variables  in  this  study.    Furthermore,  correlation  tests  will  be
                                   used to explore relationships among the variables involved in this study.  The
                                   data will be analyzed using the Statistical Packages for Social Sciences v. 22.
                                         Weighted  means  will  be  computed  based  on  the  participants’
                                   responses and will be converted accordingly:
