Since then, the Research                  Center (RC) has evolved to function as one of the trilogy roles of the University. To date, the                 University is the seat of the national research, development, and extension for coffee – a status                 bestowed by the Department of Agriculture Bureau of Agricultural Research.                          The  Research  Center  exerted  serious  efforts  toward  streamlining  the  Research,                 Development, and Extension (RDE) Program by establishing a strong and effective research                 program aimed to generate innovative and viable technologies useful to farmers and other                  clients.  This  is  done  with  the  goal  of  improving  their  standard  of  living.  The  University’s                 research  program  focuses  on  coffee  research,  development,  and  extension.  However,  to                 accommodate the ever-increasing need for RD\&E activities brought about by the development                 of  the  University  into  a  comprehensive  one,  these  thrusts  have  become  more  elaborate                 through the “Faculty and Students Research Capability Enhancement Program” that has been                 approved by the University Board of Regents in 2004.                           The  University  has  maintained  ties  and  established  collaborative  projects  with                 international  and  local  agencies  with  emphasis  on  plantation  crops,  high  value  fruits  and                 vegetables, ornamentals, herbs and spices and poultry and livestock among others.                          The research of the University is anchored into specific thrusts otherwise known as                 thematic areas which set the direction for the researchers on which disciplines or commodities                 to prioritize. These thrusts have evolved from fourteen to seven as follows: Strengthening                  Leadership in Coffee R\&D; Mainstreaming Kaong R\&D towards Environmental Protection and                 Poverty  Alleviation;  Sustainable  Agriculture  and  Fisheries;  Environment  and  Natural                 Resources; Engineering and Technology Development; Health and Wellness; and Human and                 Societal Development.","However, it was deemed appropriate to remove the first two thematic areas because                 these are commodity-focused. Presently, the research thematic areas are as follows: Agri-                 Fisheries  and  Food  Security;  Biodiversity  and  Environmental  Conservation;  Smart                 Engineering,  Information  and  Communication  Technology,  and  Industrial  Competitiveness;                  Social Development and Equality; and Public Health and Welfare.

Finance                         a.  Sources of Funds. Financial resources are generated through grants, donations,                            bilateral  agreements  and  collaborations  with  government  and  non-government                            agencies  private  institutions,  foreign  funding  institutions  and  other  research                            agencies and councils. There are two major classifications of fund sources: the                            internal and external funds. The internal funds come from the general appropriation                             allocation (GAA) of the Philippine government. The Center also generates fund                            from various income generating projects of the University and a portion of which is                            allocated for the conduct of the University’s research activities. On the other hand,                            the external funds can come from government agencies such as Department of                            Agriculture (DA), Department of Science and Technology (DOST), Commission on                            Higher Education (CHED), and others: private individuals and institutions both in                            the Philippines and abroad; foreign government, and non-government agencies                             such  as  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development  (USAID),  United                            Nations (UN) and others.                         b.  Handling of Research Funds.  All research funds are handled by the Finance                            Management Office in coordination with the Office of the Director for Research.                            Books of Accounts are kept by the Accounting Department under the supervision                             of  the  Vice  President  for  Administrative  and  Support  Services.  Personnel  is                            assigned  at  the  Accounting  Department  to  handle  documents  of  all  research                            projects of the University to expedite processing.                                       External research grants are treated as trust funds. Funds are released                            to the Accounting Department by project allotment whereby project/study leaders                            handle  the  processing  of  papers  to  release  the  fund  meant  for  their  research                            projects/studies. Research funds allocated  from the income generating projects","are also handled by the Accounting Department and managed by the Director for                            Research.                         c.  Management of Research Funds. Research funds shall be reported in terms of                            obligation or liquidation. The Accounting Department monitors the expenditures in                             accordance with the items in the budget and sub-allotment. Payrolls, vouchers,                            request for supplies and materials and other obligations of the projects shall be                            paid through the Accounting Department with approval from the Vice President for                            Administrative and Support Services following the accounting and auditing rules                            and  regulations.  As  with  any  government  agency,  expenditures  incurred  in  the                            implementation of research programs in State Universities and Colleges (SUCs)                             shall be subjected to auditing procedures prescribed by the Commission on Audit                            (COA).  The  internal  audit  which  is  under  the  supervision  of  the  Office  of  the                            President and a representative from COA shall conduct the auditing.                  Article  4.  System  of  Making  Research  and  Development  Plans  and  Research                 Opportunities in the University                         Section 1. Research and Development Planning Process.  The Research Center                 conducts  research  in  accordance  with  the  University’s  research  agenda  in  line  with  the                 regional, national, and global thrusts.                          Research planning involves the assessment of the external and internal environments                 and anchoring the results of the analysis with the University’s vision and mission.                         The external environment refers to the ecological, economic, legal, political, social and                 technological factors that affect the University while the internal environment considers the                 institutional capacity, structure, support, and systems affecting the organization.                         The  assessment  of the  environment  leads  to  the  analysis  of  the  opportunities  and                 threats (external analysis) as well as its strengths and weaknesses (internal analysis) which                  then leads to evaluation of the gaps in research that should be filled and hence, help plan the                 University's future directions.","Section 2. Research Opportunities                         Section 2.1.  CvSU Research and Creative works Grant. Cavite State University                         (CvSU) supports the research, development and creative activities of faculty members                         through the CvSU Research and Creative works Grant.  The grant is intended to bolster                          the  research  capacity  through  procuring/upgrading  equipment,  supplies  (e.g.                         glassware, chemicals, media, among others), software and other requirements which                         in the long run will build the current faculty strengths and establish the reputation of the                         laboratories/research  centers.  Researches  that  are  in  line  with  the  institutional,                         regional, national and global thrusts are encouraged. These include creative works or                         scientific queries that are curiosity- driven (involving basic research), problem-based                          (applied  research)  or  investigations  along  the  interface  of  traditional  disciplines.                         Proposals  with  innovative  and  creative  approaches  in  addressing  the  research                         problem/subject under study and of multidisciplinary and collaborative nature shall be                         given high priority.                         This grant will also support high quality creative works, enhancing the overall quality of artistic                         production of the university. Artistic disciplines include: visual arts (painting, drawing, sculpture,                          ceramics, and textiles), performing arts (dance, music, theatre), film, video, performance art,                         architecture, design, creative writing, interdisciplinary arts, media and digital/electronic arts, and                         new and innovative artistic practices.                         Overall, this aims to support scholarly pursuits, nurture creativity and innovation and                         promote a research culture in the University. Eventually, it is envisioned that through                         the CvSU Research and Creative works Grant, the University’s research and creative                         works  performance  shall  soar  through  increased  publication,  copyright,  and  patent                          certification.  The  knowledge  and  arts  created  and  the  technology  developed  shall                         eventually be cascaded to the community, consistent with the aspirations of becoming                         a global University in the near future.                                As a Level 4 AACCUP-accredited HEI, CvSU’s academic standing is measured                         by the quality of researches and instruction performance; with the weight of research                          and instruction among the highest in the parameters evaluated and of equal value.

The process of proposal preparation and submission of proposals is similar to the                         CRCG.                         Section 2.3. Undergraduate and Graduate Thesis Grant. This funding is for students                          who wish to avail of funding support for their thesis but could not because there is no                         faculty  research  project  to  anchor  their  thesis  into.  Undergraduate  thesis,  design                         projects,  case  studies,  and  other  researches  of  a  similar  nature  that  are  part of  a                         student's degree requirement for graduation and have corresponding credit need some                         form  of  financial  support  and  therefore,  must  be  considered  for  funding.  Similarly,                          graduate students of the university are also in need of financial support to complete                         their master's thesis or doctoral dissertation can avail of this funding support because","while these students can seek grants from external sources such as CHED or DOST,                          these grant-giving bodies are very selective and the evaluation process take some                         time.

A lower                            amount may be granted depending on the objectives of the study as determined                            by the Research Center. Moreover, a higher amount may be granted based on                             justifiable reasons and soundness of the proposal. The source of the funds will be                            the income of the University.                         Section 2.4. College/Campus Research Fund. The College/RDE research funds are                         allotted by the RDE unit as maintenance, operating, and other expenses (MOOE). The                         college research fund comes from the ten percent allocation for research as described                         in  the  CHED  Memorandum  Order  No.  20  Series  of  2011.  At  least  20%  of  the                         college/campus research fund shall be allotted to the conduct of R and D projects.                          Section  2.5.  External  Research  Grants.  Cavite  State  University  also  receives                         research  grants  and  support  from  several  government  institutions  as  well  as  non-                         government  organizations  (NGOs),  and  private  partners.  Some  of  the  government                         funding agencies that provide grant-in-aids for researches  at CvSU include CHED,                         DOST, and DA-BAR. Externally-funded R and D projects may be accommodated in a                          foundation. These need not pass the usual government purchasing and accounting                         process.  Further,  the  project  leader  and  staff  are  allowed  to  implement  the  project","during  official  working  hours  and  allowed  to  use  the  university  facilities.  A  certain                          amount of the project’s fund is given to the University.                 Article 5.

Preparation  of  the  research                          proposal can be initiated by the Research Center when external funding agencies or                         private institutions call for submission of proposals or when other agencies ask for help                         on certain issues that necessitates research investigation. The Research Center may                         seek the help of researchers in the University in the preparation of the proposals as                         well as external experts.                                The Research Center also calls for submission of proposals for funding by the                          University under the CRCG, and RRG. Proposals then undergo an evaluation process.                         In  the  event  that  proposals  are  qualified  for  funding  by  an  external  agency,  the                         proponent can then choose a preferred funding institution.                                The proposal submitted may be a research activity of the College where the                         researcher belongs to or it could be a collaborative undertaking involving other units in                         the University or elsewhere. At any rate, these activities must be coordinated with the                          Research Center to ensure that the proposals are in line with the University’s research                         agenda.                                The proponents shall submit research proposals using the prescribed format                         (with attachments). All proposals submitted for internal funding should be endorsed by                         the College/Campus Dean or Unit Head. Prior to submission, all proposals should have                         been pre-evaluated by the proponent using the Evaluation Checklist of Harmonized                         Gender  and  Development  Guidelines  (HGDG)  for  Program/Project  Development.

It  requires  the                                  process  of  anticipation  and  analysis  of  a  broad  range  of                                  socio-cultural,  technical,  economic,  environmental  and                                  political/legal  impact  prior  to  the  introduction  of  a  given                                  technology  or  even  while  a  specific  technology  is  being                                  promoted.    The  success  of  the  technology  assessment                                  depends on the efficient gathering and synthesis of adequate                                  information.  The TAP, which was developed by PCARRD in                                  2000,  embodies  some  recent  innovations  in  technology                                  assessment  procedures  and  processes.    The  processes  are                                  facilitated by the use of a gap identification tool called Quick                                  Resources Appraisal (QRA), and an intervention identification                                  tool - the Risk Management Process (RMP).  The TAP aims to                                  increase the level of confidence of the R \& D community on                                  the technologies it will promote and transfer.                                           A  pre-requisite  to  the  application  of  TAP  is  the                                  organization  of  an  interdisciplinary  team  composed  of  at                                  least  five  (5)  members  with  two  basic  expertise  that  are                                  critically needed:  a technically competent expert who knows                                  the  technology  and  the  commodity  being  assessed  and  an                                  economist with capabilities in financial analysis.

Techno  guides  have  to  be  appropriately  generated  through                               research.                           7.  The  University  Techno  guides  have  to  be  prepared  and                               published.                           8.  The research leaders have to supervise and manage the funds                               allocated for their approved research proposal.                           9.  The procurement of supplies, materials and equipment shall be                               coordinated with the Property Custodian and Supply Officer of                               the center.                           10.    Full  time  faculty  researchers  should  hold  office  in  the                               Research  Center.

Mechanics of Implementation                          1.  The  workload  system  applies  to  all  faculty  members  who  are                           involved in R \& E activities either full-time or part-time.                          2. For purposes of workload credit, the assigned task external to the                           university  shall  be  covered  by  a  Memorandum  of  Agreement                           between the University and the partner Agency or a Special Order                           from the office of the University President.                          3.  A faculty member shall have a minimum of 18 credit units in R \&                           E to be classified full-time researcher/extensions.                                                                                                        263","CvSU MANUAL OF OPERATIONS                    _____________________________________________________________________                                                                                                             264                        4.  A full-time faculty member shall be entitled to workload credit in R                           \& E only if he/she has satisfied the minimum workload of 18 credit                           units in teaching and R \& E work.                          5.  A program leader who is a project leader and a study leader in the                           same program shall only be credited once whichever has the higher                           credit units.                         6. Overload pay shall be given to faculty researchers whose total credit                           units is beyond 25 units                         7.  Faculty  member  with  external  activity  to  R\&E  and  has  received                           honorarium for such activity shall not be given credit units                          8.  All claims for credit units shall be supported by proper documents.                         9. Credit units as researcher/extensions shall only be claimed for the                           period specified in the program/project study activity as approved.                         10.  Workload  accreditation  of  other  R\&E  activities  not  covered  by                             these  guidelines  shall  be  referred  to  the  Office  of  the  Vice                             President  for  Research  \&  Extension  for  consideration  upon  the                             approval of the President.                         11. The rate of overload pay or honorarium is similar to those on full                             time    teaching.                         12. The funds for the overload shall come from the R \& E allocation or                             from other sources which the University deems appropriate.                             Honorarium                                   Honorarium is a form of remuneration granted to researchers                           for services rendered beyond the minimum/regular workload.  It is                           a  form  of  incentive  granted  for  the  services  of  officials/employees                           on special assignment.   For this purpose, a special assignment is                           an  undertaking  by  an  individual  or  a  composite  group  of                           officials/employees,  which  is  beyond  their  regular  and  primary                           functions.                                                                                                                         264","CvSU MANUAL OF OPERATIONS                    _____________________________________________________________________                                                                                                             265                           Types of Honoraria                                   Those  paid  to  a  government  official  or  employee  or  private                           individual who is requested to speak, lecture, or act as a resource                           person in seminars, workshops, conferences,  symposia, trainings,                           or classroom sessions (AMMRO, Book I as cited by UPLB Research                           Manual, 2002)                                   Those paid to a government official or employee by another                           office in which he/she is on detail or special assignment provided                           that  if  he/she  is  already  collecting  similar  compensation  or                           allowance for the same service or period for which payment is being                           claimed he/she may only choose to collect whichever is higher but                           in  no  case  shall  he/she  receive  both  (UPLB  Research  Manual,                           2002)                                   Those  paid  to  a  government  official/employee  or  private                           individual  for  his  membership  in  or  special  assignment  to                           committees or special projects.

Monitoring and evaluation                             Research Projects                                    The  research  projects  are  monitored  in  two  ways:  (1)  the                           financial and (2) the technical aspects.                                    The  accounting  department  of  the  University  monitors  and                           audits  the  financial  status  of  the  research  funds.  However,  the                           Special  Budget  Officer  of  the  Research  Center  records  every                           disbursement  for  each  research  project/unit  and  annotates  the                           Purchase Request Forms to indicate availability of funds and from                           which funds the purchases are to be credited.                                   The  Office  of  the  Director  of  Research  serves  as  the                           monitoring  and  coordinating  arm  for  all  researches  in  the                           University.    Although  research  activities  are  independently                           undertaken  by  the  different  colleges,  faculty  researchers  are  still                           required  to  submit  quarterly  progress  reports  on  their  research                           projects/studies.  The researchers submit their progress reports to                           their  respective  Deans  concerned,  which  in  turn  endorses  the                           progress  reports  to  the  Office  of  the  Director.  This  enables  the                                                                                                        265","CvSU MANUAL OF OPERATIONS                    _____________________________________________________________________                                                                                                             266                           Research  Center  to  keep  track  of  ongoing  projects  for  monitoring                           and evaluation as well as workload compensation purposes.                                The technical reports are submitted by the project proponent to                           the Monitoring and Evaluation Unit of the Research Center.

It involves the evaluation of all researches that are either                           completed  or  ongoing  during  the  particular  year  under  review.                           During these reviews, researchers present the progress/highlights                           of  their  researches.
