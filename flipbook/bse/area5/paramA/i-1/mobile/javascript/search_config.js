TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION            Introduction:              Curriculum, instruction, and assessment are the three essential components                              of an education system, whether online or face to face (Orlando, 2011).  These three                              components  must  be  equally  strengthen  for  a  successful  teaching  and  learning                              process.  To achieve desired learning outcomes, successful integration of content and                              meaningful assessment with effective pedagogy is necessary (Roth, 2017).  In the                              advent of COVID-19 pandemic, Philippine higher education institutions (HEIs) have                              explored  and  shifted  to  other  innovative  learning  modalities  that  transmigrate  the                              conduct  of  classes  from  traditional  or  face-to-face  to  flexible  learning  modalities.                              During these critical times, the development of coherent and cohesive curriculum is                              seemingly  overwhelming,  even  to  experienced  teachers.  Crizaldo,  Fabregar,  and                              Alitagtag  (2020)  recommended  ten  priority  areas  to  consider  in  the  successful                              implementation of flexible learning in the new normal; student competency being the                              most crucial.  In the delivery of flexible learning, students and faculty are expected to                              redesign a teaching-learning experience adaptive of the new normal so that optimum                              results can be achieved.                                      As assessment stimulates learner's attitudes and behaviors towards learning                              a  certain  competency,  it  must  be  constructively  aligned  with  the  curriculum  and                              instruction. Its results must be communicated to the learners to keep an eye on the                              progress  of  attaining  targets  so  that  appropriate  intervention  could  be  done  if                              necessary.  However, in most (if not all) cases, teachers and administrators are often                              concerned about what to teach and how to teach such content, leaving behind the                              assessment component.  As a result, the assessment component is often to be the                              weakest  of  the  three,  the  least  understood  and  the  least  effectively  implemented.                              Assessment protocols are seemingly important to be integrated into curriculum if a                              well-established  degree  of  success  in  reaching  the  desired  learning  outcomes  is                              desired.  Understanding by Design (UbD) by Grant Wiggins and Jay McTighe provides                              a framework that systematically addresses these key issues in a practical manner.                                      Guided  by  the  UbD  framework,  this  research  will  help  determine  specific                              knowledge  and  skills  to  be  assessed  in  a  particular  discipline  in  flexible  learning                              environment, including evidences of understanding and effective tools that best match                              in attaining these competencies.  Furthermore, instruction will be so designed to equip                              students  to  best  meet  these  knowledge  and  skills.    An  assessment  guide  will  be                              developed based on these elements.            Objectives:               Assessment is done primarily on boosting student learning and development,                              and rather than merely according grades.  It affords learners an opportunity to reflect                              on their performance and determine the extent of their progression towards achieving                              learning targets with the aid of teacher's feedback.  When learning institutions engage                              in  particular  instructional  strategies,  they  will  in  fact  be  trying  to  align  learning                              outcomes with certain assessment methodologies.  However, due to a number of key                              variables affecting the effectiveness of assessment in education, learning outcomes                              are often assessed several times with no rationale.  Thus, this study will be conducted                              to determine assessment strategies that could improve student's learning in the new                              normal  classroom  set  up.

TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION            Procedure/         Conceptual Framework of the study           Methodology                                     The  Input-Process-Output  model  will  be  used  to  illustrate  the  major                              components of this study.                                     The input is composed of the learning targets (specific knowledge and skills),                              assessment tools, evidence of learning (or understanding) and learning activities.                                     The process involves an analysis of the input in order to come up with the                              desired  output  of  the  study.  This  research  project  rests  on  the  Understanding  by                              Design® framework (UbD™ framework) developed by Wiggins, G., \& McTighe, J.                              (1998). It offers a planning process which aims to structure curriculum, assessment,                              and  instruction  which  1)  focus  on  teaching  and  assessing  for  understanding  and                              learning transfer, and 2) design curriculum  \"backward\" from those ends. The UbD                              framework offers a three-stage backward design process for curriculum planning.                                     The output is the assessment guide that will be proposed to assist educators                              in determining effective assessment tools used in flexible learning.  Along this line, an                              assessment guide will be developed and designed to further provide  alignment of                              assessment to curriculum and instruction.                                                                             Figure 1.  Research Concept Frame                                      The Understanding by Design framework is described as follows:                                     Stage 1: Identify desired results focuses on identifying the enduring concepts                              and  desired  student  outcomes  before  outlining  specifics  of  the  content.  Enduring                              concepts  are  important  ideas  or  core  processes  that  are  transferable  to  new                              situations, have lasting value beyond the classroom, are at the heart of the discipline,                              and are often abstract, counterintuitive, and misunderstood. What should students                              know,  understand,  and  be  able  to  do?  What  is  worthy  of  understanding?  This                              approach avoids two critical errors in teaching: textbook coverage or teaching for rote                              memorization  and activity-based  teaching  that  may  be  engaging  but  has  no  clear                              priorities.  Ideas  are  provided  for  differentiating  enduring  understandings  from  the                              knowledge and skills supporting those understandings and from second-level skills or                              factual knowledge.                                     Stage  2:  Determine  acceptable  evidence concentrates  on  the  variety  and                              depth of assessment tasks that are needed to validate that the student has achieved                              the  desired  enduring  understanding.  How  will  a  teacher  know  if  students  have                              achieved the desired results? Students reveal understanding when they participate in                              complex,  authentic  opportunities  to  engage  in  the  six  facets  of  understanding                              identified by Wiggins and McTighe:                                        •  Explanation provides thorough, supported, and justified accounts of                                            phenomena, facts, and data.","B.  TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION                                         •  Interpretation is designed to personalize information, contributing to                                            relevancy and long-term retention.                                        •  Application provides opportunities to utilize and apply understanding                                            in diverse contexts.                                        •  Perspective sees points of view through critical eyes and ears, the big                                            picture.                                        •  Empathy finds value in what others might find odd, alien, or                                            implausible; i.e., to perceive sensitively on the basis of prior direct                                            experience.                                        •  Self-knowledge recognizes that personal style, prejudices,                                            projections, and habits of mind shape and impede one's own                                            understanding.                                     Meaningful assessment requires a variety of tools, including informal checks                              in  class,  observation  and  student  dialogue,  formal  quizzes  and  tests,  academic                              prompts,  and  open-ended  assessment  tasks.  GRASPS  (goal,  role,  audience,                              situation, product or performance, standards for success) is provided as a prompt for                              the teacher in constructing quality performance tasks scenarios. UbD then embarks                              on an in-depth discussion of designing appropriate scoring rubrics. Effective rubrics                              relate specific task requirements to more general performance goals, discriminate                              among different degrees of understanding or proficiency, do not combine independent                              criteria, and include all potential performance outcomes differentiating from novice to                              expert. The more open-ended the assessment tasks, the more essential a strong                              rubric becomes.                                     Stage  3:  Plan  learning  experiences  and  instruction occurs  when  enduring                              understandings and appropriate evidence of understanding culminate in an effective                              instructional activity. It is often the case that assessment in the classroom begins with                              stage 3, where a teacher's favorite activity is conducted in class without consideration                              of expected outcome or adequate assessment. The backward design process flips                              from starting at stage 3 to beginning at stage 1 and moving to stage 3. The driving                              factor  is  the  enduring  concept,  not  the  activity.  Stage  3  essentially  asks,  \"What                              activities will equip students with the desired knowledge and skills?\" This requires the                              teacher to consider the intersection of engaging tasks and effective tasks. Activities                              at this intersection motivate students to explore understandings and misconceptions.                                     The sieve for activity design is called  WHERE. How will you help students                              know  Where  they  are  headed  and Why?  How  will  you Hook  students  through                              engaging and thought-provoking experiences? What events, real or simulated, can                              students Experience to make the ideas and issues real? What learning activities will                              help students to Explore the big ideas and essential questions? What instruction is                              needed to Equip students for the final performance? How will you cause students                              to Reflect and Rethink to dig deeper into the core ideas? How will you guide students                              in Rehearsing, Revising,  and Refining  their  work  based  on  feedback  and  self-                              assessment?  How  will  students Exhibit  their  understanding  about  their  final                              performances and products? How will you guide them in self-Evaluation to identify the                              strengths and weaknesses in their own work and set future goals?                                     A key concept in UbD framework is alignment – all three stages must clearly                              align  not  only  to standards,  but also  to one another.  In  other  words,  the  Stage 1                              content and understanding must be what is assessed in Stage 2 and taught in Stage                              3. The research process is resembled in Figure 1, where the UbD is used as the main                              framework.","B.

The descriptive nature of this research will be                                 used  to  understand  and  describe  the  assessment  strategies  used  in  flexible                                 learning  environment  in  the  new  normal.    The  evaluative  component  of  the                                 research design will be used to measure the effectiveness of these strategies,                                 especially in attaining learning targets and designing learning activities.                              c.  Sampling Procedure                                        Purposive sampling will be used in selecting CvSU faculty participants to                                 this study.  Those faculty members with less than a year of teaching experience                                 will  be  removed  from  the  list  since  they  are  yet  to  have  experienced  some                                 assessment strategies, both in the face-to-face and in the new normal.                              d.  Data Collection Procedure                                        Study 1-5.  Data will be collected among the participants through online                                 surveys  and  focus  group  discussion.  There  will  be  three  sets  of  research                                 instruments to be used in this study. The first instrument contains the modalities                                 and tools used in assessing student's learning in the new normal and this has two                                 versions: one for the student and one for the instructor/professor.                                        The second instrument is the interview protocol that will be used during the                                 focus  group  discussion.    It  is  intended  for  interview  of  selected  students  and                                 instructor/professors involved in the study.                                        Finally, a Virtual Classroom Assessment Observation Protocol is prepared                                 to  determine  the  detailed  assessment  used  by  each  faculty  member  in  their                                 course/s handled.                                        Sample  assessment  activities/outputs  such  as,  but  not  limited  to,                                 examinations with TOS, rubrics, performance tasks, written tasks, portfolio, and                                 self-report, will be collected from the students and instructor/professors.                                        Data that will be gathered in Studies 1-5 will be used to formulate flexible                                 learning assessment framework that any educator can be used in the new normal.                                 Using  this  proposed  framework,  an  assessment  guide  will  be  designed  and                                 developed  that  will  further  assist  educators  in  effectively  aligning  curriculum,                                 instruction and assessment. The developed assessment guide will be validated by                                 three experts before it could finally be used.                                         Study 6. The developed assessment guide will be introduced to faculty                                 members in the CvSU system through series of webinar and trainings before the                                 start of the semester of AY 2022 – 2023.  Its acceptability will be determined.  A                                 rating  system  will  be  used  to  evaluate  the  developed  assessment  guide  on                                 assessment  of  learning  in  the new normal.    This  is  intended  for  evaluation  by                                 students, instructor/professor, and experts.                                         Prior  to  the  actual  distribution  of  the  instrument,  the  developed                                 questionnaires will be pre-tested to selected students and some faculty members","B.  TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION                                  who were not part of the study to determine its validity and reliability.  Once validity                                 and reliability are established, this will be sent to the students and faculty members                                 involved in the study.  An online form of these questionnaires will be prepared to                                 reduce the cost of transportation and reproduction of research instruments.                              e.  Data Analysis                                       The  developed  questionnaires  will  be  subjected  to  validation  by  some                                 experts in the field. Cohen's Kappa coefficient will be used to measure the inter-                                 rater reliability or agreement between two or more experts to assess the validity of                                 these documents.                                       All  data  to  be  gathered  will  be  tabulated  and  analyzed  accordingly.                                 Descriptive statistics such as, but not limited to, frequency counts, ranks, means,                                 and percentages, will be used to describe the primary data that will be collected                                 among the graduates and employers. The data will be treated and analyzed using                                 appropriate  statistical  tests  with  the  aid  of  the  Statistical  Packages  for  Social                                 Sciences v. 22.

Monitoring and evaluation                                        As  part  of  monitoring  activities,  quarterly  meeting  and  report  will  be                                 conducted and submitted.  This is to ensure that every activity is implemented as                                 planned and every problem encountered is resolved.                              g.  Ethical Considerations                                        Informed consent from the university president and campus administrators                                 will be obtained using relevant documentation before the conduct of the study.                                 These documents will include informed invitation letters to conduct the research                                 at the university and its campuses, informed invitation letters to participants and                                 the learners for their participation.                               To protect their basic rights, privacy, and confidentiality, all direct identifiers will be                                   removed.  Before and during the transcriptions of the observed lessons, all                               participants will be given fictive names, as well as with the pre-service teacher and                               school.  This is an important step that none of the participants will be recognizable.                                 Data will be filed in separate secure locations to protect all participants against                                indirect identification.

TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION           Rationale:                                   Employability  is  more  than  merely  getting  a  job  but  implies  a  set  of                            achievement  in  terms  of  skills,  understandings  and  personal  attributes.  Developing                            competent graduates whose skills and capabilities can readily respond to the dynamic                            needs of the industry is a vital role of higher education institutions (HEIs).  HEIs are                            challenged  to  evaluate  their  curriculum  to  ensure  the  fit  between  graduate                            competencies  and  those  required  by  employers,  stressing  on  specific  and  well-                            targeted  skills  to  guarantee  an  effective job market placement  of  its  graduates.   In                            addition, Javier (2018) reiterated that graduates should have gained the appropriate                            competencies  and  skills  in  their  field  of  specialization  upon  graduation  and  before                            applying to the workplace of their choice.                                    One  way  of  evaluating  the  results  of  education  and  training  provided  in  the                            HEIs is the conduct of a graduate tracer study.  It is an efficient mechanism to monitor                            graduates’  employability,  evaluate  their  workplace  performance,  and  establish  the                            effectiveness  and  responsiveness  of  curricular  programs  offered  in  any  HEI.    Data                            generated  from  the  tracer  study  could  re-evaluate  the  factors  affecting  and                            contributing to the status of employment of graduates.                                    Cavite State University – Tanza Campus, being a primary tertiary education in                            the municipality of Tanza, Cavite, aims to ensure that graduates of the campus have                            extensive  education  and  training  for  them  to  be  equipped  with  competencies,                            knowledge and skills in their field of study and be prepared to become part of their                            chosen industry.  In order for the campus to monitor its graduates on a periodic basis,                            the conduct  of  tracer study  is necessary.    Hence,  a  graduate  tracer study  is  being                            proposed  to  determine  the  workplace  performance  of  CvSU  –  Tanza  Campus                            graduates.  Consequently,  the  study  could  provide  insights  about  the  level  of                            workplace  preparedness  and  attitude  of  its  graduates  as  well  as  the  employers’                            satisfaction  on  the  workplace  performance  and  attitudes.  In  addition,  the  study  will                            also determine the relevance and responsiveness of CvSU – TC curricular programs                            to the needs of the industry based on its graduates’ quality of performance. Moreover,                            the  results  of  the  findings  will  serve  as  significant  inputs  to  the  curriculum                            development of the University to meet local and global demands for a highly skilled                            labor force.             Objectives:               The industry relies so much on higher education institutions in training and                            preparing graduates for the workplace.  Due to this, higher education institutions find                            ways to make their curriculum responsive to the needs of the industry. Cavite State                            University – Tanza finds it crucial to ensure that effective and efficient programs are                            provided  to  produce  a  human  workforce  capable  of  contributing  to  national                            development.  Thus,  this  study  will  be  conducted  to  determine  the  workplace                            performance  of  CvSU  –  Tanza  graduates.  Furthermore,  it  also  aims  to  develop  a                            graduate tracer mobile application and information system that can be used by the                            office of student affairs and services to find required alumni data which can be used                            for accreditation and other purposes.                                    The  four  component  studies  are  specifically  done  to  obtain  answers  to  the                            following objectives:                             Study 1.

Fleming et al. (2009) conducted a study among                                industrial supervisors, students and graduates, who rated 24 competencies. They                                found that ‘ability and willingness to learn’, ‘initiative’ and ‘personal planning and                                organizational skills’ bore the highest ratings among the competencies students                                needed  to  master  before  starting  their  cooperative  educational  experiences.  In                                response  to  a  survey  of  employers  conducted  in  Scotland,  ‘trustworthiness’,                                ‘reliability’,  ‘motivation’,  ‘communication  skills’  and  ‘willingness  to  learn’  were                                considered  the  most  important  transferable  skills  when  hiring  graduates                                (McMurray et al., 2016).                                       According to Abas and Imam in 2016, one critical measure of success in                                workplaces is an employee’s ability to use competently the knowledge, skills and                                values that match the needs of his job, satisfy the demands of his employer, and                                contribute to the overall achievement of institutional goals.                                 Employers’ views on graduate competencies                                       Deaconu  et  al.  (2014)  reported  that  employers  were  most  satisfied  with                                graduates’  abilities  in  ‘assuming  responsibility’,  ‘efficient  activity  planning  and                                organization’  and  ‘promptness  and  efficient  time  management’.  The  results  of                                content-analysed  data  collected  through  critical  incident  interviews  on                                competencies by Ryan et al. (2012) indicate that the presence of skills in ‘team                                leadership’,  ‘achievement  orientation’,  ‘developing  others’  and  ‘impact  and                                influence on others’ predicts business profitability.                                       Employers  require  graduates  to  have  the  fundamental  technical  skills                                necessary for their specific professions (Low et al., 2016). However, beyond that,                                studies  have  found  that  soft  skills  have  been  receiving  greater  attention  in                                organizations (Stewart et al., 2016) and higher education (Pang and Hung, 2012).                                Based on data gathered from job advertisements placed in the careers section of                                newspapers, Dunbar et al. (2016) found that employers placed greatest emphasis                                on soft skills and discussed technical skills to a lesser extent. Further supporting                                this hypothesis, an online survey conducted in the United Kingdom concluded that                                human  resource  professionals  were  very  impressed  with  graduates’  technical                                skills, but expressed concerns about their soft skills and attributes (Poon, 2014). A                                study  soliciting  comments  from  the  Romanian  labour  market  revealed  that                                employers viewed transversal competencies as more important than professional                                ones (Deaconu et al., 2014). In a study surveying 143 organizations, Jackson and                                Chapman (2012) found that students were confident and proficient on technical                                aspects but significantly deficient in managerial skill sets.                                 Current conceptualizations of graduate work readiness                                       The evident lack of clarity and consensus on what defines work readiness                                may be due to the fact  that, as  a  construct, it  is  still  in  the  early  stages  of                                development.    The  emergence  of interest  in work  readiness can  be  linked  to                                the  increasing  demand  from  employers  for graduates to possess a diverse                                range of generic graduate attributes or generic skills (Hager \&  Holland,  2006).                                This    trend    has    resulted    from   economic    and    technological    developments                                which  have  significantly  changed  the  nature  of  the  workplace.    The  term                                generic    skills    is  used    interchangeably    with    related    terms    including    “core                                skills”,  “basic  skills”,  “transferable skills”  and  “employability  skills”.    It  refers                                to  a  range  of  qualities  and  capacities  that  are viewed as important in the                                preparation  for  work  in  almost  any  job.    Examples  of  generic  skills  include                                communication, problem solving and working with others.   Alternatively,  Hager                                and Holland  argue  that  generic  graduate attributes  go  beyond  technical  skills                                to  also  include attitudes,  values  and  dispositions.   The various combinations of                                attributes and skills that a graduate applies in different contexts can be referred to                                as capabilities (Hager, 2006).  Consistent  with  the interchangeable terms used                                                                                                V01-2018-05-30","9                                 to  describe generic  skills  and  attributes, different  labels  are also used in  the                                literature  to    describe    the    notion    of  work    readiness  including    “work                                preparedness”,    “graduate    employability”,    “transferable    skills”    and    “generic                                attributes”.                                       The findings by Carless (2007) in particular, provide some useful insight                                into the practices of Australian   organizations.    The   most   common   methods                                used   by   the   50   Australian organizations  surveyed,  in  order  of  popularity                                were,  application  forms,  interviews,  cognitive ability  tests,  personality  tests                                and    assessment  centers.    These  selection  methods    are    each  designed    to                                predict    different    dimensions    of    performance    criteria,    however,    not    all                                methods  are  employed  in  the  same  selection  process.    According  to  Carless,                                while  more  than  half  of  the  Australian      organizations      utilized      a      selection                                battery   comprising three   methods: application forms, interviews and one other                                selection method of choice, 42% indicated they only used application forms and                                interviews to select graduate applicants. Although  these methods  have  been                                shown  to  demonstrate  validity  across  occupational  groups  and  in various                                contexts,  it  is  less  clear  how  effective  they  are  in  assessing  potential  in                                graduate applicants.  In particular the fact that some organizations only rely on the                                use of application forms  and  interviews  raises  concerns  about  the  ability  of                                current  assessment  methods  in being able to examine graduate work readiness                                as a construct in itself.                                       Mintz (2019) enumerated concerns about career readiness of graduates. It                                is  said  that  college  education  is  “excessively  theoretical  and  disconnected  from                                [the]  real  world”.  Also,  students  are  said  to  be  lack  of  necessary  skills  and                                experience  that  the  employers  are  looking  for  and  lack  of  “realistic  career                                aspirations” or plan to fulfill their goals. In a 2017 survey conducted by Gallup and                                Strada  (as  cited  by  Mintz,  2019),  only  a  third  of  32,000  college  students  they                                asked  are  confident  that  they  will  graduate  with  the  necessary  skills  and                                knowledge that the employers are seeking and only half of them think that they                                will  have  a  good  job  with  their  major.  In  addition,  less  than  half  of  the  recent                                college  graduates  were  competent  in  oral  and  written  communication  and  only                                56% excel in critical thinking and problem solving based on a survey conducted                                by the National Association of Colleges and Employers (as cited by Mintz, 2019).                                He wrote that universities can better prepare students by providing students and                                faculties insights about employment trends, outcomes, and earnings. They should                                also  embed  career  exploration,  align  curricula  with  workforce  outcomes,  and                                connect students with alumni and employers.                                 Employability Skills Framework                                              Jackson  and  Chapman’s  (2011)  framework  of  20  skills,  broadly                                considered to represent typical industry skill requirements of business graduates.                                Jackson  and  Chapman’s  own  framework  derived  from  an  extensive  review  of                                employer-based studies on industry-relevant skill requirements in undergraduates.                                To  measure  the  perception  of  graduates  on  their  preparedness,  satisfaction  of                                employers on the employment performance of the graduates, and to characterize                                graduates’  workplace  performance  as  perceived  by  employers,  the  proposed                                study will adapt the skills framework from the instrument used by Jackson et. al, in                                2013  in  their  study.  These  are;  effective;  communication  skills  self-awareness;                                critical  thinking  skills;  data  analyzing  skills  and  use  of  technology;  problem-                                solving; working effectively with others; initiative and enterprise development; self-                                management ;social responsibility; professionalism.                                 Employers’ satisfaction on the work attitudes of graduates                                           Plantilla in 2017, used ten personal qualities to measure the satisfaction of                                employers to the attitude of the graduates, these are; 1.) Flexibility (responds well                                                                                                  V01-2018-05-30","10                                 to  change,  2.)  Creativity  (identifies  new  approaches  to  problem),  3.)  Empathy                                (understands the situations, feelings, or motives of others), 4.) Reliability (can be                                depended  on  to  complete  work  assignments),  5.)  Integrity  (understands  and                                applies  ethical  principles  to  decisions),  6.)  Self-discipline  (exhibits  control  of                                personal  behavior),  7.)  Work  Optimism  (positive  attitude  toward  work.),  8.)                                Enthusiasm  (willingness  to  learn),  9.)  Compliance  (understands  and  takes                                directions  for  work  assignments),  and 10.)  Accountability  (accepts  responsibility                                for  consequences  of  actions).  These  will  also  be  adapted  to  measure  work                                attitude perceived by graduates and to measure the satisfaction of employers to                                the work performance and attitudes of the graduates.                                          As  a  result  on  his  study,  employers  were  extremely  satisfied  with  the                                personal qualities exhibited by the graduates in workplace. They were extremely                                satisfied with the graduates on their willingness to learn, positive attitude towards                                work  responsibility  and  ability  to  take  directions  and  assignments.  Employers                                considered  all  the  stated  personal  qualities  as  extremely  important  for  the                                employees  to  successfully  perform  their  job.  They  put  much  premium  on  self-                                discipline,  positive  attitude  towards  work  and  willingness  to  learn  as  important                                qualities  of  an  employee.  These  personal  qualities  should  emanate  to  the                                graduates for them to be hired in their jobs.                                 Relevance and Responsiveness of curricular program in the Philippines                                           Curriculum is a broad set of experiences that students go through during                                the entire time they are in school. The curriculum is generally considered as the                                complete  course  path  that  will  enable  students  to  attain  the  goals  and  general                                objectives of education. It is the learner‘s engagement with various aspects of the                                environment, which is under the direction of the school. Curriculum empowers all                                students  and  motivates  them  towards  lifelong  learning.  But  because  of                                technological  advancements,  the  spread  of  new  information  media  and  the                                predominance of software and hardware devices, a school‘s curriculum should be                                enhanced.  It  should  be  pragmatic  to  meet  the  needs  of  society  and  should                                conform to the actualities of the community. A school‘s curriculum should be re-                                structured  with  a  likely  shift  towards  a  more  meaningful  course  of  study.  It  is                                indeed very important for an educational institution to have a balanced and well-                                designed curriculum for all the programs it offers. In doing so, the institution shall                                have a more stable system in undertaking its goals and mission so as to make its                                curricular programs efficient and effective to its major concern – the students.                                          Central to the realization of an institution‘s goal is continuity and innovation                                anchored on a relevant curriculum. Change in strategies, in the course contents,                                in  methodologies  for  teaching,  is  well  recognized  as  sensitive,  difficult  and                                sometimes,  impossible,  so  much  so  that  the  acceptance  of  the  status  quo  is                                pervasive.  There  is  a  great  belief  that  if  a  plan  is  well  planned  and  based  on                                logical theories and goals; there is nothing that will prevent it from being initiated.                                Yet, it will also be noted that a quite a number of elaborately planned innovations                                and  curricular  changes  have  floundered  on  the  threshold  of  the  bureaucratic                                organization (Hagos \& Dejarme, 2008).                                 From  Curriculum  to  Career:  Connecting  Curriculum  Outcomes  to  Future                                Careers                                           Students often arrive at university level instruction with some idea of                                their future employment direction. It is important for university instructors to                                seize their student’s career enthusiasm and foster a connection between the                                curriculum  and  potential  future  career  applications.  Providing  students  with                                an  opportunity  to  connect  their  classroom  learning,  (online  or  face-to-face)                                with workplace relevance will result in many positive learning outcomes such                                as  motivation,  grit,  and  career  goal  setting.  As  stated  by  Schwartz,  Gregg,                                                                                                  V01-2018-05-30","11                                 and McKee (2018) “Guidance and information focused on careers should be                                included  throughout  one’s  undergraduate  experience”  (p.  51).  To  integrate                                career  content  into  the  classroom  the  following  tips  are  suggested:                                integrating  career  focused  topics  in  discussions  and  activities;  using  and                                integrating  services  offered  by  career  resource  centers;  including  guest                                speakers;  and  incorporating  additional  online  career  resources.  These                                strategies help foster a connection between course material and professions                                and careers students may be considering.                                           Instructors have the unique opportunity to help students explore future                                career  opportunities.  Research  has  shown  the  importance  of  providing                                college-level students with the skills needed to explore career opportunities.                                University  students  need  to  be  exposed  to  career  exploration  in  their  early                                coursework,  via  classroom  discussions,  university  career  resources  and                                online  career  sites,  and  real-world  speakers.  Career  education  is  a  lifelong                                learning  experience  that  needs  to  have  a  greater  focus,  from  the  first                                semester through the last, for all university students (Levin \& Mudd, 2018).                                  Mobile Application Development                                            In the modern age of Information and communication system, people                                are  habituated  to  use  computer  and  computer  application.  But  Mobile                                Application uses and development is a new and rapidly growing sector. There                                is  a  global  positive  impact  of  mobile  application.  Using  mobile  application                                developed country are becoming facilitate and people, society of developing                                country  are  upgrading  themselves  and  making  a  new  type  of  IT                                infrastructure.  Mobile  applications are running on  a small  hand  hold mobile                                device  which  is  moveable,  easy  to  use  and  accessible  from  anywhere  and                                any  place.  Now  a  day,  so  many  people  are  using  mobile  application  to                                contact friends, browse internet, file content management, document creating                                and  handling,  entertainment  etc.  From  everywhere  user  can  get  facility  of                                mobile application. People can do many things of his daily life and business                                life. Not only the mobile application has an impact for user but also it plays                                an  important  role  in  business.  Many  business  companies  are  earning                                revenue using mobile  application.  The  mobile  application has  an  impact on                                society.  The mobile application  run  in a mobile environment  which usability                                depends on several factors such as: Screen resolution, Hardware limitations,                                Expensive Data Usage, Connectivity issues, Limited Interaction possibilities.                                Last few years the mobile companies are trying to develop mobile device with                                more  screen  resolution,  more  storage,  better  connectivity  which  provide                                better environment for modern mobile application (Islam \& Mazumder, 2010).                                            Usability testing is a common tool used to evaluate the usability of a                                mobile  application  in  a  development  process.  Usability  tests  are  usually                                conducted using a think aloud protocol based on K. A. Ericsson and H. A. Simon’s                                work (1980, 1984). Users are given tasks in a test environment and encouraged                                to  think  aloud  while  trying  to  accomplish  the  tasks.  This  gives  usability                                practitioners, information they need on how the user interface matches the natural                                human way of thinking and acting and highlights the features and processes to be                                improved (Kaikkonen et. al.,2005).

Data Collection Procedure                                          There  will  be  two  questionnaires  to  be  used  in  this  study.    The  first                                   questionnaire,  The Workplace Preparedness  and Attitudes  Inventory  (please                                   see  Appendix  1),  has  three  parts  and  will  be  answered  by  the  CvSU  TC                                   Graduates.  The first part will determine the profile of CvSU TC graduates as                                   to their status, nature and area of employment.  The second part is expected                                   to determine the level  of workplace preparedness and attitudes of CvSU-TC                                   Graduates.    This  was  adapted  from  the  Employability  Skills  Framework  by                                   Jackson,  D.,  Sibson,  R.  \&  Riebe,  L.  (2013).  The  third  part  determines  the                                   graduates’ workplace attitudes using the ten personal qualities of employees                                   adapted  from  the  study  of  Plantilla  in  2017.The  fourth  part  determines  their                                   perception of relevance and responsiveness of their curricular program to their                                   current employment.                                          The  second  questionnaire,  The  Employer’s  Feedback  (please  see                                   Appendix 2), is intended for the employers of the CvSU-TC Graduates.  It has                                   three  parts.    The  first  part  contains  information  relative  to  the  employer’s                                   profile.  The second questionnaire determines their perception and satisfaction                                   towards  quality  of  workplace  performance  of  CvSU  TC  graduates  who  were                                   employed in their organization which was also adapted from the Employability                                   Skills  Framework  (Jackson,  et.al,  2013).      The  third  part  determines  their                                   perception  of  relevance  and  responsiveness  of  the  CvSU-TC  curricular                                   programs based on the workplace performance of the latter’s graduates.                                          The data that will be collected from the three studies will be utilized as                                   basis for graduate tracing mobile application development.                                          Prior  to  the  actual  distribution  of  the  instrument,  the  developed                                   questionnaire  will  be  pre-tested  to  selected  graduating  students  and  some                                   organization  leaders  who  were not part of  the study  to  determine  its validity                                   and reliability.  Once validity and reliability are established, this will be sent to                                   the  graduates  and  their  employers.    Simultaneously,  each  graduate  will  be                                   contacted through any communication forms available such as, but not limited                                   to,  texts,  social  media  sites,  and  emails.    An  online  form  (or  a  mobile                                   application)  of  these  questionnaires  will  be  prepared  to  reduce  the  cost  of                                                                                                  V01-2018-05-30","13                                    transportation and reproduction of research instruments.                                    D.  Data Analysis                                          The developed questionnaires will be subjected to validation by some                                    experts in the field.  Cohen’s Kappa coefficient will be used to measure the                                    inter-rater reliability or agreement between two or more experts to assess the                                    validity  of  these  documents.    On  the  other  hand,  Cronbach’s  alpha  will  be                                    used  to  determine  the  internal  consistency  of  the  constructs  used  in  the                                    survey when answered by a group of participants.                                          All  data  to  be  gathered  will  be  tabulated  and  analyzed  accordingly.                                    Descriptive  statistics  such  as,  but  not  limited  to,  frequency  counts,  ranks,                                    means, and percentages, will be used to describe the primary data that will be                                    collected among the graduates and employers.  Likert scales will be used to                                    describe  the  variables  in  this  study.    Furthermore,  correlation  tests  will  be                                    used to explore relationships among the variables involved in this study.  The                                    data will be analyzed using the Statistical Packages for Social Sciences v. 22.

Data were collected from a total of 262 teachers from public central elementary                schools,  who  were  selected  through  complete  enumeration  for  male  and  simple  random                 sampling for female.  Results showed that elementary teaching is still a female-dominated                profession  and  students  have  only  limited  encounters  with  male  and/or  father  figures  in                elementary education.  Higher participation rate in schools, a high level of retention and low                 incidence of dropout among girls are being observed than with boys.  Data collected on the                reproductive,  productive,  community  and  leisure  activities  show  that  these  were  equally                 divided  among  members  of  the  family.  However,  results  also  show  that  there  are                discrepancies in their uses of teaching strategies and female teachers spend more time in                productive activities than male teachers.  In terms of access to and control over resources,                 those resources which are usually used by men are controlled by male teachers (e.g., vehicle,                house repairs, etc.) while those which are usually used by women are mostly controlled by                female teachers (e.g, appliances, utilities in terms of water and electricity) as these refer to                 their functions as “mothers.”  Decision-making activities are dominated by both father and                mother.                  Introduction                         Gender equality is inextricably linked to the right to education as both male and female,                boys and girls, men and women experienced gender stereotypes in varied forms.  On one                 hand, girls and women are often discriminated against during education in terms of access,                completion, treatment, learning outcomes and career choices, leading to some disadvantages                that transcend schooling and also the school environment. Munhoz (2020) reveals that the                 presence of gender stereotypes in curricula, textbooks and teaching processes; the violence                they face in and out of school; and male dominance in certain academic and professional                 fields are factors that prevent girls from claiming and exercising their right to education on an                equal stands.  On the other hand, the inferiority of male elementary educators has evoked an                educational  culture  that  perceives  the  near  non-existence  of  male  primary  teachers  as  a                 common predicament among other basic education institutions.  The notion of male primary                school  teachers  being  temporary  positions  for  men  is  a  possible  injustice  in  elementary                 education.                         This suggests that educational institutions should function in ways that do not impose                 or  perpetuate  gender  stereotypes  that  exert  psychological  influence  and/or  promote                institutional barriers to the range of possibilities that boys and girls, men and women, can","enjoy in relation to the education being offered.  There has been an increased attention to the                importance of achieving gender equality in education. To date, however, most efforts have                 focused on addressing gender parity and aim to have an equal number or proportion of girls                and  boys  accessing  educational  opportunities.  Simple  gender  parity  may  be  easier  to                measure. On the other hand, gender equality, a wider concept of which gender parity is only                 a part, moves beyond access and requires that girls and boys also experience the same levels                of quality and outcomes of education.                          Teaching mirrors the common stereotypes of women and their supposed abilities. For                several years, there exist a discrepancy between the number of female and male teachers at                 the elementary level. Historically, females have dominated the profession of teaching at the                elementary level as teaching children in pre-elementary and elementary schools is traditionally                seen as an “extension to motherhood” and therefore a “natural” job for women (equality@ei-                 ie.org., 2015).  In 2019, female elementary teachers in the Philippines was reported at 87.35%                (World  Bank  Group,  2020).    One  might  conclude  that  this  deficit  would  result  in  an                 unacceptable imbalance in elementary teacher gender demographics.  The lack of balance                could lead to a difference in perceptions about female and male teachers.                          This conferred an idea to further pursue exploration about issues regarding gender                and development in the education sector.  Discussion on gender differences exist in almost                all  media  including  research  and  development;  however,  differences  between  female  and                 male elementary teachers in terms of their perceived gender roles, access to and control over                their resources have not been fully researched and analyzed. Seminars, trainings, and gender-                 responsive  programs  were  continuously  provided  in  the  education  sector,  augmenting  the                gender  awareness  of  teachers  into  becoming  gender-responsive  educators;  but  a  better                understanding of gender-based differences among elementary school teachers may lead to                 improvements in teacher education and professional development programs.                         As these assumptions reveal massive disadvantages for female educators and to fully                 understand the underrepresentation of male educators in the elementary level, a study on                gender-based differentiation among elementary educators in Cavite may serve as basis for                 gender-responsive policies and projects.                  Objectives                        To close the gap on the under-researched topic on differences between female and                 male elementary teachers in terms of their perceived gender roles, access to and control over                their resources, this study was conducted to determine the gender role differentiation among                 educators of Cavite.","Specifically, the study aimed to:                          1.  to characterize Public Elementary Schools in Cavite in terms of key performance                              indicators;                          2.  determine  the  gender  role  of  male  and  female  elementary  teachers  in                             reproductive,  productive,  community,  and  leisure  activities  while  identifying                              problems, needs and constraints in the performance of these activities;                          3.  determine access to and control over resources and benefits of male and female                              elementary teachers in the households and the community; and                          4.  recommend gender–responsive and gender-equality strategies that will address                             the identified problems, needs and constraints in terms of decision making.                  Conceptual Framework                         The study used the Input-Process-Output-Outcome Approach in order to come up with                 gender-based  policies,  strategies,  interventions,  recommendations,  and  analysis  in  the                education sector.                                                             The inputs considered were the institutional profiles, household profiles, triple roles,                 leisure activities, time devoted to triple roles and leisure activities, access to and control over                resources and benefits, and the problems, needs, and constraints encountered.  Based on                 these primary data, gender analysis was conducted to create sex-disaggregated data on the                household profiles and access to and control over resources and benefits; and differentiate                gender roles among secondary educators in general. Also, the identified problems, needs,","and constraints  among the participants served as bases for  policy formulation, strategies,                interventions,  and  recommendations  in  order  to  come  up  with  school-community  that  is                 gender-responsive.                  Review of Literature                         Gender Analysis.  Gender Analysis is the systematic gathering and examination of                information on gender differences and social relations in order to identify, understand and re-                 address inequities based on gender. Reeves and Baden (2000), stated that gender analysis                is a valuable descriptive and diagnostic tool for development planners and crucial to gender                mainstreaming efforts. The components and methodology of gender analysis are shaped by                 how gender issues are understood.                        The role of gender needs is very important in gender analysis. Shared and prioritized                needs identified by women that arise from their common experiences as a gender and some                 women’s interests, of a political or practical nature, related to their experience as a gendered                person. Prioritized concerns have been translated into the concept of gender needs (Moser,                1989).  This  identifies  the  way  in  which  women’s  gender  interests,  defined  by  women                 themselves,  can  be  satisfied  in  the  planning  process.  Although  needs  and  interests  are                conceptually different (Molyneux, 1998), in practice, they are closely related in the planning                 process.  Needs,  as  well  as  interests,  result  from  a  political  process  of  contestation  and                interpretation and thus should not be externally defined or seen as fixed.                        Needs for Gender Analysis. Practical Gender  Needs  (PGNs) according to Moser                 (1989) are the immediate needs identified by women to assist their survival in their socially                accepted  roles,  within  existing  power  structures.  Policies  to  meet  PGNs  tend  to  focus  on                 ensuring that women and their families have adequate living conditions, such as health care                and food provision, access to safe water and sanitation, but also seek to ensure access to                income-earning  opportunities.  PGNs  do  not  directly  challenge  gender  inequalities,  even                though  these  needs  may  be  a  direct  result  of  women’s  subordinate  position  in  society.                 Strategic gender needs (SGNs), are those needs identified by women that require strategies                for challenging male dominance and privilege. These needs may relate to inequalities in the                 gender division of labor, in ownership and control of resources, in participation in decision-                making, or to experiences of domestic and other sexual violence. These needs are often seen                as feminist in nature as they seek to change women’s status and position in society in relation                 to men. As such, they are more likely to be resisted than PGNs. In reality, it is difficult to                distinguish so clearly between strategic and practical needs. Any policy or program may meet                 both sets of needs. Through collective organizing around practical gender needs, women may                achieve more strategic and transformatory goals. This politicization of practical gender needs                is a favored entry point  for  NGOs and women’s organizations.  However, women may not","always recognize or prioritize their strategic gender needs, particularly if it could threaten their                immediate practical needs. At any time, gender interests may not be prioritized over women’s                 other  interests  which  cut  across  these,  such  as  those  of  class  and  race,  so  assumptions                cannot be made of women’s solidarity.                        Gender  Analysis  for  Education.  Gender  analysis  is  a  critical  step  in  the  gender                 mainstreaming  of  legislation,  policies  and  programmes  and,  in  turn,  in  achieving  gender                equality.  Gender  analysis  is  necessary  to  determine  the  existing  gender  balance,  and  to                 assess the way in which a policy or programme will impact women and men. According to                CIDA,  gender  analysis  “provides  an  understanding  of  the  different  impact  that  legislation,                cultural practices, policies and programs can have on women and men” (2007a). In fact, if a                 gender  analysis  is  not  conducted  during  the  design  of  a  policy  or  programme,  it  may                inadvertently increase current gender inequalities or lead to further gender inequalities (Status                 of Women Canada, 2007).                        Gender  analysis  reveals  differences  in  women’s  and  men’s  activities,  conditions,                needs, access to and control over resources and benefits, as well as decision‐making power                 (UNESCO,  2005).  Identifying  these  differences  can  help  policymakers  and  programme                managers understand why the differences exist and reveal entry points for designing policies                and  programmes  that  can  successfully  address  gender  disparities  and  challenge  deeply                 ingrained  systemic  inequalities  in  order  to  remove  or  reduce  these  obstacles  to  gender                equality.                        Girls’  education  is  an  “important  entry  point  to  begin  tackling  gender  inequality  in                 developing  countries”  (CIDA,  2003,  p.5).  Gender  equality  cannot  be  achieved  in  schools                without a focus on full and equal access to a good quality education for both boys and girls                 (UNESCO, 2000). While much progress has been made towards increasing female enrolment                in schooling, many girls still face cultural, societal and physical barriers to attending school.                Increasing girls’ access to education, however, does not necessarily lead to the promotion of                 gender  equality.  Longwe  notes  that  schools  are  institutions  founded  on  a  dominant  male                culture  and  they  can  advertently  or  inadvertently  perpetuate  societal  gender  inequalities                 through power relations within schools, pedagogy and portrayal of male and female roles in                textbook and learning materials (1998).                        Gender analysis can be integral to understanding the gender inequalities that currently                 exist and possible routes to removing and reducing them. It can bring to light areas where                improvements must be made, allowing practitioners and researchers to develop plans and                policies to meet the needs of their unique context. This process can be aided and scaffolded                 through the use of various frameworks.                        Gender  Analysis  Frameworks:  A  Comparative  Overview.  Gender  analysis                frameworks enable policymakers and practitioners to structure the application of research on","gender  and  conceptual  theory  into  gender‐sensitive  planning,  design,  implementation  and                 monitoring and evaluation of development and education interventions. The frameworks are                designed to ensure that gender needs and roles can be identified, addressed and monitored                (Leach, 2003). Although the most commonly used gender analysis frameworks were designed                 to address issues in the development sector more broadly, many have been modified recently                to meet the unique needs of the education field. In education, they have been particularly                useful to identify issues of gender bias and discrimination, and to assess inequities at the                 classroom, school and national levels.                        This section provides an overview of the five key frameworks that have been adapted                for  gender  analysis  in  education:  the  Harvard  Analytical  Framework,  Moser  Framework,                 Gender  Analysis  Matrix,  Women’s  Empowerment  Framework,  and  the  Social  Relations                Approach. Each of these frameworks and elements of many of these frameworks have been                 altered,  combined  and  implemented  for  a  variety  of  purposes  by  practitioners  and                policymakers in the field of education. The following description briefly highlights some of the                conceptual  theories  and  the  opportunities  and  challenges  for  implementation  of  gender                 analysis.                        Before considering the utility of gender analysis frameworks in education, it is important                for users to keep in mind that each framework has limitations and must be tailored to meet the                 circumstances of a particular context. Most of the tools associated with the gender analysis                frameworks can be adapted to a variety of levels and stages. Yet, each is based on a certain                approach  and  set  of  values  that  need  to  be  acknowledged  by  the  user  (Leach,  2003). In                 addition, gender analysis frameworks are not a panacea to the issues of gender inequality in                development  or  education.  They  enable  the  user  to  better  examine  gender  disparity,  but                 without necessarily revealing all of the underlying causes or consequences related to men,                women, boys and girls. Rather than serving as an end, the frameworks are simply a “starting                point for collective analysis and discussion and for the identification of strategies and action                 plans” (Leach, p. 3). As there is a risk of over‐generalizing findings, it is imperative that the                frameworks be integrated into a comprehensive gender strategy.                 Gender analysis frameworks                        Harvard Analytical Framework.  The Harvard Analytical Framework is based on an                economic argument for the analysis of access and control of resources. Developed at the                 Harvard Institute for International Development in 1985, the framework serves as a starting                point  in  the  design,  implementation,  or  monitoring  and  evaluation  process  to  reveal                implications for women, men, girls and boys. The framework has been commonly used in                 schools to reveal formal and informal discrimination and stereotyping. It can lead to raised                awareness,  discussion  of  the  causes  and  consequences  of  discrimination  and,  possibly,                changes in policy and practice.","One of the limitations of the Harvard Analytical Framework is that it is “not aimed at                gender transformation but at an equitable share of resources, which in itself may not help                 women,” and may even be detrimental to their position (Leach, p. 54). The framework does                not focus on the underlying causes of gender inequity, but rather argues for the inclusion of                women  as  a  mechanism  for  efficiency.  Unlike  some  of  the  later  frameworks,  it  does  not                 examine  the  relationships  between  those  of  different  genders,  nor  does  it  connect                interventions with strategic gender goals. While easy to use, the tools can be overly simplistic,                 which “distort the reality and underestimate the complexity of most situations” (Leach, p. 54).                The  challenges  of  implementation  also  include  facilitating  constructive  discussions  about                findings, designing strategic plans based on data collected, and generating sex‐disaggregated                 data when unavailable.                        Women’s  Empowerment  Framework.  The  Women’s  Empowerment  Framework,                 developed  by  Longwe  in  the  late  1990s,  is  designed  to  assess  commitment  to  women’s                empowerment, the existence of empowerment in the context being analysed, and the impact                of empowerment on community members. In this context, empowerment relates to women’s                 participation and control of processes and benefits. The framework is based on the notion of                four  levels  of  equality.  In  descending  order  of  equality  control  they  are:  participation,                conscientisation,  access  and  welfare  (Leach,  2003).  This  framework  advances  on  the                 categories determined in the Harvard framework by creating a hierarchy for measurement. It                should be noted that lower levels do not need to be achieved for higher levels of equality, but                users should maintain realistic expectations when designing interventions.                         One of the limitations of this framework is that it provides a static picture of the situation                rather  than  measuring  change  over  time.  Like  the  Harvard  Analytical  Framework,  it  lacks                 complexity  and  fails  to  address  gender  relations.  Furthermore,  the  hierarchy  of  equality                provided in the framework tool does not necessarily provide a realistic view of the context.                        Moser  Framework.  The  Moser  Framework,  developed  by  Caroline  Moser  at  the                 Development Planning Unit of the University of London, is often used in conjunction with the                Harvard Analytical Framework to better understand the way in which productive, reproductive                 and  community  work  can  impact  the  gender  division  of  labour.  It  specifically  focuses  on                “integrating gender in all types of intervention, and to confront power relations in organizations,                communities, and social institutions” (Moser, 1999, p. 55). The framework assumes a more                 nuanced view of gender planning by arguing that it is political as well as technical, and that                conflicts exist in the planning process. The approach introduces the idea of the triple role of                women in productive, reproductive and community work and aims to examine the implications                 that these roles have on women’s participation in the development process. Moser makes a                distinction between practical needs or the needs that women or girls would themselves identify                based on their existing position in society – for example, health services – and strategic needs","or needs that challenge their subordinate position in society, such as legal representation.                These categories have been applied in education to recognize and identify the needs of girls                 regarding their access to and the process of schooling.                        This framework has been criticized for its terminology and design. For example, the                term ‘role’, used to describe the various work of women, is said to ignore the unequal power                 disparity between genders. Like many of the other frameworks, it does not allow users to                understand the often‐intersecting forms of inequality, such as class, disability or race (Moser,                 1999).  In  addition,  divisions  between  strategic  and  practical  needs  are  said  to  create  an                unrealistic dichotomy that does not suit the complicated needs of girls and women in society.                        Social  Relations Approach.   The Social Relations Approach,  developed by Naila                 Kabeer in the 1990s, is unique in that it focuses on social relations between men, women,                boys and girls, and their relationship to resources and activities. The framework uses a social‐                 justice lens to examine the aspects of social relations shared by institutions: rules, resources,                people, activities and power. In many contexts, the Social Relations framework can replace                the Harvard framework, which will allow the user to move beyond merely the identification of                 activities  and  access/control  to  highlight  other  forms  of  marginalization  –  such  as  class,                ethnicity and race – that can exist in conjunction with gender.                         In the education sector, the framework can be used to analyze education as a stand‐                alone, state run service, as well as its relation to other state services. An organizational‐level                analysis can be applied at the school level as well. Since the Social Relations Approach looks                 at  inequality  at  a  range  of  levels,  it  can  be  one  of  the  more  complicated  frameworks  to                implement, and is less suited for a participatory methodology. It requires users to possess a                detailed  understanding  of  the  interdependence  of  institutions  and  the  ways  in  which  they                 perpetuate gender inequality.                        Gender Analysis Matrix.  One of the unique features of the Gender Analysis Matrix                is that it measures impact over time. Rather than looking at the current situation of gender                 equality, the framework asks communities to consider their expectations for an intervention. It                is specifically designed so that development practitioners serve as facilitators, and community                 members  are  believed  to  have  the  knowledge  and  expertise  necessary  to  carry  out  the                analysis. The matrix was designed by Rani Parker in 1993 and features four levels of analysis:                women, men, household and community. There are also four categories of analysis: labour,                 time, resources and culture. Rather than emphasizing overarching generalities or simplifying                the causes of gender  inequality, the matrix creates a space for dialogue on the issues of                 gender at the community level.                        As the matrix is implemented on a reoccurring basis, the facilitated discussions give                rise to unexpected outcomes, issues or changes within the community. Because the focus of                 this  framework  is  to  mobilize  community  members  to  assess  their  needs,  a  well‐trained","facilitator is particularly critical for effective implementation, which can serve as a challenge.                In addition, addressing the unexpected issues that arise is not always feasible, particularly in                 resource-constrained  environments.  Finally,  the  framework  unrealistically  assumes  that                community members are agreeable to one another and are able to work in a cooperative                manner.                         Comparing  the  frameworks.    As  discussed  earlier,  the  dominant  approaches  to                gender analysis have been the WID and GAD discourses, which emphasize efficiency and                 empowerment, respectively. The Harvard Analytical Framework and Gender Analysis Matrix                subscribe to the efficiency approach to gender equality. On the other hand, the Women’s                Empowerment Framework and Social Relations Approach support the empowerment claim,                 which  argues  for  gender  equality  on  the  basis  of  women’s  agency.  Given  the  varying                approaches of the five frameworks, the emphasis on gender varies. The Harvard Analytical                 Framework, Moser Framework and Women’s Empowerment Framework were designed to                address women’s needs, unlike the Gender Analysis Matrix and Social Relations Approach,                which examine men’s activities alongside women’s.                         The frameworks were also designed to address different levels of interventions. For                example, the Gender Analysis Matrix is not particularly useful for organizational analysis, but                can be effective for project‐level interventions. The Women’s Empowerment Framework is                 more suited to analyse projects and programmes. The Moser Framework and the Harvard                Analytical Framework are suitable for planning at all levels. The Social Relations Approach is                designed  for  inter-institutional  analysis,  where  gender  relations  are  assessed  within  the                 context of family, labour market, community and state. This approach can also be adapted to                assess a single institution, just as all of the frameworks can be modified to fulfil the objectives                 of researchers, practitioners and policymakers.                        Local participation has become increasingly emphasized in development work, and                participation  is  also  underscored  in  the  gender  analysis  frameworks.  The  participatory                 approach is central to the Gender Analysis Matrix and Women’s Empowerment Approach,                and the three other frameworks can be modified to varying degrees for participatory design                 and implementation.                 Gender Roles                        Reproductive.   As defined by Moser, this involves the care and maintenance of the                household  and  its  members,  including  bearing  and  caring  for  children,  preparing  food,                 collecting  water  and  fuel,  shopping,  housekeeping,  and  family  health-care.  In  poor                communities, reproductive work is, for the most part, labor-intensive and time-consuming. It is                almost always the responsibility of women and girls.","Filipino women, especially in rural areas, are traditionally bound to take care of homes,                and  family  –  and  also  assist  in  productive  work  in  farms,  swiddens  and  home  gardens.                 Meanwhile, in self-subsistence indigenous areas, the women pound rice each day. The lack                of technologies to aid in easing daily household chores, including rice pounding, effectively                forces women to undertake strenuous activities even during their childbearing years. This                 greatly limits the engagement of women in productive employment, community activities and                political affairs, and this is reinforced by the social norms that give prominence to men in these                 spheres.                        Productive. This involves the production of goods and services for consumption and                trade  (in  employment  and  self-employment).  Both  women  and  men  can  be  involved  in                 productive activities, but their functions and responsibilities often differ. Women's productive                work is often less visible and less valued than men's (March, et al. 2005).                         Community. These activities include the collective organization of social events and                services - ceremonies and celebrations, activities to improve the community, participation in                groups and organizations, local political activities, and so on. This type of work is seldom                 considered in economic analyses, yet it involves considerable volunteer time and is important                for the spiritual and cultural development of communities. It is also a vehicle for community                organization and self-determination. Both women and men engage in community activities,                 although a gender division of labor also prevails here (March, et al. 2005).                        Moser divides community work into two different types of work. Community-managing                activities are undertaken primarily by women as an extension of their reproductive role. Such                 activities ensure the provision and maintenance of scarce resources which everyone uses,                such as water, healthcare, and education. This is voluntary unpaid work, carried out during                 women's 'free' time. Community politics are undertaken primarily by men, who take part in                organized, formal politics, often within the framework of national politics. They are usually paid                in cash for this work, or benefit indirectly through improved status or power (March, et al.                 2005).                  Methodology                         Locale of the Study. The study was conducted in public central elementary schools                in each town of Cavite.  Central elementary schools were pre-selected to reduce time and                effort in reaching the said schools as these were located in the town proper.                         Sampling  Procedure.  Total  enumeration  of  male  participants  was  employed.                Systematic random sampling was employed to select the female participants which shall be                 equivalent to the number of male participants.","A  total  of  262  elementary  teachers  from  23  central  elementary  schools  in  the                municipalities and cities of Cavite participated in the study.

Prior  to the actual distribution of  the instrument, the                developed questionnaire was pre-tested to selected public elementary school teachers who                 were not part of the target participants.  Permission from the Schools Division Superintendent                of elementary schools was sought first to obtain the number and names of faculty members.                 Once permission was granted, the self-administered survey questionnaires were distributed                to  selected  elementary  school  teachers.    Also,  interview  to  selected  participants  was                conducted to validate their responses on the questionnaires.","Data Analysis. Data gathered were tabulated and analyzed accordingly.  Descriptive                statistics,  in  terms  of  frequency  counts,  ranks,  means,  and  percentages,  will  be  used  to                 describe the primary data that will be collected among the educators.

Geographical location of the 23 Public Elementary Schools in Cavite                          Cavite province is divided in six schools’ division namely Bacoor City‚ Cavite‚ Cavite                City‚ Dasmariñas City‚ Gen. Trias City‚ and Imus City.  Among these six schools’ division‚                Division of Cavite supervises the most number of schools in the province; the other divisions                 were established by virtue of their cityhood.  Figure 2 presents the geographical location of                the 23 public elementary schools in Cavite.  Those cities/municipalities whose border lines are                colored black belong to the Schools Division of Cavite; while the other five whose border lines                 are red are those which have independent Schools Division named after the city where they                were established.

As to the type of school and the nature of class organization of","the central elementary schools, all of the central elementary schools have monograde class                organization which means that enrolled students are being taught in classes consisting of a                 single grade only.  Also‚ all schools have no annexes in the municipality/city.                Table 2.

Table  4  presents  the  sex-disaggregated  data  of  public                elementary school in terms of the number of stakeholders namely staff‚ teachers and students                for three school years.  In general, the number of stakeholders had registered an increase                 from SY 2017 – 2018 to the present school year.  It can be noticed that there is almost an                equal number of male and female staff and students in the three school years.  However, the                number of female teachers outscored the number of male teachers showing that teaching is                 still  a  female-dominated  profession  and  students  have  only  limited  encounters  with  male                and/or father figures in elementary education.  This disparity may opt teachers to build their                 environments based on familiar practices and gender identities, which may be biased towards                a particular group or gender of students; in return, they may create bias in their own literacy                experiences towards this created bias in the classroom (Florack, 2012).

Net enrolment rate                (NER)  shows  the  extent  of  coverage  in  a  given  level  of  education  of  children  and  youths                 belonging to the official age group corresponding to the given level of education (UNESCO                Institute  of  Statistics,  2009).    The  NER  for  Cavite  central  elementary  schools  gradually                increased from SY 2016-2017 to SY 2018-2019 for both boys and girls.  However, the NER of                 girls is slightly greater than the NER of boys which indicates that the proportion of girls not                enrolled at the specified level of education is lower than the proportion of boys.  In other words,                 girls have higher participation rate in schools than boys.                        On  the  other  hand,  the  cohort  survival  rate  measures  the  retention  capacity  and                internal efficiency of our education system (UNESCO Institute of Statistics, 2009). The rates                 for both boys and girls gradually increased from the school year under comparison; but girls                have  higher  survival  rates  than  boys.    This  means  that  a  high  level  of  retention  and  low                incidence of dropout among girls are being observed than with boys.                  Table 5.

It can be seen that the completion rates of boys in the elementary school are                slightly higher than those of the girls.                        Graduation Rate refers to the number of graduates from the last grade of primary                 education, regardless of age, expressed as a percentage of the population at the theoretical                graduation age for primary.  The percentage of girls who graduate from the elementary level                is slightly higher than the percentage of boys for the three school years under comparison.                         Promotion Rate is used to assess the extent of pupils who are promoted to the next                grade level.  The promotion rates for both boys and girls indicate high internal efficiency of the                 educational system as they near 100%. Again, the promotion rate of girls is slightly higher than                the promotion rate of boys for the three school years under comparison.                        Repetition  Rate  determines  the  magnitude  of  pupils  who  repeat  a  grade  level.                 However, there are more girls who repeat the same grade level for the next school year than                boys.                         School-Leaver Rate covers both pupils who do not finish a particular grade level as                well as those who finish but fail to enroll in the next grade level the following school year.  A                slight difference exists in the percentage of boys leaving the school than girls for the three                 years under comparison.","Transition Rate conveys information on the degree of access or transition from one                cycle or level of education to a higher one. The recorded transition rates for both boys and                 girls for the public central elementary schools for the three years under consideration indicate                a high level of access or transition from one level of education to the next.                        Retention  Rate  determines  the  degree  of  pupils  in  a  particular  school  year  who                 continue  to  be  in  school  in  succeeding  year.    Both  boys  and  girls  in  the  public  central                elementary schools have high retention rates for the three school years.                         Drop-Out  Rate  measures  the  phenomenon  of  pupils  from  a  cohort  leaving  school                without completion, and its effect on the internal efficiency of educational systems.  Girls have                slightly higher drop-out rate than boys for the school years under study.                         National Achievement Test.  The National Achievement Test, administered by the                Department of Education (DepEd), is a set of standardized tests addressing the major subjects                 taught  in school. This test is given to Grade 3 students  where they are assessed in both                English, Filipino, and Math and Science. A different set of tests is given to Grade 6 pupils                where each of the following 5 subjects is assigned 40 items: (Science, Math, English, Filipino                 and Social Studies). Table 7 presents the three-year results of the national achievement test                by learning area of public central elementary schools in Cavite.                        It  can  be  seen  that  the  mathematics  achievement  test  for  mathematics  gradually                 increased from SY 2016-2017 to SY 2018-2019. The achievement results fluctuate for English                and Filipino subjects. The achievement results for Science gradually decreased from the said                school years. The over-all national achievement test decreased from SY 2017-2018 to SY                 2018-2019.                Table 7.

As presented in Table 9, it can be                seen that male and female participants belong to a nuclear type of  family  with 4-6 family                members. Male participants have a family income ranging from Php20,001- Php30,000 while                 female participants have a family income ranging from Php41,001-Php50,000. It can be seen                that  both  male  and  female  participants  has  flat-type  house  structure  and  used  cemented                 materials. Also, it can be observed that both male and female participants are buying their                drinking  water  and  paying  for  local  water  utility.

Table 10 shows the gender roles in reproductive activities                that are primarily and sometimes done by members of the family. It can be observed that water                 and fuel related activities are primarily done by father and male child. In terms of health related                activities, it can be observed that both mother and father are primarily doing health-related                activities; but the burden is sometimes on the shoulders of the mothers. In terms of food related                 activities, these are perceived to be a primary role of mothers and fathers; but sometimes                done by mother and female child. In terms of other household chores, most of the activities                 are distributed to each member of the family.                 Table 10.

It                can be observed that all of the activities are usually done by male and female teachers.  In                general, female teachers spend more time in productive activities than male teachers.  This                 might be an indicative that female teachers are being extra careful of the tasks assigned to                them or male teachers are doing it in a faster way.                          In addition, both male and female teachers use different teaching strategies which are                incorporated in the discussion of the lesson.  More male teachers use film showing, inductive                 method,  concept-mapping,  inquiry  approach,  project-learning,  metacognitive,  partner-                learning, round table discussion, panel discussion, and debate as teaching strategies than                female teachers do.  On the other hand, more female teachers use deductive method, peer                 tutoring, and socio-drama as teaching strategies than male teachers do.                 Table 11.

Access  to  and  Control  over  Resources  and  Benefits  of  Male  and  Female                        Elementary Teachers of Cavite                         In the Households. In the household resources accessibility, male participants who                 have cars mostly have access to vehicles while appliances and gadgets are accessible to all                of the participants. The utilities (water, electricity, internet service and communication) and                 benefits (salary, loans, housing and bonus/incentives) are also accessible to all the male and                female  participants.  This  result  connotes  that  most  of  the  reproductive  resources  are                accessible  to  male  and  female.    In  terms  of  control  over  household  resources,  most","participants believed that vehicles are primarily controlled by male teachers while appliances,                utilities in terms of water and electricity, and benefits in terms of salaries and bonus/incentives                 are primarily controlled by female teachers.  Productive resources and benefits in terms of                loans and housing are both accessible to and controlled by male and female teachers.

As shown in Table 15, the decisions of reproductive related activities are primarily                done by both mother and father except buying of  gadgets and selecting shopping budget                 which are usually decided by mother.  However, house renovations or repairs and selecting                TV channels are usually decided by fathers. In addition, all the productive related, community                related activities, and most of the leisure activities’ decision are also primarily made by both                 mother and father.

Attending events/occasions                   Father and Mother            67.18                   Summary and Conclusions                         The  study  was  an  attempt  to  fully  understand  gender-based  differentiation  among                elementary educators in Cavite in terms of their perceived gender roles, access to, and control                over their resources.  Initially, the elementary educational institutions were characterized first                 based on their physical and demographic characteristics and then, local gender-sensitive and                responsive policies and projects were identified afterwards.  Also, data on gender roles on                reproductive,  productive,  community  and  leisure  activities  and  problems  and  constraints                 relative  to  these  activities  were  determined.    Moreover,  the  access  to  and  control  over                resources and benefits of male and female elementary teachers in the households and the                 community  were  identified.    Based  on  these,  gender-responsive  and  gender-equality                strategies were to further address these problems, needs and constraints.                        Results showed that the number of female teachers outscored the number of male                 teachers showing that teaching is still a female-dominated profession and students have only                limited encounters with male and/or father figures in elementary education.  Net enrolment                 rate  (NER)  for  Cavite  central  elementary  schools  indicates  that  the  proportion  of  girls  not                enrolled at the specified level of education is lower than the proportion of boys.  In other words,                girls have higher participation rate in schools than boys.  On the other hand, the cohort survival                 rate indicates that a high level of retention and low incidence of dropout among girls are being                observed than with boys.  In general, key performance indicators for public central elementary                schools  reveal  that  girls  outperform  boys  in  almost  every  aspect  including  completion,                 graduation, survival rates and the likes.   Although there are existing gender-sensitive and                responsive policies in the central elementary schools, they are yet to strictly implement these                inside the classroom and schools (e.g., use of gender-fair language, etc.).  In addition to the","differences  observed  in  the  general  academic  performance  of  male  and  female  teachers                (which may be a reflection of their performance when they were still students), it may be an                 eye-opener for higher authorities to consider field of specializations when assigning teachers                their subjects to teach.                        Data collected on the reproductive, productive, community and leisure activities show                 that these were equally divided among members of the family. However, results also show                that there are discrepancies in their uses of teaching strategies and female teachers spend                 more time in productive activities than male teachers.  Responsible use of time allocation for                productive activities inside the classroom must be observe.  The prevailing time allocation for                each subject in the elementary level is 40 minutes. In the study, it was observed that more                 time is consumed to other productive activities (preliminary activities) rather than the actual                lesson development.  It is suggested that time allocation be increased to accommodate more                 time for lesson development but not sacrificing the time for preliminaries.                        In terms of access to and control over resources, those resources which are usually                used by men are controlled by male teachers (e.g., vehicle, house repairs, etc.) while those                 which are usually used by women are mostly controlled by female teachers (e.g, appliances,                utilities  in  terms  of  water  and  electricity)  as  these  refer  to  their  functions  as  “mothers.”                Decision-making activities are dominated by both father and mother.  This indicates that there                 is  a  harmonious  relationship  between  mother  and  father  inside  the  homes  of  elementary                teachers.                  Implications and Recommendations                         It was found out that elementary school consists of more feminine figures from the                 principal to the teachers and staff down to the students.  Considering the national achievement                test results, higher authorities may look into the impact of recruiting more male elementary                teachers to the academic achievement of elementary pupils. This disparity may opt teachers                to build their environments based on familiar practices and gender identities, which may be                 biased towards a particular group or gender of students; and in return, students may create                bias in their own literacy experiences towards this created bias in the classroom (Florack,                 2012).  Hence,  the  elementary  educational  institutions  may  increase  their  attention  in  the                recruitment as this may be beneficial to elementary education considering the impacts of male                teachers in the holistic well-being of elementary pupils.                         Results show that there are discrepancies in the teachers’ use of teaching strategies                in terms of gender and female teachers spend more time in productive activities than male                 teachers.    Studies  also  show  that  there  are  disparities  in  girls’  and  boys’  academic                performances  showing  girls  outperform  boys  in  reading  (Chadwell,  2010)  while  boys                outperform girls in mathematics and science (Dickey, 2013). These studies only looked for","disparities  in  the  pupil’s  academic  performance  when  they  were  taught  by  mostly  female                teachers.   However,  one may  explore  possible  research  study  on the  impact  of  teachers’                 gender into pupil’s academic performances while identifying effective gender-specific teaching                strategies.  Also, since public elementary schools were dominated by female teachers, one                may also explore the reasons for this domination and the possible impact of male teachers in                 the elementary level in terms of pupil’s academic performance, attendance, and other aspects                of pupil’s life.                         In terms of access to and control over resources, those resources which are usually                used by men are controlled by male teachers (e.g., vehicle, house repairs, etc.) while those                which are usually used by women are mostly controlled by female teachers (e.g, appliances,                 utilities  in  terms  of  water  and  electricity)  as  these  refer  to  their  functions  as  “mothers.”                Decision-making activities are dominated by both father and mother.  This indicates that there                 is  a  harmonious  relationship  between  mother  and  father  inside  the  homes  of  elementary                teachers.

Since then, the Research                  Center (RC) has evolved to function as one of the trilogy roles of the University. To date, the                 University is the seat of the national research, development, and extension for coffee – a status                 bestowed by the Department of Agriculture Bureau of Agricultural Research.                          The  Research  Center  exerted  serious  efforts  toward  streamlining  the  Research,                 Development, and Extension (RDE) Program by establishing a strong and effective research                 program aimed to generate innovative and viable technologies useful to farmers and other                  clients.  This  is  done  with  the  goal  of  improving  their  standard  of  living.  The  University’s                 research  program  focuses  on  coffee  research,  development,  and  extension.  However,  to                 accommodate the ever-increasing need for RD\&E activities brought about by the development                 of  the  University  into  a  comprehensive  one,  these  thrusts  have  become  more  elaborate                 through the “Faculty and Students Research Capability Enhancement Program” that has been                 approved by the University Board of Regents in 2004.                           The  University  has  maintained  ties  and  established  collaborative  projects  with                 international  and  local  agencies  with  emphasis  on  plantation  crops,  high  value  fruits  and                 vegetables, ornamentals, herbs and spices and poultry and livestock among others.                          The research of the University is anchored into specific thrusts otherwise known as                 thematic areas which set the direction for the researchers on which disciplines or commodities                 to prioritize. These thrusts have evolved from fourteen to seven as follows: Strengthening                  Leadership in Coffee R\&D; Mainstreaming Kaong R\&D towards Environmental Protection and                 Poverty  Alleviation;  Sustainable  Agriculture  and  Fisheries;  Environment  and  Natural                 Resources; Engineering and Technology Development; Health and Wellness; and Human and                 Societal Development.","However, it was deemed appropriate to remove the first two thematic areas because                 these are commodity-focused. Presently, the research thematic areas are as follows: Agri-                 Fisheries  and  Food  Security;  Biodiversity  and  Environmental  Conservation;  Smart                 Engineering,  Information  and  Communication  Technology,  and  Industrial  Competitiveness;                  Social Development and Equality; and Public Health and Welfare.
