From 1918 to 1958, there were several transformations in the name of                        the school from Indang Farm School to Indang Rural High School and                        then  to  Don  Severino  National  Agricultural  School.    The  name  Don                        Severino was in honor of the late Don Severino de las Alas who was                        then  the  Interior  Secretary  of  the  Aguinaldo  Revolutionary                        Government. In 1964, the school was converted into a State College by                        virtue  of  the  Republic  Act  No.  3917  and  became  known  as  the  Don                        Severino Agricultural College.                                The  conversion  of  the  school  into  a  college  paved  the  way  for                        expansion of its academic offerings. In response to the challenges of                        Project CALABARZON,  schools such as School of Arts and Sciences,                        School  of  Education  and  School  of  Engineering  were  created  in                        addition to the school of Agriculture in 1992.                                In  1993,  in  recognition  of  its  potentials  and  achievements,  the                        college was designated by the Department of Education, Culture and                        Sports  (DECS)  as  the  Regional  College  of  Agriculture  (RCA)  for  the                        Southern  Tagalog  Region.    Being  the  RCA,  DSAC  was  mandated  to                        assist seven (7) Provincial Technical Institutes of Agriculture (PTIAs) of                        the  region  in  the  improvement  of  their  curriculum  and  instructional                        programs, practical and applied researchers, and training of PTIA staff                        and  to  lead  in  the  production  of  instructional  materials.    The  year                        1998  stands  out  as  the  most  important  historical  milestones  of  the                        school.  DSAC was converted into the present Cavite State University                        (CvSU) upon passage of Republic Act No. 8468 on January 22, 1998.                        In the year 2000, the University was designated by the Commission on                        Higher  Education  (CHED)  as  the  Center  of  Development  for                        Agriculture  and  Agricultural  Engineering.    CHED  also  authorized                        CvSU  to  be  a  CHED  accreditor  in  accordance  with  the  Policies  and                        Guidelines on the Implementation of the Expanded Tertiary Education                        Equivalency and Accreditation Program (ETEEAP).                                  Presently,  the  University  is  an  active  host  and/or  sponsor  of                        various  regional  and  national  research  and  extension  programs  that                        cater to the needs of farmers, mentors, entrepreneurs and private as                        well  as  government  personnel.    The  University  also  exerts  serious                        efforts towards streamlining its Research, Development and Extension                        (RD\&E) Program.  The two major research and extension thrusts are:                        Coffee RD \& E and Urban Agriculture RD\&E                                                                                                       241","CvSU MANUAL OF OPERATIONS                    _____________________________________________________________________                                                                                                             242                                                        INTRODUCTION                                 Research  at  the  Cavite  State  University  began  with  the                        conversion  of  Indang  Rural  High  School  into  Don  Severino                        Agricultural  College  in  1964.  Since  then  The  Research  Center  has                        evolved  to  function  as  one  of  the  trilogy  roles  of  the  University.    To                        date, the University is the seat of the national research, development                        and  extension  for  coffee–a  status  bestowed  by  the  Department  of                        Agriculture Bureau of Agricultural Research.                               The  Research  Center  (RC)  exerted  serious  efforts  towards                        streamlining  the  Research,  Development  and  Extension  Program  by                        establishing  a  strong  and  effective  research  program  aimed  to                        generate  innovative  and  viable  technologies  useful  to  farmers  and                        other clienteles. This is done with the goal of improving their standard                        of  living.  The  University’s  research  program  focused  on  coffee                        research,  development  and  extension.  However,  to  accommodate  the                        ever  increasing  need  for  RD\&E  activities  brought  about  by  the                        development of the university into a comprehensive one, these thrusts                        have  become  more  elaborated  through  the  “Faculty  and  Students                        Research Capability  Enhancement Program” that has been approved                        by the University Board of Regents in 2004.                                    The   university    has    maintained       ties    and    established                        collaborative  projects  with  international  and  local  agencies  with                        emphasis  on  plantation  crops,  high  value  fruits  and  vegetables,                        ornamentals,  herbs  and  spices  and  poultry  and  livestock  among                        others.

Section 3.  Finance                                     1.  Sources of Funds                                           Financial      resources       are     generated       through                                  international      and     local    grants,    donations,      bilateral                                  agreements  and  collaborations  with  government  agencies,                                  local  and  foreign  funding  institutions  and  other  research                                  agencies and councils.                                            There  are  two  major  classifications  of  fund  sources:                                  the  internal  and  external  funds.    The  internal  funds  come                                  from  the  general  appropriation  allocation  (GAA)  of  the                                  Philippine  government.    The  Center  also  generates  funds                                  from the Income Generating Project of its various units.   On                                  the  other  hand,  the  external  funds  come  from  government                                  agencies such as DA-BAR, PCARRD, INIBAP, and STIARC as                                  well  as  foreign  agencies,  private  organizations  and  industry                                  partners.                                       2.  Handling of Research Funds                                           All  research  funds  are  handled  by  the  Finance                                  Management  Office  in  coordination  with  the  Office  of  the                                  Director  of  Research.    Books  of  accounts  are  kept  by  the                                  Accounting Department which is also under the supervision                                  of the Director of Administrative and Support Services.                                            Research  funds  that  are  externally  funded  are  pooled                                  and  treated  as  trust  funds.  The  Director  of  Research                                  exercises  general  control  over  all  these  research  grants.                                  These  are  deposited  in  the  bank  as  trust  fund  lumped                                  together  to  earn  interest.    Funds  are  released  to  the                                  Accounting  Office  by  project  allotments.    The  project/study                                  leaders  handle  all  the  processing  of  papers  to  release  the                                  fund meant for their research projects/studies.  Fund from                                  income  generating  projects  are  also  being  handle  by  the                                  Accounting  Division  with  full  control  of  the  Research                                  Director.                                     3.  Control of Research Fund                                           Research funds will be reported in terms of obligation                                  or  liquidation.    The  Accounting  Department  controls                                  expenditures in accordance with the items in the budget and                                  sub-allotment.

Reporting  of  financial  statement  is  done  by  the                                  Accounting  Department  of  the  Office  of  the  Administrative                                  and Support Services following the accounting and auditing                                  rules and regulations.                                            As in any government agency, expenditure incurred in                                  the implementation of research and development program in                                  SUCs  will  be  subjected  to  pre-auditing  and  post  auditing                                  procedure prescribed by the Commission on Audit (COA).The                                  internal audit which is under the supervision of the Director                                  of    Administrative       and     Support     Services     pre-audits                                  expenditures.

System of Making Research and Development Plans                                        The R and E planning process may involve the following:                                      Assessment of environment.  Program planning which is                             done by R and E management in coordination with the RECETS                             starts with the analysis of the factors in the environment relevant                             to the R and E programs. Environment factors refer to the set of                             forces  both  inside  and  outside  the  organization  that  affects                             organization’s  performance  (Certo,  1994).    The  internal                             environmental  factors  that  can  be  considered  are  institutional                             capacity, structure, support system (financial and administrative)                             and organizational management.                                     Major consideration of the external factors can be focused                             on the political and national policies, laws and procedures of the                             government  as  well  as  the  development  programs  of  National                             Development  Authority  (NEDA),  Department  of  Agriculture  (DA),                             Department  of  Science  and  Technology  (DOST),  Department  of                             Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) and Commission on                             Higher Education (CHED).                                     Setting  of  priorities.  In  setting  the  R  and  E  priorities  and                             agenda the institution should consider its national and regional                             thrusts  and  mandates.    It  should  also  consider  the  information                             and feedback from various agencies and source such as:                                             National Agencies.  The national priorities set by the                                           various agencies  are usually referred to and serve as                                           basis for setting R and E priorities and agenda of an                                                                                                       251","CvSU MANUAL OF OPERATIONS                    _____________________________________________________________________                                                                                                             252                                           institution  of  higher  learning.

It  requires  the                                  process  of  anticipation  and  analysis  of  a  broad  range  of                                  socio-cultural,  technical,  economic,  environmental  and                                  political/legal  impact  prior  to  the  introduction  of  a  given                                  technology  or  even  while  a  specific  technology  is  being                                  promoted.    The  success  of  the  technology  assessment                                  depends on the efficient gathering and synthesis of adequate                                  information.  The TAP, which was developed by PCARRD in                                  2000,  embodies  some  recent  innovations  in  technology                                  assessment  procedures  and  processes.    The  processes  are                                  facilitated by the use of a gap identification tool called Quick                                  Resources Appraisal (QRA), and an intervention identification                                  tool - the Risk Management Process (RMP).  The TAP aims to                                  increase the level of confidence of the R \& D community on                                  the technologies it will promote and transfer.                                           A  pre-requisite  to  the  application  of  TAP  is  the                                  organization  of  an  interdisciplinary  team  composed  of  at                                  least  five  (5)  members  with  two  basic  expertise  that  are                                  critically needed:  a technically competent expert who knows                                  the  technology  and  the  commodity  being  assessed  and  an                                  economist with capabilities in financial analysis.

Mechanics of Implementation                          1.  The  workload  system  applies  to  all  faculty  members  who  are                           involved in R \& E activities either full-time or part-time.                          2. For purposes of workload credit, the assigned task external to the                           university  shall  be  covered  by  a  Memorandum  of  Agreement                           between the University and the partner Agency or a Special Order                           from the office of the University President.                          3.  A faculty member shall have a minimum of 18 credit units in R \&                           E to be classified full-time researcher/extensions.                                                                                                        263","CvSU MANUAL OF OPERATIONS                    _____________________________________________________________________                                                                                                             264                        4.  A full-time faculty member shall be entitled to workload credit in R                           \& E only if he/she has satisfied the minimum workload of 18 credit                           units in teaching and R \& E work.                          5.  A program leader who is a project leader and a study leader in the                           same program shall only be credited once whichever has the higher                           credit units.                         6. Overload pay shall be given to faculty researchers whose total credit                           units is beyond 25 units                         7.  Faculty  member  with  external  activity  to  R\&E  and  has  received                           honorarium for such activity shall not be given credit units                          8.  All claims for credit units shall be supported by proper documents.                         9. Credit units as researcher/extensions shall only be claimed for the                           period specified in the program/project study activity as approved.                         10.  Workload  accreditation  of  other  R\&E  activities  not  covered  by                             these  guidelines  shall  be  referred  to  the  Office  of  the  Vice                             President  for  Research  \&  Extension  for  consideration  upon  the                             approval of the President.                         11. The rate of overload pay or honorarium is similar to those on full                             time    teaching.                         12. The funds for the overload shall come from the R \& E allocation or                             from other sources which the University deems appropriate.                             Honorarium                                   Honorarium is a form of remuneration granted to researchers                           for services rendered beyond the minimum/regular workload.  It is                           a  form  of  incentive  granted  for  the  services  of  officials/employees                           on special assignment.   For this purpose, a special assignment is                           an  undertaking  by  an  individual  or  a  composite  group  of                           officials/employees,  which  is  beyond  their  regular  and  primary                           functions.                                                                                                                         264","CvSU MANUAL OF OPERATIONS                    _____________________________________________________________________                                                                                                             265                           Types of Honoraria                                   Those  paid  to  a  government  official  or  employee  or  private                           individual who is requested to speak, lecture, or act as a resource                           person in seminars, workshops, conferences,  symposia, trainings,                           or classroom sessions (AMMRO, Book I as cited by UPLB Research                           Manual, 2002)                                   Those paid to a government official or employee by another                           office in which he/she is on detail or special assignment provided                           that  if  he/she  is  already  collecting  similar  compensation  or                           allowance for the same service or period for which payment is being                           claimed he/she may only choose to collect whichever is higher but                           in  no  case  shall  he/she  receive  both  (UPLB  Research  Manual,                           2002)                                   Those  paid  to  a  government  official/employee  or  private                           individual  for  his  membership  in  or  special  assignment  to                           committees or special projects.

Monitoring and evaluation                             Research Projects                                    The  research  projects  are  monitored  in  two  ways:  (1)  the                           financial and (2) the technical aspects.                                    The  accounting  department  of  the  University  monitors  and                           audits  the  financial  status  of  the  research  funds.  However,  the                           Special  Budget  Officer  of  the  Research  Center  records  every                           disbursement  for  each  research  project/unit  and  annotates  the                           Purchase Request Forms to indicate availability of funds and from                           which funds the purchases are to be credited.                                   The  Office  of  the  Director  of  Research  serves  as  the                           monitoring  and  coordinating  arm  for  all  researches  in  the                           University.    Although  research  activities  are  independently                           undertaken  by  the  different  colleges,  faculty  researchers  are  still                           required  to  submit  quarterly  progress  reports  on  their  research                           projects/studies.  The researchers submit their progress reports to                           their  respective  Deans  concerned,  which  in  turn  endorses  the                           progress  reports  to  the  Office  of  the  Director.

The AACCUP guidelines in accrediting academic programs of colleges and                    universities  also  look  at  the  kind  of  research  outputs  the  colleges  are                    producing during the time of evaluation.                     Faculty  members  who  serve  as  thesis  advisers  have  no  continuing                    research project(s) in spite their potential in proposing and implementing                    researches along their fields of specialization and experiences.                      Thesis  in  the  graduate  and  undergraduate  levels  as  well  as  in  the                    laboratory school are expensive and need some forms of financial support                    in pursuing student’s researches with improved quality of output.                     Faculty  research  project  may  also  accommodate  and  fund  thesis  of                    students.                      Students and faculty members need to expose and be more confident and                    in coming up with quality of outputs.                     There  is  need  for  the  colleges  to  identify  workable  and  doable  research                    thrust, agenda and program that will serve as guide in implementing the                    research activities of the university.                     For  these  activities,  the  university  has  a  starting  capital  of  one  million                    pesos for the research project of the colleges.                                                                                                          311","CvSU MANUAL OF OPERATIONS                    _____________________________________________________________________                                                                                                             312                    ___________________________                      1   Prepared  and  submitted  by  SIMEON  S.

It shall protect and secure                    the  exclusive  rights  of  scientist,  inventors,  artists  and  other  gifted                    citizens  to  their  intellectual  property  and  creations,  particularly  when                    beneficial to the people.”                             With  the  various  intellectual  properties  (IP’s)  developed  in  the                    university  such  as  the  Aguinaldo  Blend  Coffee,  processed  products,                    design  for  biogas  digester  and  innumerable  research  outputs  being                    presented  for  public  consumption,  a  few  of  them  were  able  to  acquire                    protection. The biogas digester was just recently granted a patent, while                    research  outputs/publications  have  been  presented  without  copyright                    protection,  except  for  some  that  were  able  to  acquire  ISBN  registration                    from  the  National  Library.  Therefore,  the  University  must  develop  a                    system  for  protecting  economically  viable  intellectual  properties  to                    maximize gains that could finance more researches in the future.

A variety may                    be  represented  by  seed,  transplants,  plants,  tubers,  and  tissue  culture                    plantlets.                             “Prior art”   Everything made available to the public by means of a                    written or oral disclosure, by use, or in any other way, before the filing                    date  or  the  priority  date  of  the  application  claiming  the  invention.                    Prior use which is not present in the Philippines, even if widespread in a                    foreign country, cannot form part of the prior art if such prior use is not                    disclosed in printed documents or in any tangible form.                      III. Objective                             To establish a system protecting the intellectual properties (IP’s) or                    results/products  generated  through  researches  conducted  in  the                    university.                     IV. Strategy                             The  University  shall  establish  an  IPR  Office  that  covers  all                    intellectual property protection activities and provide trainings/seminars                    to  researchers  to  increase  awareness  on  IPR.  The  IPR  Office  will  be                    divided in to two sections, each having IPR Assistants, one for patentable                    IP’s and the other for publishable IP’s.                             The IPR Officer will work under the Office of the Vice-President for                    Research,  Extension,  Continuing  Education  and  Training  Services                    (RECETS), and is tasked to identify, protect and exploit commercially on                      1  Section 4, R.A. 8293 (1998); TRIPS.                    2  Section 21, R.A. 8293 (1998).                                                                                                       320","CvSU MANUAL OF OPERATIONS                    _____________________________________________________________________                                                                                                             321                    the  University’s  behalf  the  intellectual  property  rights  generated  by  the                    University’s researchers.

The  IPR                    Officer will be required to work in close coordination with both research                    and  academic  units  of  the  university  to  identify  research  results  and                    intellectual property rights with commercial potential. In this capacity the                    IPR  Assistants  will  be  responsible  for  applying  for  and  liquidating  cash                    advances  accrued  during  the  applications  and  payment  of  other  fees                    pertinent  to  the  application.  Where  necessary  the  IPR  Officer  will  work                    with the University’s legal advisers.                            The  IPR  Officer  and  IPR  Assistants  will  be  provided  with                    appropriate external training to ensure that they can become competent                    in all aspects of the role.                     Other responsibilities include the following:                             Formulate,  propose  and  implement  governing  guidelines  in                    patenting/copyrighting research results in the University                            Deal  with  agencies  requesting  for  commercialization  rights  for                    patented/ copyrighted materials from the university, enter into licensing                    agreements and manage the payment of royalties.
