Faculty Members                 Rationale:  The  T3  Campuses  have  envisioned  to  establish  a  culture  where  faculty  and                students  shall  engage  in  research.  Hence,  the  faculty  members,  especially  those  with                plantilla  positions  and  in  professional  rank,  are  encouraged  to  produce  an  approved  and                funded  research  in  line  with  the  University’s  Research  Thrust.  Each  faculty  member                recognizes the importance of this endeavor as part of their core functions as academician.                However, the number of funded research is still very low at present for the three campuses                maybe because there is a need for knowledge enhancement of the protocols in writing a                research proposal and that makes this activity relevant. This capacity building activity would                serve  as a  stepping  stone  for  the  faculty  members  to be  able  to  write  a  quality  research                work. The activity further aims to increase the number of funded researches in the campus                as well as the number of research publications.                 Objectives: This faculty research writing seminar-workshop aims to:                1.  Delineate the standards and concepts in writing a research proposal with possibility for                    funding by the University or through external funding sources; and                2.  Apply the concepts learned to produce quality and relevant research proposal at the end                    of the seminar.

Gatdula,  CvSU-                General Trias City Instructor, as in-charge of the ceremonies.                 Prof.  Noel  A.  Sedigo,  T3  Campus  Administrator,  gave  the  welcome  message,  which                emphasized  the  importance  of  research  in  teaching,  saying  that  most  educators  are                accustomed  to  using  materials  culled  from  other  countries  when  one  of  the  major                components of life in the academe is innovation through research. He said that this was how                teachers should be teaching their corresponding subject matters. He also mentioned that it                took years for him to finally find his own niche in his field.

V01-2018-07-17","For the first speaker, Dr. Yolanda A. Ilagan, Director of the Research Center, discussed the                importance of research to the University and its faculty members. She emphasized how hard                work plays an important role in one’s commitment to research and that workload should not                be a hindrance. She further mentioned that by the year 2025, innovation would be the main                focus of the University. The importance of research was personal satisfaction, points in the                NBC  evaluation,  additional  income,  networking  and  collaboration,  and  travel.  She                encouraged interdisciplinary research. She also tackled the different thematic areas of the                research and extension agenda of CvSU: agri-fisheries and food security, biodiversity and                environmental  conservation,  smart  engineering,  ICT  and  industrial  competitiveness,  public                health and welfare, and societal development and equality. She also talked about the official                research  proposal  format  of  the  university,  which  consists  of  the  following:  overview,                problem, importance, literature, objectives, and time and place. Finally, she tackled how to                write  quality  research  proposals  for  possible  funding,  as  well  as  crafting  a  convincing                introduction that includes the rationale and objectives. She credited Dr. Bautista’s book on                technical writing for the contents of her lecture on the principles of writing a good research                proposal and concluded her talk by emphasizing that researchers need to cherish their work                and that there was no actual recipe for success but just “simple rules, dedication, and hard                work.”                                                            Dr. Yolanda A. Ilagan discusses the importance of                                   research to the T3 faculty and staff.                                                               Dr. Yolanda A. Ilagan talks about the different                                    thematic areas of the research and extension                                    agenda of CvSU.                                                                                                V01-2018-07-17","Dr. Yolanda A. Ilagan receives her certificate of                                     appreciation from Prof. Sedigo.                  For  the  second  speaker,  Dr.  Isaias  A.  Banaag,  Faculty  Researcher  of  the  College  of                Education  (CED)  gave  his  talk  on  how  to  create  a  viable  theoretical  and  conceptual                framework  for  research.  He  talked  about  the  common  error  regarding  the  Input-Process-                Output (IPO), which was in fact, a model or framework and not a method. He further said                that the framework was actually different from the research paradigm, a source of difficulty in                most research papers. The problem, he said, was actually rooted in problem building, the                problem being the driving force behind a research, which should be geared to address gaps                between  what  was  happening  and  what  should  be  happening.  Structure  or  maps  were                needed in order to come up with broad areas to be covered in the research. This would help                the researcher to emerge from chaotic thinking and into a more logical, organized viewpoint                for the research problem at hand. He also explained the difference between a theoretical                framework and a conceptual framework: a theoretical framework is used when there is only                one  theory  featured  in  a  basic  research,  whereas  a  conceptual  framework  is  used  when                there are multiple theories and other personal observations that need to be synthesized in a                more  complex  type  of  research.  He  also  distinguished  a  construct  from  a  variable—the                construct being a concept with a deliberate and invented meaning, while a variable being a                construct with an assigned numerical value. He ended his discussion by summarizing the                differences  between  a  theoretical  framework  and  a  conceptual  framework:  a  theoretical                framework is “adopted from a pre-existing theory or theoretical perspective, an application of                a  theory  as  a  whole  or  in  part,  and  with  a  literature  research  that  is  deductive”  while  a                conceptual framework is “created from a variety of conceptual and theoretical perspective, a                synthesis of relevant concepts, and with research literature that is usually inductive.”                                                           Dr. Isaias A. Banaag discusses the importance of                                     problem-building in research.

V01-2018-07-17","For the third speaker, Dr. Renato N. Pelorina, Faculty Researcher of the College of Arts                and Sciences, discussed how to write the review of related literature and the methodology                portion of a research proposal. He talked about the most common sources available for use                in a researcher’s review of related literature. He emphasized the importance of reading and                mobility, spending time going over various references and going to different places in order                to  find  relevant  material  for  one’s  research.  He  said  that  the  best  materials  were  those                articles published within the last five years, on a case-to-case basis, depending on the field.                Non-referred (i.e., not peer-reviewed) journals, newsletters, and magazines were considered                unreliable sources of literature. He stated the most common problem in research was the                lack  of  available  literature. When  literature  as  limited,  he  said,  a  researcher may  conduct                field work or interviews to determine whether the topic was worth pursuing; if not, then the                researcher should consider changing the topic. He also highlighted several key points such                as always thinking of what one’s research will contribute to the field and avoiding duplication                in order “locate one’s research within the context of existing literature.” He further said that a                literature review could be arranged either chronologically or thematically, and that citation                provide evidence of the researcher’s interpretation of the sources gathered. Being selective                was very important, in that the researcher must choose only the most important points to be                included  in  the  review.  One  must  also  exercise  caution  when  paraphrasing  to  avoid                plagiarism.  It  was  also  important  to  keep  one’s  “voice”  and  restrain  oneself  from  being  a                collection of different authors’ voices despite the fact that review must definitely include the                “big  names”  or  experts  on  the  field.  The  review  must  be  punctuated  with  one’s  own                perspective and interpretation of the new knowledge presented. He also discussed common                mistakes such as not relating clearly to the research problem, not taking sufficient time to                identify the most relevant sources to use, not relying on primary research studies, and only                including sources that validate one’s assumptions rather than those that refute them.

Pelorina as he prepares                              for his talk.                                                                                                          V01-2018-07-17","Dr. Renato N. Pelorina gives his introduction to the topic                                   on review of related literature.                                                  Dr. Renato N. Pelorina receives his certificate of appreciation                                 from Prof. Sedigo.                  For the fourth speaker, Dr. Agnes C. Francisco, another faculty researcher of the College                of Arts and Sciences, talked about methods and methodology in the field of social sciences.                She  first  distinguished  a  “method,”  a  technical  step  taken  to  do  research,  from  the                “methodology,” a discussion of the underlying reason why particular methods will be used.                She said that the methodology portion of the research will answer questions on how the data                will be collected or generated and then analyzed, and clearly articulates the reasons why a                researcher  has  chosen  a  particular  procedure  or  technique.  She  further  stated  that  this                section specifically features how the data gathered must be treated in order to achieve the                objectives of the research. It also discusses problems that are anticipated and how they can                be minimized through the chosen methods. For her, this was very important because the                method  a  researcher  chooses  affects  the  results;  thus,  “an  unreliable  method  produces                unreliable results.” A faulty methodology brings about a “domino effect,” affecting all other                aspects  of  the  research  and  lessening  the  value  of  one’s  findings.  She  mentioned  the                important sections of the methodology section: the research design (whether quantitative or                qualitative, including the specific type or types to be used), the sampling technique (how the                data  will  be  collected  and  what  safeguard  techniques  will  be  used),  the                respondents/participants  or  source/corpus  for  those  studies  involving  discourse  (who  will                participate  and  how  many)  the  research  instrument,  the  unit  of  analysis  (for  coding  in                                                                                               V01-2018-07-17","discourse), the data gathering procedure, and the data analysis portion. She emphasized the                importance  of  anonymity  in  this  section,  especially  for  respondents  who  have  been                interviewed,  and  other  agencies  involved  in  the  data-gathering  portion.  She  further                recommended that 30% of the existing population was enough for a qualitative research and                8-10 respondents for a qualitative one in order to ensure that the chosen sample was a good                representative of the population, with the inclusion of corresponding profiles and justification                for being selected. She reminded everyone about the importance of pre-testing for self-made                instruments and to make sure that the tool specifically addressed the objectives and problem                of  the  research.  Other  reminders  were  regarding  the  use  of  free-prior  informed  consent                (FPIC)  or  waivers  for  sensitive  topics  with  ethical  issues  involved  and  avoiding  the                unnecessary inclusion of definitions. Overall, she recommended the following components of                an effectively written methodology section:  an clear methodological approach, a justification                for how the chosen approach fits the research design, the specific methods to be used, the                manner  in  which  the  data  will  be  analyzed,  a  solid  rationale  for  the  methodologies  to  be                used,  a  well-supported  reason  for  the  choice  of  respondents,  and  a  comprehensive  yet                concise scope and limitations section.                                                 Dr. Agnes C. Francisco begins her talk on how to                                 effectively write the methodology portion in the                                 field of social sciences.                                                         Dr. Agnes C. Francisco continues with her talk on                                     the main components of writing an effective                                    methodology section.

Alimboyuguen,  another  faculty  researcher  of  the                College of Arts and Sciences, talked about methods and methodology in the field of natural                sciences. For this area, it describes the activities necessary for the completion of a project,                mainly because it provides information that allows the reader to validate the results and the                conclusion. She said that some key requirements of a good natural science research were                the following: understandable and repeatable, conforms to objectives, and confined to the                procedures and methods. She said that there were specific details to be included such as                the manufacturer or model of the specialized equipment to be used, the sample to be used,                time  and  place,  replications,  and  conditions  of  the  experiment,  data  analysis,  statistical                analysis.  She  concluded  her  talk  by  emphasizing  that  research  impact,  academic                consequences, and societal consequences were three major considerations in research in                the natural sciences. The value of one’s research in terms of its long-term benefits was what                counts. The beneficiaries should be the students, faculty and staff, farmers, government and                private  institutions,  industry  and  other  clientele  outside  the  CvSU  community.  Publishable                and patentable work was what they were looking for in this field. Impact assessment was no                longer  the  measure  of  success  in  research  but  whether  there  was  a  policy  that  was                developed out of the research. She encouraged everyone to copyright their works. Towards                the end of her discussion, it was established, through the moderatorship of Prof. Sedigo, that                the  T3  Campuses  will  focus  on  these  specific  programs:  Information  and  Computer                Technology  (ICT),  Education,  Business  Management  (Entrepreneurship),  Hospitality                Management (Product Development).                                                    Dr. Agnes B. Alimboyuguen talks about the key                                     requirements of a good natural science research.

Alimboyuguen and Prof. Sedigo                                     encourage the audience to ask questions during                                     the open forum.

Further discussions on the following topics ensued throughout the faculty capability-building                seminar:  the  budgetary  requirements  and  work  plan,  the  major  activities  and  expected                output, and the potential impact and target beneficiaries of the given research.                 Ms. Roncesvalle J. Caipang, T3 Research Coordinator who spearheaded and organized                the  capability  building  seminar,  gave  her  closing  remarks  by  thanking  everyone  for  their                attendance and for a very productive day. Afterwards, Prof. Sedigo announced that on April                1-2, he will be evaluating all proposals before endorsing them to the Research Center on                April 3, 2019, not later than 6:00 p.m. All research titles were then submitted by the faculty                members who no doubt became inspired and motivated at the end of the two-day capability-                building seminar.
