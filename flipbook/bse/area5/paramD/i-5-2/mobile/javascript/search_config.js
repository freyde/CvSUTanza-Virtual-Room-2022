The institution supports the                           researchers in all of the following                           activities:                          I.5.2.  paper presentations, journal                                          publication, classroom lectures,                                          and other similar activities;","Research Manual and Policies","","RESEARCH                                                       INTRODUCTION                          Research at the Cavite State University (CvSU) began with the conversion of Indang                 Rural High School into Don Severino Agricultural College in 1964. Since then, the Research                  Center (RC) has evolved to function as one of the trilogy roles of the University. To date, the                 University is the seat of the national research, development, and extension for coffee – a status                 bestowed by the Department of Agriculture Bureau of Agricultural Research.                          The  Research  Center  exerted  serious  efforts  toward  streamlining  the  Research,                 Development, and Extension (RDE) Program by establishing a strong and effective research                 program aimed to generate innovative and viable technologies useful to farmers and other                  clients.  This  is  done  with  the  goal  of  improving  their  standard  of  living.  The  University’s                 research  program  focuses  on  coffee  research,  development,  and  extension.  However,  to                 accommodate the ever-increasing need for RD\&E activities brought about by the development                 of  the  University  into  a  comprehensive  one,  these  thrusts  have  become  more  elaborate                 through the “Faculty and Students Research Capability Enhancement Program” that has been                 approved by the University Board of Regents in 2004.                           The  University  has  maintained  ties  and  established  collaborative  projects  with                 international  and  local  agencies  with  emphasis  on  plantation  crops,  high  value  fruits  and                 vegetables, ornamentals, herbs and spices and poultry and livestock among others.                          The research of the University is anchored into specific thrusts otherwise known as                 thematic areas which set the direction for the researchers on which disciplines or commodities                 to prioritize. These thrusts have evolved from fourteen to seven as follows: Strengthening                  Leadership in Coffee R\&D; Mainstreaming Kaong R\&D towards Environmental Protection and                 Poverty  Alleviation;  Sustainable  Agriculture  and  Fisheries;  Environment  and  Natural                 Resources; Engineering and Technology Development; Health and Wellness; and Human and                 Societal Development.","However, it was deemed appropriate to remove the first two thematic areas because                 these are commodity-focused. Presently, the research thematic areas are as follows: Agri-                 Fisheries  and  Food  Security;  Biodiversity  and  Environmental  Conservation;  Smart                 Engineering,  Information  and  Communication  Technology,  and  Industrial  Competitiveness;                  Social Development and Equality; and Public Health and Welfare.

Finance                         a.  Sources of Funds. Financial resources are generated through grants, donations,                            bilateral  agreements  and  collaborations  with  government  and  non-government                            agencies  private  institutions,  foreign  funding  institutions  and  other  research                            agencies and councils. There are two major classifications of fund sources: the                            internal and external funds. The internal funds come from the general appropriation                             allocation (GAA) of the Philippine government. The Center also generates fund                            from various income generating projects of the University and a portion of which is                            allocated for the conduct of the University’s research activities. On the other hand,                            the external funds can come from government agencies such as Department of                            Agriculture (DA), Department of Science and Technology (DOST), Commission on                            Higher Education (CHED), and others: private individuals and institutions both in                            the Philippines and abroad; foreign government, and non-government agencies                             such  as  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development  (USAID),  United                            Nations (UN) and others.                         b.  Handling of Research Funds.  All research funds are handled by the Finance                            Management Office in coordination with the Office of the Director for Research.                            Books of Accounts are kept by the Accounting Department under the supervision                             of  the  Vice  President  for  Administrative  and  Support  Services.  Personnel  is                            assigned  at  the  Accounting  Department  to  handle  documents  of  all  research                            projects of the University to expedite processing.                                       External research grants are treated as trust funds. Funds are released                            to the Accounting Department by project allotment whereby project/study leaders                            handle  the  processing  of  papers  to  release  the  fund  meant  for  their  research                            projects/studies. Research funds allocated  from the income generating projects","are also handled by the Accounting Department and managed by the Director for                            Research.                         c.  Management of Research Funds. Research funds shall be reported in terms of                            obligation or liquidation. The Accounting Department monitors the expenditures in                             accordance with the items in the budget and sub-allotment. Payrolls, vouchers,                            request for supplies and materials and other obligations of the projects shall be                            paid through the Accounting Department with approval from the Vice President for                            Administrative and Support Services following the accounting and auditing rules                            and  regulations.  As  with  any  government  agency,  expenditures  incurred  in  the                            implementation of research programs in State Universities and Colleges (SUCs)                             shall be subjected to auditing procedures prescribed by the Commission on Audit                            (COA).  The  internal  audit  which  is  under  the  supervision  of  the  Office  of  the                            President and a representative from COA shall conduct the auditing.                  Article  4.  System  of  Making  Research  and  Development  Plans  and  Research                 Opportunities in the University                         Section 1. Research and Development Planning Process.  The Research Center                 conducts  research  in  accordance  with  the  University’s  research  agenda  in  line  with  the                 regional, national, and global thrusts.                          Research planning involves the assessment of the external and internal environments                 and anchoring the results of the analysis with the University’s vision and mission.                         The external environment refers to the ecological, economic, legal, political, social and                 technological factors that affect the University while the internal environment considers the                 institutional capacity, structure, support, and systems affecting the organization.                         The  assessment  of the  environment  leads  to  the  analysis  of  the  opportunities  and                 threats (external analysis) as well as its strengths and weaknesses (internal analysis) which                  then leads to evaluation of the gaps in research that should be filled and hence, help plan the                 University's future directions.","Section 2. Research Opportunities                         Section 2.1.  CvSU Research and Creative works Grant. Cavite State University                         (CvSU) supports the research, development and creative activities of faculty members                         through the CvSU Research and Creative works Grant.  The grant is intended to bolster                          the  research  capacity  through  procuring/upgrading  equipment,  supplies  (e.g.                         glassware, chemicals, media, among others), software and other requirements which                         in the long run will build the current faculty strengths and establish the reputation of the                         laboratories/research  centers.  Researches  that  are  in  line  with  the  institutional,                         regional, national and global thrusts are encouraged. These include creative works or                         scientific queries that are curiosity- driven (involving basic research), problem-based                          (applied  research)  or  investigations  along  the  interface  of  traditional  disciplines.                         Proposals  with  innovative  and  creative  approaches  in  addressing  the  research                         problem/subject under study and of multidisciplinary and collaborative nature shall be                         given high priority.                         This grant will also support high quality creative works, enhancing the overall quality of artistic                         production of the university. Artistic disciplines include: visual arts (painting, drawing, sculpture,                          ceramics, and textiles), performing arts (dance, music, theatre), film, video, performance art,                         architecture, design, creative writing, interdisciplinary arts, media and digital/electronic arts, and                         new and innovative artistic practices.                         Overall, this aims to support scholarly pursuits, nurture creativity and innovation and                         promote a research culture in the University. Eventually, it is envisioned that through                         the CvSU Research and Creative works Grant, the University’s research and creative                         works  performance  shall  soar  through  increased  publication,  copyright,  and  patent                          certification.  The  knowledge  and  arts  created  and  the  technology  developed  shall                         eventually be cascaded to the community, consistent with the aspirations of becoming                         a global University in the near future.                                As a Level 4 AACCUP-accredited HEI, CvSU’s academic standing is measured                         by the quality of researches and instruction performance; with the weight of research                          and instruction among the highest in the parameters evaluated and of equal value.

The process of proposal preparation and submission of proposals is similar to the                         CRCG.                         Section 2.3. Undergraduate and Graduate Thesis Grant. This funding is for students                          who wish to avail of funding support for their thesis but could not because there is no                         faculty  research  project  to  anchor  their  thesis  into.  Undergraduate  thesis,  design                         projects,  case  studies,  and  other  researches  of  a  similar  nature  that  are  part of  a                         student's degree requirement for graduation and have corresponding credit need some                         form  of  financial  support  and  therefore,  must  be  considered  for  funding.  Similarly,                          graduate students of the university are also in need of financial support to complete                         their master's thesis or doctoral dissertation can avail of this funding support because","while these students can seek grants from external sources such as CHED or DOST,                          these grant-giving bodies are very selective and the evaluation process take some                         time.

A lower                            amount may be granted depending on the objectives of the study as determined                            by the Research Center. Moreover, a higher amount may be granted based on                             justifiable reasons and soundness of the proposal. The source of the funds will be                            the income of the University.                         Section 2.4. College/Campus Research Fund. The College/RDE research funds are                         allotted by the RDE unit as maintenance, operating, and other expenses (MOOE). The                         college research fund comes from the ten percent allocation for research as described                         in  the  CHED  Memorandum  Order  No.  20  Series  of  2011.  At  least  20%  of  the                         college/campus research fund shall be allotted to the conduct of R and D projects.                          Section  2.5.  External  Research  Grants.  Cavite  State  University  also  receives                         research  grants  and  support  from  several  government  institutions  as  well  as  non-                         government  organizations  (NGOs),  and  private  partners.  Some  of  the  government                         funding agencies that provide grant-in-aids for researches  at CvSU include CHED,                         DOST, and DA-BAR. Externally-funded R and D projects may be accommodated in a                          foundation. These need not pass the usual government purchasing and accounting                         process.  Further,  the  project  leader  and  staff  are  allowed  to  implement  the  project","during  official  working  hours  and  allowed  to  use  the  university  facilities.  A  certain                          amount of the project’s fund is given to the University.                 Article 5.

Preparation  of  the  research                          proposal can be initiated by the Research Center when external funding agencies or                         private institutions call for submission of proposals or when other agencies ask for help                         on certain issues that necessitates research investigation. The Research Center may                         seek the help of researchers in the University in the preparation of the proposals as                         well as external experts.                                The Research Center also calls for submission of proposals for funding by the                          University under the CRCG, and RRG. Proposals then undergo an evaluation process.                         In  the  event  that  proposals  are  qualified  for  funding  by  an  external  agency,  the                         proponent can then choose a preferred funding institution.                                The proposal submitted may be a research activity of the College where the                         researcher belongs to or it could be a collaborative undertaking involving other units in                         the University or elsewhere. At any rate, these activities must be coordinated with the                          Research Center to ensure that the proposals are in line with the University’s research                         agenda.                                The proponents shall submit research proposals using the prescribed format                         (with attachments). All proposals submitted for internal funding should be endorsed by                         the College/Campus Dean or Unit Head. Prior to submission, all proposals should have                         been pre-evaluated by the proponent using the Evaluation Checklist of Harmonized                         Gender  and  Development  Guidelines  (HGDG)  for  Program/Project  Development.

The AACCUP guidelines in accrediting academic programs of colleges and                    universities  also  look  at  the  kind  of  research  outputs  the  colleges  are                    producing during the time of evaluation.                     Faculty  members  who  serve  as  thesis  advisers  have  no  continuing                    research project(s) in spite their potential in proposing and implementing                    researches along their fields of specialization and experiences.                      Thesis  in  the  graduate  and  undergraduate  levels  as  well  as  in  the                    laboratory school are expensive and need some forms of financial support                    in pursuing student’s researches with improved quality of output.                     Faculty  research  project  may  also  accommodate  and  fund  thesis  of                    students.                      Students and faculty members need to expose and be more confident and                    in coming up with quality of outputs.                     There  is  need  for  the  colleges  to  identify  workable  and  doable  research                    thrust, agenda and program that will serve as guide in implementing the                    research activities of the university.

Rationale                            Republic  Act  No.  8293,  otherwise  known  as  the  Intellectual                    Property Code of the Philippines, states that:                             “The  State  recognizes  that  an  effective  intellectual  and  industrial                    property  system  is  vital  to  the  development  of  domestic  and  creative                    activity,  facilitates  transfers  of  technology,  attracts  foreign  investments,                    and ensures market access for our products.  It shall protect and secure                    the  exclusive  rights  of  scientist,  inventors,  artists  and  other  gifted                    citizens  to  their  intellectual  property  and  creations,  particularly  when                    beneficial to the people.”                             With  the  various  intellectual  properties  (IP’s)  developed  in  the                    university  such  as  the  Aguinaldo  Blend  Coffee,  processed  products,                    design  for  biogas  digester  and  innumerable  research  outputs  being                    presented  for  public  consumption,  a  few  of  them  were  able  to  acquire                    protection. The biogas digester was just recently granted a patent, while                    research  outputs/publications  have  been  presented  without  copyright                    protection,  except  for  some  that  were  able  to  acquire  ISBN  registration                    from  the  National  Library.  Therefore,  the  University  must  develop  a                    system  for  protecting  economically  viable  intellectual  properties  to                    maximize gains that could finance more researches in the future.                      II. Definition of Terms                             “Copyright” is  the  protection  extended  to  expressions  and  not  to                    ideas, procedures, and methods of operations or mathematical concepts                    as  such.  Such  expressions  may  be  in  the  forms  of  literary,  scholarly,                    scientific and artistic works.                            “Intellectual Property or IP” is an asset that possesses commercial                    value  which  can  be  exploited  to  generate  revenue.  IP  value  lies  in  its                    utilization, not existence.                            “Intellectual Property Rights” or “IPR” refers to the entitlement and                    enjoyment of the attributes of ownership over intellectual properties. IPR                    consists  of:  a)  Copyright  and  related  rights;  b)  Trademarks  and  Service                    Marks;  c)  Geographic  Indications;  d)  Industrial  Designs;  e)  Patents;  f)                    Layout-Designs (Topographies) of Integrated Circuits; and g) Protection of                                                                                                               319","CvSU MANUAL OF OPERATIONS                    _____________________________________________________________________                                                                                                             320                    Undisclosed Information.  IPR shall likewise include plant varieties  and                                                  1                    animal breeds.                            “Patent’       is a grant issued by the Philippine government giving                    an  inventor  the  right  to  exclude others  from  making,  using,  setting,  or                    importing the product of his invention within the Philippines in exchange                    of his patentable information or disclosure.                            “Patentable inventions”  means any technical solution of a problem                    in  any  field  of  human  activity  which  is  new,  involves  an  inventive  step                    and is industrially applicable, which may be, or may related to a product,                    or process, or an improvement of any of the foregoing.                                                                                   2                            “Plant variety”       means a plant grouping within a single botanical                    taxon of the lowest known rank which can be defined by the expression                    of the characteristics resulting from a given genotype, or combination of                    genotypes,  distinguished  from  any  other  plant  groupings  by  the                    expression  of  at  least  one  characteristic  and  considered  as  a  unit  with                    regard to the suitability for being propagated unchanged. A variety may                    be  represented  by  seed,  transplants,  plants,  tubers,  and  tissue  culture                    plantlets.                             “Prior art”   Everything made available to the public by means of a                    written or oral disclosure, by use, or in any other way, before the filing                    date  or  the  priority  date  of  the  application  claiming  the  invention.                    Prior use which is not present in the Philippines, even if widespread in a                    foreign country, cannot form part of the prior art if such prior use is not                    disclosed in printed documents or in any tangible form.                      III. Objective                             To establish a system protecting the intellectual properties (IP’s) or                    results/products  generated  through  researches  conducted  in  the                    university.                     IV. Strategy                             The  University  shall  establish  an  IPR  Office  that  covers  all                    intellectual property protection activities and provide trainings/seminars                    to  researchers  to  increase  awareness  on  IPR.  The  IPR  Office  will  be                    divided in to two sections, each having IPR Assistants, one for patentable                    IP’s and the other for publishable IP’s.                             The IPR Officer will work under the Office of the Vice-President for                    Research,  Extension,  Continuing  Education  and  Training  Services                    (RECETS), and is tasked to identify, protect and exploit commercially on                      1  Section 4, R.A. 8293 (1998); TRIPS.                    2  Section 21, R.A. 8293 (1998).                                                                                                       320","CvSU MANUAL OF OPERATIONS                    _____________________________________________________________________                                                                                                             321                    the  University’s  behalf  the  intellectual  property  rights  generated  by  the                    University’s researchers.                            The  IPR  Officer  will  be  involved  in  identifying  and  protecting  the                    University’s  intellectual  property  rights,  and  in  conforming  to  existing                    systems in managing, recording and tracking the progress of intellectual                    property  applications  and  commercialization  of  the  property.  The  IPR                    Officer will be required to work in close coordination with both research                    and  academic  units  of  the  university  to  identify  research  results  and                    intellectual property rights with commercial potential. In this capacity the                    IPR  Assistants  will  be  responsible  for  applying  for  and  liquidating  cash                    advances  accrued  during  the  applications  and  payment  of  other  fees                    pertinent  to  the  application.  Where  necessary  the  IPR  Officer  will  work                    with the University’s legal advisers.                            The  IPR  Officer  and  IPR  Assistants  will  be  provided  with                    appropriate external training to ensure that they can become competent                    in all aspects of the role.                     Other responsibilities include the following:                             Formulate,  propose  and  implement  governing  guidelines  in                    patenting/copyrighting research results in the University                            Deal  with  agencies  requesting  for  commercialization  rights  for                    patented/ copyrighted materials from the university, enter into licensing                    agreements and manage the payment of royalties.
