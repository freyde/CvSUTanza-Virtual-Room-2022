Mechanics of Implementation                          1.  The  workload  system  applies  to  all  faculty  members  who  are                           involved in R \& E activities either full-time or part-time.                          2. For purposes of workload credit, the assigned task external to the                           university  shall  be  covered  by  a  Memorandum  of  Agreement                           between the University and the partner Agency or a Special Order                           from the office of the University President.                          3.  A faculty member shall have a minimum of 18 credit units in R \&                           E to be classified full-time researcher/extensions.                                                                                                        263","CvSU MANUAL OF OPERATIONS                    _____________________________________________________________________                                                                                                             264                        4.  A full-time faculty member shall be entitled to workload credit in R                           \& E only if he/she has satisfied the minimum workload of 18 credit                           units in teaching and R \& E work.                          5.  A program leader who is a project leader and a study leader in the                           same program shall only be credited once whichever has the higher                           credit units.                         6. Overload pay shall be given to faculty researchers whose total credit                           units is beyond 25 units                         7.  Faculty  member  with  external  activity  to  R\&E  and  has  received                           honorarium for such activity shall not be given credit units                          8.  All claims for credit units shall be supported by proper documents.                         9. Credit units as researcher/extensions shall only be claimed for the                           period specified in the program/project study activity as approved.                         10.  Workload  accreditation  of  other  R\&E  activities  not  covered  by                             these  guidelines  shall  be  referred  to  the  Office  of  the  Vice                             President  for  Research  \&  Extension  for  consideration  upon  the                             approval of the President.                         11. The rate of overload pay or honorarium is similar to those on full                             time    teaching.                         12. The funds for the overload shall come from the R \& E allocation or                             from other sources which the University deems appropriate.                             Honorarium                                   Honorarium is a form of remuneration granted to researchers                           for services rendered beyond the minimum/regular workload.  It is                           a  form  of  incentive  granted  for  the  services  of  officials/employees                           on special assignment.

Monitoring and evaluation                             Research Projects                                    The  research  projects  are  monitored  in  two  ways:  (1)  the                           financial and (2) the technical aspects.                                    The  accounting  department  of  the  University  monitors  and                           audits  the  financial  status  of  the  research  funds.  However,  the                           Special  Budget  Officer  of  the  Research  Center  records  every                           disbursement  for  each  research  project/unit  and  annotates  the                           Purchase Request Forms to indicate availability of funds and from                           which funds the purchases are to be credited.                                   The  Office  of  the  Director  of  Research  serves  as  the                           monitoring  and  coordinating  arm  for  all  researches  in  the                           University.    Although  research  activities  are  independently                           undertaken  by  the  different  colleges,  faculty  researchers  are  still                           required  to  submit  quarterly  progress  reports  on  their  research                           projects/studies.  The researchers submit their progress reports to                           their  respective  Deans  concerned,  which  in  turn  endorses  the                           progress  reports  to  the  Office  of  the  Director.
