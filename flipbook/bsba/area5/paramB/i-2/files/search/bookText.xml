                                                    INTRODUCTION


                       Research at the Cavite State University (CvSU) began with the conversion of Indang

               Rural High School into Don Severino Agricultural College in 1964. Since then, the Research


               Center (RC) has evolved to function as one of the trilogy roles of the University. To date, the

               University is the seat of the national research, development, and extension for coffee – a status

               bestowed by the Department of Agriculture Bureau of Agricultural Research.


                       The  Research  Center  exerted  serious  efforts  toward  streamlining  the  Research,

               Development, and Extension (RDE) Program by establishing a strong and effective research

               program aimed to generate innovative and viable technologies useful to farmers and other


               clients.  This  is  done  with  the  goal  of  improving  their  standard  of  living.  The  University’s

               research  program  focuses  on  coffee  research,  development,  and  extension.  However,  to

               accommodate the ever-increasing need for RD&E activities brought about by the development

               of  the  University  into  a  comprehensive  one,  these  thrusts  have  become  more  elaborate

               through the “Faculty and Students Research Capability Enhancement Program” that has been

               approved by the University Board of Regents in 2004.



                       The  University  has  maintained  ties  and  established  collaborative  projects  with

               international  and  local  agencies  with  emphasis  on  plantation  crops,  high  value  fruits  and

               vegetables, ornamentals, herbs and spices and poultry and livestock among others.


                       The research of the University is anchored into specific thrusts otherwise known as

               thematic areas which set the direction for the researchers on which disciplines or commodities

               to prioritize. These thrusts have evolved from fourteen to seven as follows: Strengthening


               Leadership in Coffee R&D; Mainstreaming Kaong R&D towards Environmental Protection and

               Poverty  Alleviation;  Sustainable  Agriculture  and  Fisheries;  Environment  and  Natural

               Resources; Engineering and Technology Development; Health and Wellness; and Human and

               Societal Development.]]></page><page Index="25"><![CDATA[However, it was deemed appropriate to remove the first two thematic areas because

               these are commodity-focused. Presently, the research thematic areas are as follows: Agri-

               Fisheries  and  Food  Security;  Biodiversity  and  Environmental  Conservation;  Smart

               Engineering,  Information  and  Communication  Technology,  and  Industrial  Competitiveness;


               Social Development and Equality; and Public Health and Welfare.

                 Section 3. Finance

                       a.  Sources of Funds. Financial resources are generated through grants, donations,

                          bilateral  agreements  and  collaborations  with  government  and  non-government

                          agencies  private  institutions,  foreign  funding  institutions  and  other  research

                          agencies and councils. There are two major classifications of fund sources: the

                          internal and external funds. The internal funds come from the general appropriation


                          allocation (GAA) of the Philippine government. The Center also generates fund

                          from various income generating projects of the University and a portion of which is

                          allocated for the conduct of the University’s research activities. On the other hand,

                          the external funds can come from government agencies such as Department of

                          Agriculture (DA), Department of Science and Technology (DOST), Commission on

                          Higher Education (CHED), and others: private individuals and institutions both in

                          the Philippines and abroad; foreign government, and non-government agencies


                          such  as  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development  (USAID),  United

                          Nations (UN) and others.

                       b.  Handling of Research Funds.  All research funds are handled by the Finance

                          Management Office in coordination with the Office of the Director for Research.

                          Books of Accounts are kept by the Accounting Department under the supervision


                          of  the  Vice  President  for  Administrative  and  Support  Services.  Personnel  is

                          assigned  at  the  Accounting  Department  to  handle  documents  of  all  research

                          projects of the University to expedite processing.

                                     External research grants are treated as trust funds. Funds are released

                          to the Accounting Department by project allotment whereby project/study leaders

                          handle  the  processing  of  papers  to  release  the  fund  meant  for  their  research

                          projects/studies. Research funds allocated  from the income generating projects]]></page><page Index="41"><![CDATA[are also handled by the Accounting Department and managed by the Director for

                          Research.

                       c.  Management of Research Funds. Research funds shall be reported in terms of

                          obligation or liquidation. The Accounting Department monitors the expenditures in


                          accordance with the items in the budget and sub-allotment. Payrolls, vouchers,

                          request for supplies and materials and other obligations of the projects shall be

                          paid through the Accounting Department with approval from the Vice President for

                          Administrative and Support Services following the accounting and auditing rules

                          and  regulations.  As  with  any  government  agency,  expenditures  incurred  in  the

                          implementation of research programs in State Universities and Colleges (SUCs)


                          shall be subjected to auditing procedures prescribed by the Commission on Audit

                          (COA).  The  internal  audit  which  is  under  the  supervision  of  the  Office  of  the

                          President and a representative from COA shall conduct the auditing.

               conducts  research  in  accordance  with  the  University’s  research  agenda  in  line  with  the

               regional, national, and global thrusts.


                       Research planning involves the assessment of the external and internal environments

               and anchoring the results of the analysis with the University’s vision and mission.

                       The external environment refers to the ecological, economic, legal, political, social and

               technological factors that affect the University while the internal environment considers the

               institutional capacity, structure, support, and systems affecting the organization.

                       The  assessment  of the  environment  leads  to  the  analysis  of  the  opportunities  and

               threats (external analysis) as well as its strengths and weaknesses (internal analysis) which


               then leads to evaluation of the gaps in research that should be filled and hence, help plan the

               University's future directions.]]></page><page Index="42"><![CDATA[Section 2. Research Opportunities

                       This grant will also support high quality creative works, enhancing the overall quality of artistic

                       production of the university. Artistic disciplines include: visual arts (painting, drawing, sculpture,


                       ceramics, and textiles), performing arts (dance, music, theatre), film, video, performance art,

                       architecture, design, creative writing, interdisciplinary arts, media and digital/electronic arts, and

                       new and innovative artistic practices.

                       Overall, this aims to support scholarly pursuits, nurture creativity and innovation and

                       promote a research culture in the University. Eventually, it is envisioned that through
