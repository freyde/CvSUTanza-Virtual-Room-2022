TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION            Introduction:              Curriculum, instruction, and assessment are the three essential components                              of an education system, whether online or face to face (Orlando, 2011).  These three                              components  must  be  equally  strengthen  for  a  successful  teaching  and  learning                              process.  To achieve desired learning outcomes, successful integration of content and                              meaningful assessment with effective pedagogy is necessary (Roth, 2017).  In the                              advent of COVID-19 pandemic, Philippine higher education institutions (HEIs) have                              explored  and  shifted  to  other  innovative  learning  modalities  that  transmigrate  the                              conduct  of  classes  from  traditional  or  face-to-face  to  flexible  learning  modalities.                              During these critical times, the development of coherent and cohesive curriculum is                              seemingly  overwhelming,  even  to  experienced  teachers.  Crizaldo,  Fabregar,  and                              Alitagtag  (2020)  recommended  ten  priority  areas  to  consider  in  the  successful                              implementation of flexible learning in the new normal; student competency being the                              most crucial.  In the delivery of flexible learning, students and faculty are expected to                              redesign a teaching-learning experience adaptive of the new normal so that optimum                              results can be achieved.                                      As assessment stimulates learner's attitudes and behaviors towards learning                              a  certain  competency,  it  must  be  constructively  aligned  with  the  curriculum  and                              instruction. Its results must be communicated to the learners to keep an eye on the                              progress  of  attaining  targets  so  that  appropriate  intervention  could  be  done  if                              necessary.  However, in most (if not all) cases, teachers and administrators are often                              concerned about what to teach and how to teach such content, leaving behind the                              assessment component.  As a result, the assessment component is often to be the                              weakest  of  the  three,  the  least  understood  and  the  least  effectively  implemented.                              Assessment protocols are seemingly important to be integrated into curriculum if a                              well-established  degree  of  success  in  reaching  the  desired  learning  outcomes  is                              desired.  Understanding by Design (UbD) by Grant Wiggins and Jay McTighe provides                              a framework that systematically addresses these key issues in a practical manner.                                      Guided  by  the  UbD  framework,  this  research  will  help  determine  specific                              knowledge  and  skills  to  be  assessed  in  a  particular  discipline  in  flexible  learning                              environment, including evidences of understanding and effective tools that best match                              in attaining these competencies.  Furthermore, instruction will be so designed to equip                              students  to  best  meet  these  knowledge  and  skills.    An  assessment  guide  will  be                              developed based on these elements.            Objectives:               Assessment is done primarily on boosting student learning and development,                              and rather than merely according grades.  It affords learners an opportunity to reflect                              on their performance and determine the extent of their progression towards achieving                              learning targets with the aid of teacher's feedback.  When learning institutions engage                              in  particular  instructional  strategies,  they  will  in  fact  be  trying  to  align  learning                              outcomes with certain assessment methodologies.  However, due to a number of key                              variables affecting the effectiveness of assessment in education, learning outcomes                              are often assessed several times with no rationale.  Thus, this study will be conducted                              to determine assessment strategies that could improve student's learning in the new                              normal  classroom  set  up.

The input is composed of the learning targets (specific knowledge and skills),                              assessment tools, evidence of learning (or understanding) and learning activities.                                     The process involves an analysis of the input in order to come up with the                              desired  output  of  the  study.  This  research  project  rests  on  the  Understanding  by                              Design® framework (UbD™ framework) developed by Wiggins, G., \& McTighe, J.                              (1998). It offers a planning process which aims to structure curriculum, assessment,                              and  instruction  which  1)  focus  on  teaching  and  assessing  for  understanding  and                              learning transfer, and 2) design curriculum  \"backward\" from those ends. The UbD                              framework offers a three-stage backward design process for curriculum planning.                                     The output is the assessment guide that will be proposed to assist educators                              in determining effective assessment tools used in flexible learning.  Along this line, an                              assessment guide will be developed and designed to further provide  alignment of                              assessment to curriculum and instruction.                                                                             Figure 1.  Research Concept Frame                                      The Understanding by Design framework is described as follows:                                     Stage 1: Identify desired results focuses on identifying the enduring concepts                              and  desired  student  outcomes  before  outlining  specifics  of  the  content.  Enduring                              concepts  are  important  ideas  or  core  processes  that  are  transferable  to  new                              situations, have lasting value beyond the classroom, are at the heart of the discipline,                              and are often abstract, counterintuitive, and misunderstood. What should students                              know,  understand,  and  be  able  to  do?  What  is  worthy  of  understanding?  This                              approach avoids two critical errors in teaching: textbook coverage or teaching for rote                              memorization  and activity-based  teaching  that  may  be  engaging  but  has  no  clear                              priorities.  Ideas  are  provided  for  differentiating  enduring  understandings  from  the                              knowledge and skills supporting those understandings and from second-level skills or                              factual knowledge.                                     Stage  2:  Determine  acceptable  evidence concentrates  on  the  variety  and                              depth of assessment tasks that are needed to validate that the student has achieved                              the  desired  enduring  understanding.  How  will  a  teacher  know  if  students  have                              achieved the desired results? Students reveal understanding when they participate in                              complex,  authentic  opportunities  to  engage  in  the  six  facets  of  understanding                              identified by Wiggins and McTighe:                                        •  Explanation provides thorough, supported, and justified accounts of                                            phenomena, facts, and data.","B.  TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION                                         •  Interpretation is designed to personalize information, contributing to                                            relevancy and long-term retention.                                        •  Application provides opportunities to utilize and apply understanding                                            in diverse contexts.                                        •  Perspective sees points of view through critical eyes and ears, the big                                            picture.                                        •  Empathy finds value in what others might find odd, alien, or                                            implausible; i.e., to perceive sensitively on the basis of prior direct                                            experience.                                        •  Self-knowledge recognizes that personal style, prejudices,                                            projections, and habits of mind shape and impede one's own                                            understanding.                                     Meaningful assessment requires a variety of tools, including informal checks                              in  class,  observation  and  student  dialogue,  formal  quizzes  and  tests,  academic                              prompts,  and  open-ended  assessment  tasks.  GRASPS  (goal,  role,  audience,                              situation, product or performance, standards for success) is provided as a prompt for                              the teacher in constructing quality performance tasks scenarios. UbD then embarks                              on an in-depth discussion of designing appropriate scoring rubrics. Effective rubrics                              relate specific task requirements to more general performance goals, discriminate                              among different degrees of understanding or proficiency, do not combine independent                              criteria, and include all potential performance outcomes differentiating from novice to                              expert. The more open-ended the assessment tasks, the more essential a strong                              rubric becomes.                                     Stage  3:  Plan  learning  experiences  and  instruction occurs  when  enduring                              understandings and appropriate evidence of understanding culminate in an effective                              instructional activity. It is often the case that assessment in the classroom begins with                              stage 3, where a teacher's favorite activity is conducted in class without consideration                              of expected outcome or adequate assessment. The backward design process flips                              from starting at stage 3 to beginning at stage 1 and moving to stage 3. The driving                              factor  is  the  enduring  concept,  not  the  activity.  Stage  3  essentially  asks,  \"What                              activities will equip students with the desired knowledge and skills?\" This requires the                              teacher to consider the intersection of engaging tasks and effective tasks. Activities                              at this intersection motivate students to explore understandings and misconceptions.                                     The sieve for activity design is called  WHERE. How will you help students                              know  Where  they  are  headed  and Why?  How  will  you Hook  students  through                              engaging and thought-provoking experiences? What events, real or simulated, can                              students Experience to make the ideas and issues real? What learning activities will                              help students to Explore the big ideas and essential questions? What instruction is                              needed to Equip students for the final performance? How will you cause students                              to Reflect and Rethink to dig deeper into the core ideas? How will you guide students                              in Rehearsing, Revising,  and Refining  their  work  based  on  feedback  and  self-                              assessment?  How  will  students Exhibit  their  understanding  about  their  final                              performances and products? How will you guide them in self-Evaluation to identify the                              strengths and weaknesses in their own work and set future goals?                                     A key concept in UbD framework is alignment – all three stages must clearly                              align  not  only  to standards,  but also  to one another.  In  other  words,  the  Stage 1                              content and understanding must be what is assessed in Stage 2 and taught in Stage                              3. The research process is resembled in Figure 1, where the UbD is used as the main                              framework.","B.  TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION                               Original procedure/methodology                              a.  Locale of the Study                                        The study will be conducted at Cavite State University trying to determine                                 the assessment strategies used in flexible learning environment across various                                 disciplines.                              b.  Research Design                                        The  study  will  use  a  descriptive-evaluative  research  design  in  order  to                                 come up with the desired outputs. The descriptive nature of this research will be                                 used  to  understand  and  describe  the  assessment  strategies  used  in  flexible                                 learning  environment  in  the  new  normal.    The  evaluative  component  of  the                                 research design will be used to measure the effectiveness of these strategies,                                 especially in attaining learning targets and designing learning activities.                              c.  Sampling Procedure                                        Purposive sampling will be used in selecting CvSU faculty participants to                                 this study.  Those faculty members with less than a year of teaching experience                                 will  be  removed  from  the  list  since  they  are  yet  to  have  experienced  some                                 assessment strategies, both in the face-to-face and in the new normal.                              d.  Data Collection Procedure                                        Study 1-5.  Data will be collected among the participants through online                                 surveys  and  focus  group  discussion.  There  will  be  three  sets  of  research                                 instruments to be used in this study. The first instrument contains the modalities                                 and tools used in assessing student's learning in the new normal and this has two                                 versions: one for the student and one for the instructor/professor.                                        The second instrument is the interview protocol that will be used during the                                 focus  group  discussion.    It  is  intended  for  interview  of  selected  students  and                                 instructor/professors involved in the study.                                        Finally, a Virtual Classroom Assessment Observation Protocol is prepared                                 to  determine  the  detailed  assessment  used  by  each  faculty  member  in  their                                 course/s handled.                                        Sample  assessment  activities/outputs  such  as,  but  not  limited  to,                                 examinations with TOS, rubrics, performance tasks, written tasks, portfolio, and                                 self-report, will be collected from the students and instructor/professors.                                        Data that will be gathered in Studies 1-5 will be used to formulate flexible                                 learning assessment framework that any educator can be used in the new normal.                                 Using  this  proposed  framework,  an  assessment  guide  will  be  designed  and                                 developed  that  will  further  assist  educators  in  effectively  aligning  curriculum,                                 instruction and assessment. The developed assessment guide will be validated by                                 three experts before it could finally be used.                                         Study 6. The developed assessment guide will be introduced to faculty                                 members in the CvSU system through series of webinar and trainings before the                                 start of the semester of AY 2022 – 2023.  Its acceptability will be determined.  A                                 rating  system  will  be  used  to  evaluate  the  developed  assessment  guide  on                                 assessment  of  learning  in  the new normal.    This  is  intended  for  evaluation  by                                 students, instructor/professor, and experts.                                         Prior  to  the  actual  distribution  of  the  instrument,  the  developed                                 questionnaires will be pre-tested to selected students and some faculty members","B.  TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION                                  who were not part of the study to determine its validity and reliability.  Once validity                                 and reliability are established, this will be sent to the students and faculty members                                 involved in the study.  An online form of these questionnaires will be prepared to                                 reduce the cost of transportation and reproduction of research instruments.                              e.  Data Analysis                                       The  developed  questionnaires  will  be  subjected  to  validation  by  some                                 experts in the field. Cohen's Kappa coefficient will be used to measure the inter-                                 rater reliability or agreement between two or more experts to assess the validity of                                 these documents.                                       All  data  to  be  gathered  will  be  tabulated  and  analyzed  accordingly.                                 Descriptive statistics such as, but not limited to, frequency counts, ranks, means,                                 and percentages, will be used to describe the primary data that will be collected                                 among the graduates and employers. The data will be treated and analyzed using                                 appropriate  statistical  tests  with  the  aid  of  the  Statistical  Packages  for  Social                                 Sciences v. 22.                                       Weighted means will be computed based on the participants' responses and                                 will be converted accordingly.                                       Table 2.

Monitoring and evaluation                                        As  part  of  monitoring  activities,  quarterly  meeting  and  report  will  be                                 conducted and submitted.  This is to ensure that every activity is implemented as                                 planned and every problem encountered is resolved.                              g.  Ethical Considerations                                        Informed consent from the university president and campus administrators                                 will be obtained using relevant documentation before the conduct of the study.                                 These documents will include informed invitation letters to conduct the research                                 at the university and its campuses, informed invitation letters to participants and                                 the learners for their participation.                               To protect their basic rights, privacy, and confidentiality, all direct identifiers will be                                   removed.  Before and during the transcriptions of the observed lessons, all                               participants will be given fictive names, as well as with the pre-service teacher and                               school.  This is an important step that none of the participants will be recognizable.

Students enrolled in programs other than the teacher education,  i.e,  BS  Business          recommendatio ns       Management, BS Information Technology, BS Psychology, and others, found it difficult                                 to respond in some parts of the questionnaire due to the technicality and unfamiliarity                                 of the names and/or use of assessment tools in higher education. The researchers                                 then included some definitions of those unfamiliar terms and also translated them in                                 Filipino) to find out what the research intended to find out from the participants.                               2.

Specifically, the study aimed to: (1) determine the demographic profile of                       the respondents; (2) determine the preference of the respondents between e-commerce                       and traditional business; (3) measure the level of satisfaction of the respondents on e-                       commerce;  (4)  measure  the  level  of  satisfaction  of  the  respondents  on  traditional                       business;  (5)  determine the  significant  difference  between the  respondents’  level  of                       satisfaction  on  e-commerce  and  traditional  business;  (6)  determine  the  significant                       difference  on  the  respondents’  level  of  satisfaction  on  e-commerce  when  grouped                       according to profile; and (7) determine the significant difference on the respondents’                       level  of  satisfaction  on  traditional  business  when  grouped  according  to  profile.                       Descriptive method was used in the study. The researcher will use the self-made survey                       questionnaire which was prepared for 384 respondents based on the 689,992 population.

This  suggests  that                           educational  institutions  should  function  in  ways  that  do  not  impose  or  perpetuate                           gender  stereotypes  that  exert  psychological  influence  and/or  promote  institutional                           barriers to the range of possibilities that boys and girls, men and women, can enjoy in                           relation to the education being offered.  This therefore relates to equality of treatment,                           which in turn is reflected in equality of outcome.                                   Increasing  attention  has  been  given  to  theimportance  of  achieving  gender                           equality  ineducation.  To  date,  however,  most  efforts  havefocused  on  addressing                           gender parity – an equalnumber or proportion of girls and boys accessingeducational                           opportunities.  Although  simple  genderparity  may  be  easier  to  measure,  gender                           equalityencompasses  a wider concept,  of which genderparity is  only  a part. Gender                           equality movesbeyond access and requires that girls and boys alsoexperience the same                           levels of quality andoutcomes of education.                                   Teaching, as a female dominated profession, mirrors the common stereotypes                           of  women  and  their  supposed  abilities.  Teaching  children  in  pre-elementary  and                           elementary schools, for example, is traditionally seen as an “extension to motherhood”                           and  therefore  a  “natural”  job  for  women  (equality@ei-ie.org,  2015).  Occupational                           gender  bias  further  lies  on  the  assumption  that  women  are  willing  to  take  orders,                           accept lower wages and are less prone to complain about working conditions (Anker,                           2001).                                  This  conferred  an  idea  to  further  pursue  exploration  about  issues  as  regards                           gender and development.  Gender sensitivity arose and augmented the awareness of                           every  individual  involved  in  school  settings.    Seminars,  trainings,  and  gender-                           responsive programs were continuously provided.  With this, educators then must be                           able to confirm to such changes, thus, will not only be gender-sensitive but gender-                           responsive.                                                                                                                  2","As  these  assumptions  reveal  massive  disadvantages  for  female  educators,  a                           study on gender-based differentiation among educators in Cavite may serve as basis                           for gender-responsive policies and projects.

(16)   Review of Related Literature                            Gender Analysis                                   Gender Analysis is the systematic gathering and examination of information on                           gender differences and social relations in order to identify, understand and re-address                           inequities based on gender. Reeves and Baden (2000), stated that gender analysis is a                           valuable  descriptive  and  diagnostic  tool  for  development  planners  and  crucial  to                           gender mainstreaming efforts. The components and methodology of gender analysis                           are shaped by how gender issues are understood.                                                                                                                6","The  role  of  gender  needs  is  very  important  in  gender  analysis.  Shared  and                           prioritized needs identified by women that arise from their common experiences as a                           gender and some women’s interests, of a political or practical nature, related to their                           experience  as  a  gendered  person.  Prioritized  concerns  have  been  translated  into  the                           concept  of  gender  needs  (Moser,  1989).  This  identifies  the  way  in  which  women’s                           gender  interests,  defined  by  women  themselves,  can  be  satisfied  in  the  planning                           process. Although needs and interests are conceptually different (Molyneux, 1998), in                           practice, they are closely related in the planning process. Needs, as well as interests,                           result from a political process of contestation and interpretation and thus should not be                           externally defined or seen as fixed.                            Needs for Gender Analysis                                    Practical Gender Needs (PGNs) according to Moser (1989) are the immediate                           needs  identified  by  women  to  assist  their  survival  in  their  socially  accepted  roles,                           within existing power structures. Policies to meet PGNs tend to focus on ensuring that                           women  and  their  families  have  adequate  living  conditions,  such  as  health  care  and                           food provision, access to safe water and sanitation, but also seek to ensure access to                           income-earning  opportunities.  PGNs  do  not  directly  challenge  gender  inequalities,                           even though these needs may be a direct result of women’s subordinate position in                           society.  Strategic  gender  needs  (SGNs),  are  those  needs  identified  by  women  that                           require  strategies  for  challenging  male  dominance  and  privilege.  These  needs  may                           relate  to  inequalities  in  the  gender  division  of  labor,  in  ownership  and  control  of                           resources, in participation in decision-making, or to experiences of domestic and other                           sexual  violence.  These  needs  are  often  seen  as  feminist  in  nature  as  they  seek  to                           change women’s status and position in society in relation to men. As such, they are                           more likely to be resisted than PGNs. In reality, it is difficult to distinguish so clearly                           between strategic and practical needs. Any policy or program may meet both sets of                           needs.  Through  collective  organizing  around  practical  gender  needs,  women  may                           achieve more strategic and transformatory goals. This politicization of practical gender                           needs  is  a  favored  entry  point  for  NGOs  and  women’s  organizations.  However,                           women  may  not  always  recognize  or  prioritize  their  strategic  gender  needs,                           particularly if it could threaten their immediate practical needs. At any time, gender                           interests may not be prioritized over women’s other interests which cut across these,                           such as those of class and race, so assumptions cannot be made of women’s solidarity.                           Gender Analysis for Education                                  Gender  analysis  is  a  critical  step  in  the  gendermainstreaming  of  legislation,                           policies andprogrammes and, in turn, in achieving genderequality. Gender analysis is                           necessary to determinethe existing gender balance, and to assess the wayin which a                           policy  or  programme  will  impact  womenand  men.  According  to  CIDA,  gender                           analysis“provides  an  understanding  of  the  different  impactthat  legislation,  cultural                           practices,  policies  andprograms  can  have  on  women  and  men”  (2007a).In  fact,  if  a                           gender  analysis  is  not  conducted  duringthe  design  of  a  policy  or  programme,  it                           mayinadvertently  increase  current  gender  inequalitiesor  lead  to  further  gender                           inequalities (Status ofWomen Canada, 2007).                                                                                                                 7","Gender  analysis  reveals  differences  in  women’sand  men’s  activities,                           conditions,  needs,  access  toand  control  over  resources  and  benefits,  as  well                           asdecision‐making  power  (UNESCO,  2005).Identifying  these  differences  can  help                           policymakersand programme managers understand why thedifferences exist and reveal                           entry points fordesigning policies and programmes that cansuccessfully address gender                           disparities andchallenge deeply ingrained systemic inequalities inorder to remove or                           reduce these obstacles togender equality.                                   Girls’ education is an “important entry point tobegin tackling gender inequality                           in  developingcountries”  (CIDA,  2003,  p.5).  Gender  equalitycannot  be  achieved  in                           schools without a focus onfull and equal access to a good quality educationfor both                           boys  and  girls  (UNESCO,  2000).  Whilemuch  progress  has  been  made  towards                           increasingfemale  enrolment  in  schooling,  many  girls  still  facecultural,  societal  and                           physical  barriers  to  attendingschool.  Increasing  girls’  access  to  education,however,                           does  not  necessarily  lead  to  thepromotion  of  gender  equality.  Longwe  notes                           thatschools  are  institutions  founded  on  a  dominantmale  culture  and  they  can                           advertently  orinadvertently  perpetuate  societal  genderinequalities  through  power                           relations withinschools, pedagogy and portrayal of male andfemale roles in textbook                           and learning materials(1998).                                   Gender  analysis  can  be  integral  to  understandingthe  gender  inequalities  that                           currently exist andpossible routes to removing and reducing them. Itcan bring to light                           areas  where  improvements  mustbe  made,  allowing  practitioners  and  researchers                           todevelop plans and policies to meet the needs oftheir unique context. This process can                           be aidedand scaffolded through the use of various frameworks.                            Gender Analysis Frameworks: A Comparative Overview                                  Gender analysis frameworks enable policymakersand practitioners to structure                           the  application  ofresearch  on  gender  and  conceptual  theory  intogender‐sensitive                           planning, design, implementation and monitoring and evaluation of developmentand                           education interventions. The frameworks aredesigned to ensure that gender needs and                           rolescan  be  identified,  addressed  and  monitored(Leach,  2003).  Although  the  most                           commonly  usedgender  analysis  frameworks  were  designed  toaddress  issues  in  the                           development  sector  morebroadly,  many  have  been  modified  recently  tomeet  the                           unique needs of the education field.  Ineducation, they have been particularly useful                           toidentify  issues  of  gender  bias  and  discrimination,and  to  assess  inequities  at  the                           classroom, schooland national levels.                                   This section provides an overview of the five keyframeworks that have been                           adapted  for  genderanalysis  in  education:  the  Harvard  AnalyticalFramework,  Moser                           Framework,  Gender  AnalysisMatrix,  Women’s  Empowerment  Framework,  andthe                           Social  Relations  Approach.  Each  of  theseframeworks  and  elements  of  many  of                           theseframeworks  have  been  altered,  combined  andimplemented  for  a  variety  of                           purposes  bypractitioners  and  policymakers  in  the  field  ofeducation.  The  following                           description brieflyhighlights some of the conceptual theories and theopportunities and                           challenges for implementationof gender analysis.                                                                                                                8","Before considering the utility of gender analysisframeworks in education, it is                           important for usersto keep in mind that each framework haslimitations and must be                           tailored to meet thecircumstances of a particular context. Most of thetools associated                           with the gender analysisframeworks can be adapted to a variety of levelsand stages.                           Yet, each is based on a certainapproach and set of values that need to beacknowledged                           by the user (Leach, 2003). Inaddition, gender analysis frameworks are not apanacea to                           the  issues  of  gender  inequality  indevelopment  or  education.  They  enable  the  userto                           better examine gender disparity, but withoutnecessarily revealing all of the underlying                           causes orconsequences related to men, women, boys andgirls. Rather than serving as                           an  end,  theframeworks  are  simply  a  “starting  point  forcollective  analysis  and                           discussion  and  for  theidentification  of  strategies  and  action  plans”(Leach,  p.  3).  As                           there  is  a  risk  of  over‐generalizingfindings,  it  is  imperative  that  the  frameworks                           beintegrated into a comprehensive gender strategy.                            Gender analysis frameworks                                  Harvard Analytical Framework.  The Harvard Analytical Framework is based                           on aneconomic argument for the analysis of access andcontrol of resources. Developed                           at the HarvardInstitute for International Development in 1985,the framework serves as                           a starting point in thedesign, implementation, or monitoring andevaluation process to                           reveal  implications  forwomen,  men,  girls  and  boys.  The  framework  hasbeen                           commonly  used  in  schools  to  reveal  formaland  informal  discrimination  and                           stereotyping. Itcan lead to raised awareness, discussion of thecauses and consequences                           of discrimination and,possibly, changes in policy and practice.                                   One of the limitations of the Harvard AnalyticalFramework is that it is “not                           aimed at gendertransformation but at an equitable share ofresources,  which in itself                           may not  help  women,”and may even be detrimental to  their position(Leach, p. 54).                           The framework does not focus onthe underlying causes of gender inequity, butrather                           argues for the inclusion of women as amechanism for efficiency. Unlike some of the                           laterframeworks,  it  does  not  examine  the  relationshipsbetween  those  of  different                           genders,  nor  does  itconnect  interventions  with  strategic  gender  goals.While  easy  to                           use, the tools can be overlysimplistic, which “distort the reality and underestimatethe                           complexity of most situations”(Leach, p. 54). The challenges of implementationalso                           include  facilitating  constructive  discussionsabout  findings,  designing  strategic  plans                           based ondata collected, and generating sex‐disaggregateddata when unavailable.                                   Women’s  Empowerment  Framework.  The  Women’s  Empowerment                           Framework,developed by Longwe in the late 1990s, is designedto assess commitment                           to  women’s  empowerment,the  existence  of  empowerment  in  the  contextbeing                           analysed,  and  the  impact  of  empowermenton  community  members.  In  this                           context,empowerment  relates  to  women’s  participationand  control  of  processes  and                           benefits. Theframework is based on the notion of four levels ofequality. In descending                           order  of  equality  controlthey  are:  participation,  conscientisation,  accessand  welfare                           (Leach, 2003). This frameworkadvances on the categories determined in theHarvard                           framework  by  creating  a  hierarchy  formeasurement.  It  should  be  noted  that  lower                                                                                                                9","levelsdo  not  need  to  be  achieved  for  higher  levels  ofequality,  but  users  should                           maintain realisticexpectations when designing interventions.                                   One of the limitations of this framework is that itprovides a static picture of the                           situation  ratherthan  measuring  change  over  time.  Like  the  HarvardAnalytical                           Framework,  it  lacks  complexity  and  failsto  address  gender  relations.  Furthermore,                           thehierarchy of equality provided in the frameworktool does not necessarily provide a                           realistic view ofthe context.                                   Moser  Framework.  The  Moser  Framework,  developed  by  CarolineMoser  at                           the  Development  Planning  Unit  of  theUniversity  of  London,  is  often  used  in                           conjunctionwith  the  Harvard  Analytical  Framework  to  betterunderstand  the  way  in                           which productive,reproductive and community work can impact thegender division of                           labour. It specifically focuses on“integrating gender in all types of intervention, andto                           confront  power  relations  in  organizations,communities,  and  social  institutions”                           (Moser,1999, p. 55). The framework assumes a morenuanced view of gender planning                           by arguing that itis political as well as technical, and that conflictsexist in the planning                           process.  The  approachintroduces  the  idea  of  the  triple  role  of  women  inproductive,                           reproductive  and  community  work  andaims  to  examine  the  implications  that  these                           roleshave  on  women’s  participation  in  the  developmentprocess.  Moser  makes  a                           distinction betweenpractical needs or the needs that women or girlswould themselves                           identify based on their existingposition in society – for example, health services –and                           strategic  needs  or  needs  that  challenge  theirsubordinate  position  in  society,  such  as                           legalrepresentation. These categories have beenapplied in education to recognize and                           identify theneeds of girls regarding their access to and theprocess of schooling.                                   This  framework  has  been  criticized  for  itsterminology  and  design.  For                           example, the term‘role’, used to describe the various work ofwomen, is said to ignore                           the  unequal  powerdisparity  between  genders.  Like  many  of  the  otherframeworks,  it                           does  not  allow  users  to  understandthe  often‐intersecting  forms  of  inequality,  such                           asclass, disability or race (Moser, 1999). In addition,divisions between strategic and                           practical  needs  aresaid  to  create  an  unrealistic  dichotomy  that  doesnot  suit  the                           complicated needs of girls and womenin society.                                   Social  Relations  Approach.    The  Social  Relations  Approach,  developed  by                           NailaKabeer in the 1990s, is unique in that it focuses onsocial relations between men,                           women, boys andgirls, and their relationship to resources andactivities. The framework                           uses  a  social‐justice  lensto  examine  the  aspects  of  social  relations  sharedby                           institutions: rules, resources, people, activitiesand power. In many contexts, the Social                           Relationsframework can replace the Harvard framework,which will allow the user to                           move beyond merelythe identification of activities and access/control tohighlight other                           forms  of  marginalization  –  such  asclass,  ethnicity  and  race  –  that  can  exist                           inconjunction with gender.                                   In the education sector, the framework can beused to analyse education as a                           stand‐alone,  staterunservice,  as  well  as  its  relation  to  other  stateservices.  An                                                                                                               10","organizational‐level  analysis  can  beapplied  at  the  school  level  as  well.  Since  the                           SocialRelations Approach looks at inequality at a rangeof levels, it can be one of the                           more  complicatedframeworks  to  implement,  and  is  less  suited  for  aparticipatory                           methodology.  It  requires  users  topossess  a  detailed  understanding  of                           theinterdependence  of  institutions  and  the  ways  inwhich  they  perpetuate  gender                           inequality.                                   Gender  Analysis  Matrix.    One  of  the  unique  features  of  the  Gender                           AnalysisMatrix is that it measures impact over time. Ratherthan looking at the current                           situation  of  genderequality,  the  framework  asks  communities  toconsider  their                           expectations   for   an    intervention.   It   isspecifically   designed   so   that                           developmentpractitioners serve as facilitators, and communitymembers are believed to                           have the knowledge andexpertise necessary to carry out the analysis. Thematrix was                           designed  by  Rani  Parker  in  1993  andfeatures  four  levels  of  analysis:  women,                           men,household  and  community.  There  are  also  fourcategories  of  analysis:  labour,                           time,  resources  andculture.  Rather  than  emphasizing  overarchinggeneralities  or                           simplifying the causes of genderinequality, the matrix creates a space for dialogueon                           the issues of gender at the community level.                                   As the matrix is implemented on a reoccurringbasis, the facilitated discussions                           give rise tounexpected outcomes, issues or changes withinthe community. Because the                           focus  of  thisframework  is  to  mobilize  community  members  toassess  their  needs,  a                           well‐trained  facilitator  isparticularly  critical  for  effective  implementation,which  can                           serve  as  a  challenge.  In  addition,addressing  the  unexpected  issues  that  arise  is                           notalways  feasible,  particularly  in  resource-constrainedenvironments.  Finally,  the                           frameworkunrealistically  assumes  that  community  membersare  agreeable  to  one                           another and are able to workin a cooperative manner.                                   Comparing the frameworks.  As discussed earlier, the dominant approaches                           togender  analysis  have  been  the  WID  and  GADdiscourses,  which  emphasize                           efficiency  andempowerment,  respectively.  The  HarvardAnalytical  Framework  and                           Gender Analysis Matrixsubscribe to the efficiency approach to genderequality. On the                           other  hand,  the  Women’sEmpowerment  Framework  and  Social  RelationsApproach                           support  the  empowerment  claim,  whichargues  for  gender  equality  on  the  basis  of                           women’sagency. Given the varying approaches of the fiveframeworks, the emphasis                           on gender varies. TheHarvard Analytical Framework, Moser Frameworkand Women’s                           Empowerment Framework weredesigned to address women’s needs, unlike theGender                           Analysis  Matrix  and  Social  RelationsApproach,  which  examine  men’s                           activitiesalongside women’s.                                   The frameworks were also designed to addressdifferent levels of interventions.                           For example, theGender Analysis  Matrix  is  not particularly  useful fororganizational                           analysis,   but    can    be    effective    forproject‐level   interventions.   The                           Women’sEmpowerment  Framework  is  more  suited  toanalyse  projects  and                           programmes.  The  MoserFramework  and  the  Harvard  Analytical  Frameworkare                           suitable for planning at all levels. The SocialRelations Approach is designed for inter-                                                                                                               11","institutionalanalysis, where gender relations areassessed within the context of family,                           labourmarket,  community  and  state.  This  approach  canalso  be  adapted  to  assess  a                           single institution, justas all of the frameworks can be modified to fulfilthe objectives                           of researchers, practitioners andpolicymakers.                                   Local participation has become increasinglyemphasized in development work,                           andparticipation  is  also  underscored  in  the  genderanalysis  frameworks.  The                           participatory  approach  iscentral  to  the  Gender  Analysis  Matrix  andWomen’s                           Empowerment  Approach,  and  the  threeother  frameworks  can  be  modified  to                           varyingdegrees for participatory design andimplementation.                            Gender Roles                                   Reproductive.   As defined by Moser, this involves the care and maintenance                           of the household and its members, including bearing and caring for children, preparing                           food,  collecting  water  and  fuel,  shopping,  housekeeping,  and  family  health-care.  In                           poor communities, reproductive work is, for the most part, labor-intensive and time-                           consuming. It is almost always the responsibility of women and girls.                                   Filipino women, especially in rural areas, are traditionally bound to take care                           of  homes,  and  family  –  and  also  assist  in  productive  work  in  farms,  swiddens  and                           home gardens. Meanwhile, in self-subsistence indigenous areas, the women pound rice                           each day. The lack of technologies to aid in easing daily household chores, including                           rice pounding, effectively forces women to undertake strenuous activities even during                           their childbearing years. This greatly limits the engagement of women in productive                           employment, community activities and political affairs, and this is reinforced by the                           social norms that give prominence to men in these spheres.                                   Productive.  This  involves  the  production  of  goods  and  services  for                           consumption and trade (in employment and self-employment). Both women and men                           can be involved in productive activities, but their functions and responsibilities often                           differ.  Women's  productive  work  is  often  less  visible  and  less  valued  than  men's                           (March, et al. 2005).                                   Community.  These  activities  include  the  collective  organization  of  social                           events  and  services  -  ceremonies  and  celebrations,  activities  to  improve  the                           community, participation in groups and organizations, local political activities, and so                           on.  This  type  of  work  is  seldom  considered  in  economic  analyses,  yet  it  involves                           considerable volunteer time and is important for the spiritual and cultural development                           of  communities.  It  is  also  a  vehicle  for  community  organization  and  self-                           determination.  Both  women  and  men  engage  in  community  activities,  although  a                           gender division of labor also prevails here (March, et al. 2005).                                   Moser divides community work into two different types of work. Community-                           managing  activities  are  undertaken  primarily  by  women  as  an  extension  of  their                           reproductive  role.  Such  activities  ensure  the  provision  and  maintenance  of  scarce                                                                                                               12","resources  which  everyone  uses,  such  as  water,  healthcare,  and  education.  This  is                           voluntary unpaid work, carried out during women's 'free' time. Community politics are                           undertaken primarily by men, who take part in organized, formal politics, often within                           the  framework  of  national  politics.  They  are  usually  paid  in  cash  for  this  work,  or                           benefit indirectly through improved status or power (March, et al. 2005).                     (17)   Conceptual/Analytical Framework                                   The  study  will  use  the  Input-Process-Output-Outcome  Approach  in  order  to                            come up with gender-based policies, strategies, interventions, recommendations, and                            analysis in the education sector.                                   The inputs that will be considered will be the institutional profiles, household                            profiles,  triple  roles,  leisure  activities,  time  devoted  to  triple  roles  and  leisure                            activities, access to and control over resources and benefits, and the problems, needs,                            and constraints encountered.                                   Based on these primary data, gender analysis will be conducted to create sex-                            disaggregated data on the household profiles and access to and control over resources                            and  benefits;  and  differentiate  gender  roles  among  secondary  educators  in  general.                            Also, the identified problems, needs, and constraints among the participants will be                            the  basis  for  policy  formulation,  strategies,  interventions,  and  recommendations  in                            order  to  come  up  with  school-community  that  is  gender-responsive.                                                                                                                                                       13","","Figure 1.
