                       This module was primarily prepared to suit the needs of students of CvSU – Tanza
               Campus who are taking Analytic Geometry.   It emphasizes the essential elements of
               analytic geometry with special attention to those topics which are needed in a college
               level.  It has four chapters which include the Fundamental Concepts, the Straight Line,
               the Circle, and the Conic Sections.  These are the coverage of the 3-unit subject Math 5:
               Introduction to Analytic Geometry.

                       This text/workbook has the following features:

                       The learning targets are embodied in the What should you know component that
               specifies  the  skills  to  be  developed  and  serve  as  a  guide  for  the  learners  to  remain
               focused on the content of the instruction. This is written along with the introduction of the
               chapter.

                       How  much  do  you  know?  component  allows  learners  to  activate  their  prior
               knowledge of concepts and skills that will help them understand the lesson. This is written
               along with the introduction of the chapter.

                       Self-Check is an activity which helps learners to master the basic concepts, skills,
               and processes.

                       What will you do? component engages learners to investigate numerical aspects
               of real world experiences that can develop their creative and critical thinking skills. These
               skills can enhance their problem solving capabilities, make connections for meaningful
               learning,  communicate  and  demonstrate  understanding  of  concepts  and  skills,  and
               develop values of perseverance, hard work, cooperation, and the like in doing learning
               tasks alone or with others.

                       Try These is one which allows learners to apply various mathematical concepts
               and skills on higher level learning tasks.

                       Let’s Summarize is provided at the end of each module which summarizes ideas
               resulting from exploration activities.

                       Solutions and some illustrations to the examples are given in such a way that it can
               be easily understood by the students. These are also the bases in answering the set of
               exercises.

                       The formulas are presented in a manner that the students will be able to use them
               right away.

                       Exercises in each lesson intend to help the students develop their analytical skills in
               solving problems in Number Theory. These exercises are given for the students to do at
               their own pace.
                                                                                       Mildred A. Sebastian

                              College and Advanced Algebra as a course builds upon the students’ knowledge
                       on  properties  of  the  real  number  system,  operations  on  different  types  of  algebraic
                       expressions, and the solution of various types of equations and inequalities. The course
                       also covers the prerequisites to trigonometry and calculus, specifically transcendental and
                       non-transcendental  functions,  including  the  characteristics  of  their  graphs  and
                       applications.

                              This text has the following features:

                              What will you learn? is the component that specifies the skills to be developed
                       and serve as a guide for the learners to remain focused on the content of the instruction.
                       This is written along with the introduction of the chapter, What is the module about?.

                              What to do? elaborates on the tasks and/or activities that enable the learners to
                       comprehend  and  follow  the  procedures  for  effective  computational  fluency.  This
                       component  also  engages  learners  to  investigate  numerical  aspects  of  real  world
                       experiences that can develop their creative and critical thinking skills. These skills  can
                       enhance their problem solving capabilities, make connections for meaningful  learning,
                       communicate and demonstrate understanding of concepts and skills, and develop values
                       of perseverance, hard work, cooperation, and the like in doing learning tasks alone or with
                       others.

               Course Title



               Modern Geometry
               Course Description



               The  course  is  an  enrichment  of  the  Euclidean  Geometry.  It  discusses  the  properties  and
               applications of other types of geometries such as finite geometry, non-Euclidean geometry,

               and projective geometry.
               Course Goals/Objectives



               After completing this course, the students will be able to:
                   1.  demonstrate understanding of the 5th Postulate and how it led to the emergence of

                       other types of geometry;
                   2.  demonstrate  knowledge  of  the  similarities  and  differences  among  the  different
                       geometric types in terms of concepts, models, and properties with or without the use

                       of ICT tools;
                   3.  show  critical  thinking  and  logical  reasoning  in  using  the  axiomatic  method  when

                       constructing proofs for non-Euclidean geometric propositions; and
                   4.  demonstrate  understanding  of  mathematics  as  a  dynamic  field  relative  to  the
                       emergence of the different types of geometries.]]></page><page Index="12"><![CDATA[Course Calendar

                       This  module  presents  the  fundamentals  of  this  course.  It  begins  with  the  university  vision,
               mission, core values, and quality policy.
                       This learning material will be uploaded weekly, during the whole program of the semester. We
               hope that through this module, BSEM 30 – Modern Geometry, and other modes of learning, we could

               guarantee your safety without compromising quality education. May we serve our purpose and go an
               extra mile amidst this crisis.

                  “We don’t read and write poetry because it’s cute. We read and write poetry because we are the
                members of the human race. And the human race is filled with passion. And medicine, law, business,
                  engineering, these are noble pursuits and necessary to sustain life. But poetry, beauty, romance,

                                            love, these are what we stay alive for.”
                                                   -Dead Poet’s Society

                       We hope you find purpose throughout your journey in being an educator. May you never lack
               optimism and courage to pursue what your heart desires.  We can’t wait to see you on the field.
                       Stay safe and may your journey be filled with peace and gratitude.

               In  consideration  of  being  given  access  to  information  that  will  be  valuable  for  my  field  of

               specialization: Research, Modules, and Teaching materials provided by (Disclosing Party), I
               agree as follows:

               I shall treat with utmost confidentiality all the materials presented to me.

               I shall not disclose to anyone outside the Disclosing Party any information shared with me by
               the Disclosing Party.


               I shall not reproduced it for my own purposes or the benefit of anyone other than Disclosing

               Party without Disclosing Party’s prior written consent.

               My obligation to maintain the confidentiality and security of the Disclosing Party’s materials
               continues for so long as such material remains a trade secret.

               This  Agreement  expresses  the  complete  understanding  of  the  parties  with  respect  to  the
               subject  matter  and  supersedes  all  prior  proposals,  agreements,  representations,  and

               understandings. This Agreement may not be amended except in a writing signed by both the
               Disclosing Party and myself.

               I acknowledge that any misappropriation of any of the Confidential Information in violation of
               this Agreement may cause Disclosing Party irreparable harm, the amount of which may be

               difficult to ascertain, and therefore agree that Disclosing Party shall have the right to apply to
               a court of competent jurisdiction for an order enjoining any such further misappropriation and
               for such other relief as Disclosing Party deems appropriate.


               This  Agreement  shall  be  governed  in  accordance  with  the  laws  of  the  Republic  of  the

               Philippines.

               I have carefully read and considered all clauses of this Agreement and agree that all of the
               restrictions set forth are fair and reasonably required to protect the Disclosing Party’s interests.


               I have received a copy of this Agreement and with my signature agree to its terms.

                       This module presents the fundamentals of this course. This course focuses on child
               and adolescent development  with emphasis on current research and theory on biological,
               linguistic, cognitive, social, and emotional dimensions of development. Further, this includes
               factors that affect the progress of development of the learners and shall include appropriate
               pedagogical principles applicable for each developmental level.

                       This learning guide will help you discover some concepts on how to facilitate learner-
               centered teaching. The activities are designed so as to guide each learner, as well as the
               teacher, the facilitator of the learning, to make meaningful knowledge throughout the course.

                       It is our sincerest desire to extend our heartfelt gratitude to the CvSU T3 community,
               headed by Prof. Noel A. Sedigo for encouraging us to write instructional materials that will
               aide us in instruction.  Through this simple gestures of teaching-learning activities, we may
               be able to touch the lives of many prospective educators.

                       We hope you find purpose throughout your journey in being an educator. May you
               never lack optimism and courage to pursue what your heart desires. We can’t wait to see
               you on the field.

                                                         PREFACE


                       This  Laboratory  Manuel  in  Elementary  Statistics  was  written  as  an  aid  in  the  beginning
               statistics course to students whose mathematical background is limited to basic algebra. The manual
               complements  the  topics  discussed  in  the  lecture  part  of  the  Elementary  Statistics  course.  It
               summarizes and explains the concepts intuitively and supporting them with abundant exercises. The
               applications span a broad range of topics certain to appeal to the interests of  students of diverse
               backgrounds  and  include  problems  in  business,  sports,  health,  architecture,  education,
               entertainment, political science, psychology, history, criminal justice, the environment, transportation,
               physical sciences, demographics, eating habits, and travel and leisure.

                       This text has the following features:

                       What should you know? enlists the learning targets that specifies the skills to be developed
               and serve as a guide for the learners to remain focused on the content of the instruction.

                       What will you do? component engages learners to investigate numerical aspects of real
               world experiences that can develop their creative and critical thinking skills. These skills can enhance
               their  problem  solving  capabilities,  make  connections  for  meaningful  learning,  communicate  and
               demonstrate understanding of concepts and skills, and develop values of perseverance, hard work,
               cooperation, and the like in doing learning tasks alone or with others.

                       Some guide questions were written at the end of exercise to help the students generalize the
               key concepts in Statistics.

                       The formulas are presented in a manner that the students will be able to use them right away.
               Exercises in each lesson intend to help the students develop their analytical skills in solving problems
               in Statistics. These exercises are given for the students to do at their own pace.

                                                        Classification of Variables


                                                In any study, we identify the set of all entities or individuals being
                                         the subject of the study.  This set is called the population.  From the
                                         population, a variable can be defined.

                                                A variable is a characteristic or attribute of persons or objects
                                        which can assume different values or labels for different persons or
                                        objects under consideration.

                              A  variable  can  be  classified  as  quantitative  (takes  on  numerical  values  that
                       represent the amount) and qualitative (takes on categories and/or attributes).  In addition,
                       a quantitative variable may either be continuous (takes on any value on a given interval)
                       or discrete (takes on a countable number).

                              Measurement  is  the  process  of  determining  the  value  or  label  of  a  particular
                       variable for a particular experimental unit.

                              Levels of Measurement
                              1.  Nominal Level (Classificatory Scale)
                                         The nominal level is the weakest level of measurement where numbers
                                 or symbols are used simply for categorizing subjects into different groups.

                              2.  Ordinal Level (Ranking Scale)
                                         The  ordinal  level  of  measurement  contains  the  properties  of  the
                                 nominal  level,  and  in  addition,  the  numbers  assigned  to  categories  of  any
                                 variable may be ranked or ordered in some low-to-high manner.

                              3.  Interval Level
                                         The interval level is that which has the properties of the nominal and
                                 ordinal levels, and in addition, the distances between any two numbers on the
                                 scale are of known sizes.  An interval scale must have a common and constant
                                 unit of measurement.  Furthermore, the unit of measurement is arbitrary and
                                 there is no “true zero” point.

                              4.  Ratio Level
                                         The ratio level of measurement contains all the
                                 properties of the interval level, and in addition, it has a
                                 “true zero” point.

                       What should you know?

                              At the end of this exercise, the students must be able to:
                              1.  Identify the different types of variables
                              2.  Classify data according to the level of measurement

                                      RELATIONS AND FUNCTIONS


                       Relations  and  functions  are  two  different  things.    A  relation  is  a  set  of  ordered  pairs  of
               mathematical quantities; while a function  f  is a special type of a relation such that no two distinct
               ordered pairs have the same first number.
                       This module is an introduction to relations and functions.  It will discuss the difference between
               the two.  It will also help you create graphs of functions and interpret them.  The domain and range of the
               relations and functions shall likewise be discussed.

               Learning Targets

                       This module is written for you to help you:
                          1.  describe and differentiate relations and functions;
                          2.  determine domain and range using interval notation;
                          3.  sketch and interpret graph of functions and relations;
                          4.  distinguish function from a relation;
                          5.  perform operations on functions;
                          6.  classify functions; and
                          7.  apply concepts of functions on real-life problems.

               Get Ready
                       1.  Given the following ordered pairs, determine which denotes a function and a relation.
                          a.  {(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4), (5, 5), (6, 6)}



                          b.  {(2, -8), (1, -4), (0, -2), (0, 2), (1, 4), (2, 8)}




                       2.  Identify the domain and range of the above set of ordered pairs.

                       Number Theory is concerned with the properties of the set of integers.  Through
               this, we shall discuss the set of integers that cover Euclid’s algorithm, divisibility, unique
               factorization  theorem,  and  solutions  of  congruence  residue  system.    The  course  is
               basically axiomatic in nature and will focus on proving theorems and problem solving.

                       This  text  was  primarily  prepared  to  suit  the  needs  of  students  who  are  taking
               Number  Theory.      It  emphasizes  the  essential  elements  of  arithmetic  with  special
               attention  to  those  topics  which  are  needed  in  a  college  level.    It  has  four  chapters
               which  include  the  Methods  of  Proof,  Divisibility  and  Special  Number,  Linear
               Congruence, and Linear Diophantine Equations.  These are the coverage of the 3-unit
               subject Math 105: Number Theory.

                       This text has the following features:

                       Learning Targets is the component that specifies the skills to be developed and
               serve as a guide for the learners to remain focused on the content of the instruction.
               This is written along with the introduction of the chapter.

               concepts and skills that will help them understand the lesson.  This is written along with
               the introduction of the chapter.

                       Self-Check is an activity which helps learners to master the basic concepts, skills,
               and processes.

                       Explore  component  engages  learners  to  investigate  numerical  aspects  of  real
               world experiences that can develop their creative and critical thinking skills.  These skills
               can  enhance  their  problem  solving  capabilities,  make  connections  for  meaningful
               learning,  communicate  and  demonstrate  understanding  of  concepts  and  skills,  and
               develop values of perseverance, hard work, cooperation, and the like in doing learning
               tasks alone or with others.

                       Practice Your Skills is one which allows learners to apply various mathematical
               concepts and skills on higher level learning tasks.

                       Summary  of  the  chapter  is  provided  at  the  end  of  each  chapter  which
               summarizes ideas resulting from exploration activities.
                       Reflection  part  provides  learners  the  opportunity  to  express  in  writing  their
               thoughts  and  feelings  about  their  learning  experiences  and  become  aware  of  their
               own mathematical thinking.  This is written at the end of each chapter.

                  MATHEMATICS AROUND US is a series of mathematics books aligned
             to the K-12 mathematics curriculum prescribed by the Department of
             Education. Evolved from experiences, observation, and learning theory,
             the lessons were designed to engage students in active learning that
             develops critical thinking leading to successful problem solving.
                  The components of each lesson are listed below. Each lesson consists
             of the topics focusing on the competencies to be learned and to be
             mastered as well.





                    Learning Targets
                       This component specifies the skills to be developed and serve as
                  a  guide  for  the  learners  to  remain  focused  on  the  content  of  the
                  instruction.

                       It allows learners to activate their prior knowledge of concepts
                  and skills that will help them understand the lesson.





                    Explore
                       This engages learners to investigate the numerical aspects of real
                  world experiences that can develop their creative and critical thinking

                  skills. These  skills can  enhance  their  problem  solving capabilities,
                  make  connections  for  meaningful  learning,  communicate  and
                  demonstrate  understanding  of concepts  and skills,  and develop
                  values of perseverance,  hard work,  cooperation,  and the  like in
                  doing learning tasks alone or with others. In this section of the lesson,
                  the learners will  make use of concrete materials  as  applicable
                  representations,  and other  forms  of  visual  aid that  will help them
                  construct their mathematical ideas and understanding.

                  MATHEMATICS  AROUND  US is a series of  mathematics textbooks
             aligned to the K to 12  mathematics curriculum prescribed by the
             Department of Education. Evolved from experiences, observations, and
             learning theories, the lessons were designed to engage students in active
             learning that  develops critical thinking  leading to  successful problem
             solving.
                  The components of each lesson are listed below. Each lesson consists
             of the topics focusing on the competencies to be learned and to be

             mastered as well.




                    Learning Targets
                    This component specifies the skills to be developed and serve as
                  a  guide  for  the  learners  to  remain  focused  on  the  content  of  the
                  instruction.




                   Get Ready

                    It allows learners to activate their prior knowledge of concepts and
                  skills that will help them understand the lesson.





                     Explore
                    This engages learners to investigate the numerical aspects of real

                  world experiences that can develop their creative and critical thinking
                  skills. These  skills can  enhance  their  problem  solving capabilities,
                  make  connections  for  meaningful  learning,  communicate  and
                  demonstrate  understanding  of concepts  and skills,  and develop
                  values of perseverance,  hard work,  cooperation,  and the  like in
                  doing learning tasks alone or with others. In this section of the lesson,
                  the learners will  make use of concrete materials  as  applicable
                  representations,  and other  forms  of  visual  aid that  will help them
                  construct their mathematical ideas and understanding.




                                                                                                          iii

                 This component  summarizes ideas resulting  from  exploration
               activities.





                 Check Your Understanding
                 This activity helps learners to master the basic concepts, skills, and
               processes.





                   Practice Your Skills
                 It allows learners to apply various mathematical concepts and skills
               on higher level learning tasks.





                   Practice More

                 It allows learners to apply various mathematical concepts and skills
               in more challenging situations, which may include extended learning
               tasks outside the classroom.





                  Reflect
                 This part provides learners the opportunity to express in writing their
               thoughts and feelings about their learning experiences and become
               aware of their own mathematical thinking.

               This series provides a strong foundation in mathematics as it is

           designed to provide the concepts and skills needed in a spiral manner.
           Thus, the learners will be prepared to understand mathematics concepts
           and skills, hone their thinking ability, and become more efficient problem
           solvers in the long run.

                  MATHEMATICS  AROUND  US is a series of  mathematics textbooks
             aligned to the K to 12  mathematics curriculum prescribed by the
             Department of Education. Evolved from experiences, observations, and
             learning theories, the lessons were designed to engage students in active
             learning that  develops critical thinking  leading to  successful problem
             solving.
                  The components of each lesson are listed below. Each lesson consists

             of the topics focusing on the competencies to be learned and to be
             mastered as well.




                    Learning Targets
                    This component specifies the skills to be developed and serve as
                  a  guide  for  the  learners  to  remain  focused  on  the  content  of  the
                  instruction.




                   Get Ready

                    It allows learners to activate their prior knowledge of concepts and
                  skills that will help them understand the lesson.





                     Explore

                    This engages learners to investigate the numerical aspects of real
                  world experiences that can develop their creative and critical thinking
                  skills. These  skills can  enhance  their  problem  solving capabilities,
                  make  connections  for  meaningful  learning,  communicate  and
                  demonstrate  understanding  of concepts  and skills,  and develop
                  values of perseverance,  hard work,  cooperation,  and the  like in
                  doing learning tasks alone or with others. In this section of the lesson,
                  the learners will  make use of concrete materials  as  applicable
                  representations,  and other  forms  of  visual  aid that  will help them

                  construct their mathematical ideas and understanding.





                                                                                                          iii

               on higher level learning tasks.





                   Practice More

                 It allows learners to apply various mathematical concepts and skills
               in more challenging situations, which may include extended learning
               tasks outside the classroom.





                  Reflect
                 This part provides learners the opportunity to express in writing their
               thoughts and feelings about their learning experiences and become
               aware of their own mathematical thinking.

               This series provides a strong foundation in mathematics as it is

           designed to provide the concepts and skills needed in a spiral manner.
           Thus, the learners will be prepared to understand mathematics concepts
           and skills, hone their thinking ability, and become more efficient problem
           solvers in the long run.


                                                                                            The Authors

                  MATHEMATICS AROUND US is a series of mathematics textbooks aligned to the K
             to 12 mathematics curriculum prescribed by the Department of Education. Evolved
             from  experiences,  observations,  and  learning  theories,  the  lessons were  designed
             to  engage  students  in  active learning  that  develops critical thinking  leading to
             successful problem solving.
                  The  components  of  each  lesson are  listed below.  Each lesson consists of  the
             topics focusing on the competencies to be learned and to be mastered as well.




                    Learning Targets

                           This component specifies the skills to be developed and serve as a guide
                       for the learners to remain focused on the content of the instruction.




                   Get Ready

                           It allows learners to activate their prior knowledge of concepts and skills
                       that will help them understand the lesson.




                     Explore

                           This engages learners to investigate the numerical aspects of real world
                       experiences that can develop their creative and critical thinking skills. These
                       skills  can enhance  their  problem solving capabilities,  make connections
                       for  meaningful  learning,  communicate  and demonstrate  understanding
                       of  concepts and skills,  and develop values of  perseverance,  hard  work,
                       cooperation, and the like in doing learning tasks alone or with others. In this
                       section of the lesson, the learners will  make use of concrete materials as
                       applicable representations, and other forms of visual aid that will help them

                       construct their mathematical ideas and understanding.




                    Mathematical Ideas

                           This component summarizes ideas resulting from exploration activities.








                                                                                                          iii
                                                                                                          iii]]></page><page Index="63"><![CDATA[Check Your Understanding

                         This  activity helps learners  to  master  the  basic concepts,  skills, and
                    processes.





                   Practice Your Skills
                         It allows learners to apply various mathematical concepts and skills on

               Probability and Statistics is one of the most interesting, yet the most challenging subjects
            in senior high school. Through this, students will be able to explore the mean and variance
            of a random variable, to apply sampling techniques and distributions, to estimate population
            mean and proportion, to perform hypothesis testing on population mean and proportion,
            and to perform correlation and regression analyses on real-life problems. All these are aimed
            towards the development of critical thinking and problem-solving which are the twin goals
            of mathematics education in the Philippines.

               This text/workbook is primarily prepared to suit the needs of students who are taking
            Probability and Statistics courses. It emphasizes the essential elements of Probability and
            Statistics with special attention to those competencies which are needed in senior high school
            level. This subject likewise prepare students to effectively undertake quantitative researches.
            It  has  six  chapters  which  include  the  Random  Variables  and  Probability  Distributions,
            Normal Distribution, Sampling and Sampling Distributions, Estimation of Parameters, Tests
            of Hypothesis, and Correlation and Regression Analyses. The last chapter is an enrichment
            chapter wherein students are enjoined to perform correlation analyses in real-life problems
            in different fields.
               This text/workbook has the following features:
               Learning Targets is the component that specifies the skills to be developed and serve
            as a guide for the learners to remain focused on the most important concepts to be learned.
               Get Ready component allows learners to activate their prior knowledge of concepts and
            skills that will help them understand the lesson.







                                                                                          iii]]></page><page Index="72"><![CDATA[Let’s Explore engages learners to investigate the use of the lesson in real world experi-
           ences which can help develop their creative and critical thinking skills. These skills can
           enhance their problem solving capabilities and enable them to demonstrate understanding
           of concepts and skills. It also aid in developing values of perseverance, hard work, cooperation,
           and the like in doing learning tasks.
               Let’s Summarize summarizes ideas from exploration activities.
               Let’s Try is an activity which helps learners to master the basic concepts, skills, and
           processes. This is coupled with guide questions and discussions of answers.
               Let’s Practice is one which allows learners to apply various mathematical concepts and
           skills on higher level learning tasks independently.
               Let’s Reflect part provides learners the opportunity to express in writing their thoughts
           and feelings about their learning experiences and become aware of their own mathematical
           thinking. This is written at the end of each lesson.
               Solutions and some illustrations to the examples are given in such a way that it can be
           easily understood by the students. These are also the bases in answering the set of exercises.
           The formulas are presented in a manner that the students will be able to use them right away.

               Exercises in each lesson intend to help the students develop their analytical skills in
           solving problems in Probability and Statistics. These exercises are given for the students to
           do at their own pace.
                                                                              —The Authors
