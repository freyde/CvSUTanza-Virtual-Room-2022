Evolved from experiences, observation, and learning theory,              the lessons were designed to engage students in active learning that              develops critical thinking leading to successful problem solving.                   The components of each lesson are listed below. Each lesson consists              of the topics focusing on the competencies to be learned and to be              mastered as well.                          Learning Targets                        This component specifies the skills to be developed and serve as                   a  guide  for  the  learners  to  remain  focused  on  the  content  of  the                   instruction.                        Get Ready                         It allows learners to activate their prior knowledge of concepts                   and skills that will help them understand the lesson.                          Explore                        This engages learners to investigate the numerical aspects of real                   world experiences that can develop their creative and critical thinking                    skills. These  skills can  enhance  their  problem  solving capabilities,                   make  connections  for  meaningful  learning,  communicate  and                   demonstrate  understanding  of concepts  and skills,  and develop                   values of perseverance,  hard work,  cooperation,  and the  like in                   doing learning tasks alone or with others. In this section of the lesson,                   the learners will  make use of concrete materials  as  applicable                   representations,  and other  forms  of  visual  aid that  will help them                   construct their mathematical ideas and understanding.                                                                                                                 iii","Mathematical Ideas                     This component  summarizes ideas resulting  from  exploration                activities.                       Check Your Understanding                     This activity helps learners to master the basic concepts, skills,                and processes.                       Practice Your Skills                      It allows learners to apply various mathematical concepts and                skills on higher level learning tasks.                          Practice More                     It allows learners to apply various mathematical concepts and                skills in more challenging situations, which may include extended                learning tasks outside the classroom.                       Reflect                     This part provides learners the opportunity to express in writing                their thoughts and feelings about their learning experiences and                become aware of their own mathematical thinking.

Evolved from experiences, observations, and              learning theories, the lessons were designed to engage students in active              learning that  develops critical thinking  leading to  successful problem              solving.                   The components of each lesson are listed below. Each lesson consists              of the topics focusing on the competencies to be learned and to be               mastered as well.                         Learning Targets                     This component specifies the skills to be developed and serve as                   a  guide  for  the  learners  to  remain  focused  on  the  content  of  the                   instruction.                        Get Ready                      It allows learners to activate their prior knowledge of concepts and                   skills that will help them understand the lesson.                           Explore                     This engages learners to investigate the numerical aspects of real                    world experiences that can develop their creative and critical thinking                   skills. These  skills can  enhance  their  problem  solving capabilities,                   make  connections  for  meaningful  learning,  communicate  and                   demonstrate  understanding  of concepts  and skills,  and develop                   values of perseverance,  hard work,  cooperation,  and the  like in                   doing learning tasks alone or with others. In this section of the lesson,                   the learners will  make use of concrete materials  as  applicable                   representations,  and other  forms  of  visual  aid that  will help them                   construct their mathematical ideas and understanding.                                                                                                               iii                                                                                                           iii","Mathematical Ideas                   This component  summarizes ideas resulting  from  exploration                activities.

Evolved from experiences, observations, and              learning theories, the lessons were designed to engage students in active              learning that  develops critical thinking  leading to  successful problem              solving.                   The components of each lesson are listed below. Each lesson consists               of the topics focusing on the competencies to be learned and to be              mastered as well.                         Learning Targets                     This component specifies the skills to be developed and serve as                   a  guide  for  the  learners  to  remain  focused  on  the  content  of  the                   instruction.                        Get Ready                      It allows learners to activate their prior knowledge of concepts and                   skills that will help them understand the lesson.                           Explore                      This engages learners to investigate the numerical aspects of real                   world experiences that can develop their creative and critical thinking                   skills. These  skills can  enhance  their  problem  solving capabilities,                   make  connections  for  meaningful  learning,  communicate  and                   demonstrate  understanding  of concepts  and skills,  and develop                   values of perseverance,  hard work,  cooperation,  and the  like in                   doing learning tasks alone or with others. In this section of the lesson,                   the learners will  make use of concrete materials  as  applicable                   representations,  and other  forms  of  visual  aid that  will help them                    construct their mathematical ideas and understanding.                                                                                                                iii                                                                                                           iii","Mathematical Ideas                   This component  summarizes ideas resulting  from  exploration                activities.                       Check Your Understanding                  This activity helps learners to master the basic concepts, skills, and                processes.

Evolved              from  experiences,  observations,  and  learning  theories,  the  lessons were  designed              to  engage  students  in  active learning  that  develops critical thinking  leading to              successful problem solving.                   The  components  of  each  lesson are  listed below.  Each lesson consists of  the              topics focusing on the competencies to be learned and to be mastered as well.                         Learning Targets                             This component specifies the skills to be developed and serve as a guide                        for the learners to remain focused on the content of the instruction.                        Get Ready                             It allows learners to activate their prior knowledge of concepts and skills                        that will help them understand the lesson.                          Explore                             This engages learners to investigate the numerical aspects of real world                        experiences that can develop their creative and critical thinking skills. These                        skills  can enhance  their  problem solving capabilities,  make connections                        for  meaningful  learning,  communicate  and demonstrate  understanding                        of  concepts and skills,  and develop values of  perseverance,  hard  work,                        cooperation, and the like in doing learning tasks alone or with others. In this                        section of the lesson, the learners will  make use of concrete materials as                        applicable representations, and other forms of visual aid that will help them                         construct their mathematical ideas and understanding.
