These slots will be distributed per college/campus                      proportional  to  the  number  of  faculty  researchers  and/or  approved  researches.  A                     faculty member can avail funding for paper presentation only once per year whether it                     is  in  an  international  or  local  conference  to  give  chance to  other  deserving  faculty                     members.

The  Knowledge  Management  Center  will  determine  the  completeness  of  the                         submitted  requirements  of  all  requests  for  funding.  Only  those  with  complete                         submissions will be processed.                      2.      In  coordination  with  the  Research  Center,  KMC  will  verify  if  the  paper  has                         undergone proper monitoring and evaluation particularly if it has been presented                         to the Annual Agency In-House Review.                     3.   The Center will then check if the slots allotted for the College/Campus/Unit has not                         yet been used up.                     4.    The Center will then notify the faculty member of the results of their application                          not more than three (3) working days from the date of submission of complete                         requirements.

Knowledge management may involve faculty, student, staff, and third-                     party authors and inventors. It often takes the form of intellectual property which can                     be further developed and/or shared with others, locally, nationally, and globally, for                     further societal benefit and commercialization.","24                             This set of policies seeks to protect the interests of both inventors, creators and                     CvSU, while also ensuring that the community and society benefit from the fair and full                     dissemination of knowledge and innovation.                            This set of policies seeks to provide guidelines that can be consistently applied                      to facilitate the incubation and/or commercialization of research outputs and to arrive                     at  reasonable  solutions  to  possible  IP  issues  relating  to  the  conduct  of  research,                     incubation, and knowledge and technology transfer.                            Nothing in this policy relieves CvSU of the obligation of adhering to Philippine                     Law or CvSU contracts, including Research Agreements.                             Section 1. General Principles                                   Section  1.1  The  university  resources  should  be  used  for  University                            purposes and not for personal gain or personal commercial advantage nor for                            any  other  non-University  purposes.  The  University  subscribes  to  a  policy                            recognizing the academic practice of treating faculty members as owners of                            inventions, works and other intellectual creations they generate without the use                            of  University  and/or  third  party  funding,  and  without  the  use  of  substantial                             University and/or third party resources, which are not ordinarily available to all                            faculty for traditional academic purposes which includes teaching, research,                            and extension work.                                   Section  1.2.  The  University  encourages  the  faculty’s full  freedom  in                            research  and  in  the  publication  of  their  results  subject  to  the  adequate                             performance of their other academic duties.                                   Section 1.3. The University acknowledges that its efforts to generate                            income  should  be  weighed  against  its  principal  responsibility  to  provide  a                            favorable  environment  to  explore  knowledge  for  the  benefit  of  the  public  in                            general;  and","25                                    Section 1.4. The University accepts that in some cases, the recognition                            of Intellectual Property (IP) Rights of authors and inventors are effective ways                            to ensure accountability and accessibility of knowledge and technologies.

Section 3.
