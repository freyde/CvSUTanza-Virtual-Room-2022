Thesis  in  the  graduate  and  undergraduate  levels  as  well  as  in  the                    laboratory school are expensive and need some forms of financial support                    in pursuing student’s researches with improved quality of output.                     Faculty  research  project  may  also  accommodate  and  fund  thesis  of                    students.                      Students and faculty members need to expose and be more confident and                    in coming up with quality of outputs.                     There  is  need  for  the  colleges  to  identify  workable  and  doable  research                    thrust, agenda and program that will serve as guide in implementing the                    research activities of the university.

Rationale                            Republic  Act  No.  8293,  otherwise  known  as  the  Intellectual                    Property Code of the Philippines, states that:                             “The  State  recognizes  that  an  effective  intellectual  and  industrial                    property  system  is  vital  to  the  development  of  domestic  and  creative                    activity,  facilitates  transfers  of  technology,  attracts  foreign  investments,                    and ensures market access for our products.  It shall protect and secure                    the  exclusive  rights  of  scientist,  inventors,  artists  and  other  gifted                    citizens  to  their  intellectual  property  and  creations,  particularly  when                    beneficial to the people.”                             With  the  various  intellectual  properties  (IP’s)  developed  in  the                    university  such  as  the  Aguinaldo  Blend  Coffee,  processed  products,                    design  for  biogas  digester  and  innumerable  research  outputs  being                    presented  for  public  consumption,  a  few  of  them  were  able  to  acquire                    protection. The biogas digester was just recently granted a patent, while                    research  outputs/publications  have  been  presented  without  copyright                    protection,  except  for  some  that  were  able  to  acquire  ISBN  registration                    from  the  National  Library.  Therefore,  the  University  must  develop  a                    system  for  protecting  economically  viable  intellectual  properties  to                    maximize gains that could finance more researches in the future.
