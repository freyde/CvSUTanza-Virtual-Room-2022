                                                B.  TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION
          Rationale:
                                  Employability  is  more  than  merely  getting  a  job  but  implies  a  set  of
                           achievement  in  terms  of  skills,  understandings  and  personal  attributes.  Developing
                           competent graduates whose skills and capabilities can readily respond to the dynamic
                           needs of the industry is a vital role of higher education institutions (HEIs).  HEIs are
                           challenged  to  evaluate  their  curriculum  to  ensure  the  fit  between  graduate
                           competencies  and  those  required  by  employers,  stressing  on  specific  and  well-
                           targeted  skills  to  guarantee  an  effective job market placement  of  its  graduates.   In
                           addition, Javier (2018) reiterated that graduates should have gained the appropriate
                           competencies  and  skills  in  their  field  of  specialization  upon  graduation  and  before
                           applying to the workplace of their choice.

                                  One  way  of  evaluating  the  results  of  education  and  training  provided  in  the
                           HEIs is the conduct of a graduate tracer study.  It is an efficient mechanism to monitor
                           graduates’  employability,  evaluate  their  workplace  performance,  and  establish  the
                           effectiveness  and  responsiveness  of  curricular  programs  offered  in  any  HEI.    Data
                           generated  from  the  tracer  study  could  re-evaluate  the  factors  affecting  and
                           contributing to the status of employment of graduates.

                                  Cavite State University – Tanza Campus, being a primary tertiary education in
                           the municipality of Tanza, Cavite, aims to ensure that graduates of the campus have
                           extensive  education  and  training  for  them  to  be  equipped  with  competencies,
                           knowledge and skills in their field of study and be prepared to become part of their
                           chosen industry.  In order for the campus to monitor its graduates on a periodic basis,
                           the conduct  of  tracer study  is necessary.    Hence,  a  graduate  tracer study  is  being
                           proposed  to  determine  the  workplace  performance  of  CvSU  –  Tanza  Campus
                           graduates.  Consequently,  the  study  could  provide  insights  about  the  level  of
                           workplace  preparedness  and  attitude  of  its  graduates  as  well  as  the  employers’
                           satisfaction  on  the  workplace  performance  and  attitudes.  In  addition,  the  study  will
                           also determine the relevance and responsiveness of CvSU – TC curricular programs
                           to the needs of the industry based on its graduates’ quality of performance. Moreover,
                           the  results  of  the  findings  will  serve  as  significant  inputs  to  the  curriculum
                           development of the University to meet local and global demands for a highly skilled
                           labor force.


          Objectives:               The industry relies so much on higher education institutions in training and
                           preparing graduates for the workplace.  Due to this, higher education institutions find
                           ways to make their curriculum responsive to the needs of the industry. Cavite State
                           University – Tanza finds it crucial to ensure that effective and efficient programs are
                           provided  to  produce  a  human  workforce  capable  of  contributing  to  national
                           development.  Thus,  this  study  will  be  conducted  to  determine  the  workplace
                           performance  of  CvSU  –  Tanza  graduates.  Furthermore,  it  also  aims  to  develop  a
                           graduate tracer mobile application and information system that can be used by the
                           office of student affairs and services to find required alumni data which can be used
                           for accreditation and other purposes.

                                  The  four  component  studies  are  specifically  done  to  obtain  answers  to  the
                           following objectives:

                                      Industry Needs

                                    1.  Characterize CvSU-Tanza graduates’ workplace performance as
                                       perceived by employers in terms of:
                                       k.  Effective Communication Skills;
                                       l.  Self-awareness;
                                       m.  Critical Thinking Skills;
                                       n.  Data Analyzing Skills and Use of Technology;
                                       o.  Problem Solving;
                                       p.  Working Effectively with others;
                                       q.  Initiative and Enterprise Development;
                                       r.  Self-management;
                                       s.  Social responsibility;
                                       t.  Professionalism; and

                                    2.  Determine the relevance and responsiveness of curricular programs as
                                       perceived by CvSU – Tanza Graduates and their respective employers in
                                       terms of:
                                       a.  attainment of program objectives;
                                       b.  adequacy of quality training in preparing students;
                                       c.  adequacy of course experience;

                                    3.  Determine the level of attainment of CvSU-Tanza curricular program
                                       objectives based on the employers’ perception of CvSU-Tanza
                                       graduates’ workplace performance; and

                                    4.  Recommend intervention activities to improve curricular programs based
                                       on graduates’ and employer’s feedback.

          Literature:          Graduate competencies and employability
                                      Studies have attempted to unpack the demand of competencies at work in
                               relation  to  how  they  contribute  to  work  readiness,  profitability  and  work
                               performance (Pang et al., 2018). Fleming et al. (2009) conducted a study among
                               industrial supervisors, students and graduates, who rated 24 competencies. They
                               found that ‘ability and willingness to learn’, ‘initiative’ and ‘personal planning and
                               organizational skills’ bore the highest ratings among the competencies students
                               needed  to  master  before  starting  their  cooperative  educational  experiences.  In
                               response  to  a  survey  of  employers  conducted  in  Scotland,  ‘trustworthiness’,
                               ‘reliability’,  ‘motivation’,  ‘communication  skills’  and  ‘willingness  to  learn’  were
                               considered  the  most  important  transferable  skills  when  hiring  graduates
                               (McMurray et al., 2016).
                                      According to Abas and Imam in 2016, one critical measure of success in
                               workplaces is an employee’s ability to use competently the knowledge, skills and
                               values that match the needs of his job, satisfy the demands of his employer, and
                               contribute to the overall achievement of institutional goals.

                               Employers’ views on graduate competencies
                                      Deaconu  et  al.  (2014)  reported  that  employers  were  most  satisfied  with
                               graduates’  abilities  in  ‘assuming  responsibility’,  ‘efficient  activity  planning  and
                               organization’  and  ‘promptness  and  efficient  time  management’.  The  results  of
                               content-analysed  data  collected  through  critical  incident  interviews  on
                               competencies by Ryan et al. (2012) indicate that the presence of skills in ‘team
                               leadership’,  ‘achievement  orientation’,  ‘developing  others’  and  ‘impact  and
                               influence on others’ predicts business profitability.
                                      Employers  require  graduates  to  have  the  fundamental  technical  skills
                               necessary for their specific professions (Low et al., 2016). However, beyond that,
                               studies  have  found  that  soft  skills  have  been  receiving  greater  attention  in
                               organizations (Stewart et al., 2016) and higher education (Pang and Hung, 2012).
                               Based on data gathered from job advertisements placed in the careers section of
                               newspapers, Dunbar et al. (2016) found that employers placed greatest emphasis
                               on soft skills and discussed technical skills to a lesser extent. Further supporting
                               this hypothesis, an online survey conducted in the United Kingdom concluded that
                               human  resource  professionals  were  very  impressed  with  graduates’  technical
                               skills, but expressed concerns about their soft skills and attributes (Poon, 2014). A
                               study  soliciting  comments  from  the  Romanian  labour  market  revealed  that
                               employers viewed transversal competencies as more important than professional
                               ones (Deaconu et al., 2014). In a study surveying 143 organizations, Jackson and
                               Chapman (2012) found that students were confident and proficient on technical
                               aspects but significantly deficient in managerial skill sets.

                               Current conceptualizations of graduate work readiness
                                      The evident lack of clarity and consensus on what defines work readiness
                               may be due to the fact  that, as  a  construct, it  is  still  in  the  early  stages  of
                               development.    The  emergence  of interest  in work  readiness can  be  linked  to
                               the  increasing  demand  from  employers  for graduates to possess a diverse
                               range of generic graduate attributes or generic skills (Hager &  Holland,  2006).
                               This    trend    has    resulted    from   economic    and    technological    developments
                               which  have  significantly  changed  the  nature  of  the  workplace.    The  term
                               generic    skills    is  used    interchangeably    with    related    terms    including    “core
                               skills”,  “basic  skills”,  “transferable skills”  and  “employability  skills”.    It  refers
                               to  a  range  of  qualities  and  capacities  that  are viewed as important in the
                               preparation  for  work  in  almost  any  job.    Examples  of  generic  skills  include
                               communication, problem solving and working with others.   Alternatively,  Hager
                               and Holland  argue  that  generic  graduate attributes  go  beyond  technical  skills
                               to  also  include attitudes,  values  and  dispositions.   The various combinations of
                               attributes and skills that a graduate applies in different contexts can be referred to
                               as capabilities (Hager, 2006).  Consistent  with  the interchangeable terms used
                                                                                               V01-2018-05-30]]></page><page Index="51"><![CDATA[9

                               to  describe generic  skills  and  attributes, different  labels  are also used in  the
                               literature  to    describe    the    notion    of  work    readiness  including    “work
                               preparedness”,    “graduate    employability”,    “transferable    skills”    and    “generic
                               attributes”.
                                      The findings by Carless (2007) in particular, provide some useful insight
                               into the practices of Australian   organizations.    The   most   common   methods
                               used   by   the   50   Australian organizations  surveyed,  in  order  of  popularity
                               were,  application  forms,  interviews,  cognitive ability  tests,  personality  tests
                               and    assessment  centers.    These  selection  methods    are    each  designed    to
                               predict    different    dimensions    of    performance    criteria,    however,    not    all
                               methods  are  employed  in  the  same  selection  process.    According  to  Carless,
                               while  more  than  half  of  the  Australian      organizations      utilized      a      selection
                               battery   comprising three   methods: application forms, interviews and one other
                               selection method of choice, 42% indicated they only used application forms and
                               interviews to select graduate applicants. Although  these methods  have  been
                               shown  to  demonstrate  validity  across  occupational  groups  and  in various
                               contexts,  it  is  less  clear  how  effective  they  are  in  assessing  potential  in
                               graduate applicants.  In particular the fact that some organizations only rely on the
                               use of application forms  and  interviews  raises  concerns  about  the  ability  of
                               current  assessment  methods  in being able to examine graduate work readiness
                               as a construct in itself.
                                      Mintz (2019) enumerated concerns about career readiness of graduates. It
                               is  said  that  college  education  is  “excessively  theoretical  and  disconnected  from
                               [the]  real  world”.  Also,  students  are  said  to  be  lack  of  necessary  skills  and
                               experience  that  the  employers  are  looking  for  and  lack  of  “realistic  career
                               aspirations” or plan to fulfill their goals. In a 2017 survey conducted by Gallup and
                               Strada  (as  cited  by  Mintz,  2019),  only  a  third  of  32,000  college  students  they
                               asked  are  confident  that  they  will  graduate  with  the  necessary  skills  and
                               knowledge that the employers are seeking and only half of them think that they
                               will  have  a  good  job  with  their  major.  In  addition,  less  than  half  of  the  recent
                               college  graduates  were  competent  in  oral  and  written  communication  and  only
                               56% excel in critical thinking and problem solving based on a survey conducted
                               by the National Association of Colleges and Employers (as cited by Mintz, 2019).
                               He wrote that universities can better prepare students by providing students and
                               faculties insights about employment trends, outcomes, and earnings. They should
                               also  embed  career  exploration,  align  curricula  with  workforce  outcomes,  and
                               connect students with alumni and employers.

                               Employability Skills Framework
                                             Jackson  and  Chapman’s  (2011)  framework  of  20  skills,  broadly
                               considered to represent typical industry skill requirements of business graduates.
                               Jackson  and  Chapman’s  own  framework  derived  from  an  extensive  review  of
                               employer-based studies on industry-relevant skill requirements in undergraduates.
                               To  measure  the  perception  of  graduates  on  their  preparedness,  satisfaction  of
                               employers on the employment performance of the graduates, and to characterize
                               graduates’  workplace  performance  as  perceived  by  employers,  the  proposed
                               study will adapt the skills framework from the instrument used by Jackson et. al, in
                               2013  in  their  study.  These  are;  effective;  communication  skills  self-awareness;
                               critical  thinking  skills;  data  analyzing  skills  and  use  of  technology;  problem-
                               solving; working effectively with others; initiative and enterprise development; self-
                               management ;social responsibility; professionalism.

                               Employers’ satisfaction on the work attitudes of graduates
                                          Plantilla in 2017, used ten personal qualities to measure the satisfaction of
                               employers to the attitude of the graduates, these are; 1.) Flexibility (responds well

                               to  change,  2.)  Creativity  (identifies  new  approaches  to  problem),  3.)  Empathy
                               (understands the situations, feelings, or motives of others), 4.) Reliability (can be
                               depended  on  to  complete  work  assignments),  5.)  Integrity  (understands  and
                               applies  ethical  principles  to  decisions),  6.)  Self-discipline  (exhibits  control  of
                               personal  behavior),  7.)  Work  Optimism  (positive  attitude  toward  work.),  8.)
                               Enthusiasm  (willingness  to  learn),  9.)  Compliance  (understands  and  takes
                               directions  for  work  assignments),  and 10.)  Accountability  (accepts  responsibility
                               for  consequences  of  actions).  These  will  also  be  adapted  to  measure  work
                               attitude perceived by graduates and to measure the satisfaction of employers to
                               the work performance and attitudes of the graduates.
                                         As  a  result  on  his  study,  employers  were  extremely  satisfied  with  the
                               personal qualities exhibited by the graduates in workplace. They were extremely
                               satisfied with the graduates on their willingness to learn, positive attitude towards
                               work  responsibility  and  ability  to  take  directions  and  assignments.  Employers
                               considered  all  the  stated  personal  qualities  as  extremely  important  for  the
                               employees  to  successfully  perform  their  job.  They  put  much  premium  on  self-
                               discipline,  positive  attitude  towards  work  and  willingness  to  learn  as  important
                               qualities  of  an  employee.  These  personal  qualities  should  emanate  to  the
                               graduates for them to be hired in their jobs.

                               Relevance and Responsiveness of curricular program in the Philippines
                                          Curriculum is a broad set of experiences that students go through during
                               the entire time they are in school. The curriculum is generally considered as the
                               complete  course  path  that  will  enable  students  to  attain  the  goals  and  general
                               objectives of education. It is the learner‘s engagement with various aspects of the
                               environment, which is under the direction of the school. Curriculum empowers all
                               students  and  motivates  them  towards  lifelong  learning.  But  because  of
                               technological  advancements,  the  spread  of  new  information  media  and  the
                               predominance of software and hardware devices, a school‘s curriculum should be
                               enhanced.  It  should  be  pragmatic  to  meet  the  needs  of  society  and  should
                               conform to the actualities of the community. A school‘s curriculum should be re-
                               structured  with  a  likely  shift  towards  a  more  meaningful  course  of  study.  It  is
                               indeed very important for an educational institution to have a balanced and well-
                               designed curriculum for all the programs it offers. In doing so, the institution shall
                               have a more stable system in undertaking its goals and mission so as to make its
                               curricular programs efficient and effective to its major concern – the students.
                                         Central to the realization of an institution‘s goal is continuity and innovation
                               anchored on a relevant curriculum. Change in strategies, in the course contents,
                               in  methodologies  for  teaching,  is  well  recognized  as  sensitive,  difficult  and
                               sometimes,  impossible,  so  much  so  that  the  acceptance  of  the  status  quo  is
                               pervasive.  There  is  a  great  belief  that  if  a  plan  is  well  planned  and  based  on
                               logical theories and goals; there is nothing that will prevent it from being initiated.
                               Yet, it will also be noted that a quite a number of elaborately planned innovations
                               and  curricular  changes  have  floundered  on  the  threshold  of  the  bureaucratic
                               organization (Hagos & Dejarme, 2008).

                               From  Curriculum  to  Career:  Connecting  Curriculum  Outcomes  to  Future
                               Careers
                                          Students often arrive at university level instruction with some idea of
                               their future employment direction. It is important for university instructors to
                               seize their student’s career enthusiasm and foster a connection between the
                               curriculum  and  potential  future  career  applications.  Providing  students  with
                               an  opportunity  to  connect  their  classroom  learning,  (online  or  face-to-face)
                               with workplace relevance will result in many positive learning outcomes such
                               as  motivation,  grit,  and  career  goal  setting.  As  stated  by  Schwartz,  Gregg,


                                                                                               V01-2018-05-30]]></page><page Index="53"><![CDATA[11

                               and McKee (2018) “Guidance and information focused on careers should be
                               included  throughout  one’s  undergraduate  experience”  (p.  51).  To  integrate
                               career  content  into  the  classroom  the  following  tips  are  suggested:
                               integrating  career  focused  topics  in  discussions  and  activities;  using  and
                               integrating  services  offered  by  career  resource  centers;  including  guest
                               speakers;  and  incorporating  additional  online  career  resources.  These
                               strategies help foster a connection between course material and professions
                               and careers students may be considering.
                                          Instructors have the unique opportunity to help students explore future
                               career  opportunities.  Research  has  shown  the  importance  of  providing
                               college-level students with the skills needed to explore career opportunities.
                               University  students  need  to  be  exposed  to  career  exploration  in  their  early
                               coursework,  via  classroom  discussions,  university  career  resources  and
                               online  career  sites,  and  real-world  speakers.  Career  education  is  a  lifelong
                               learning  experience  that  needs  to  have  a  greater  focus,  from  the  first
                               semester through the last, for all university students (Levin & Mudd, 2018).


                               Mobile Application Development
                                           In the modern age of Information and communication system, people
                               are  habituated  to  use  computer  and  computer  application.  But  Mobile
                               Application uses and development is a new and rapidly growing sector. There
                               is  a  global  positive  impact  of  mobile  application.  Using  mobile  application
                               developed country are becoming facilitate and people, society of developing
                               country  are  upgrading  themselves  and  making  a  new  type  of  IT
                               infrastructure.  Mobile  applications are running on  a small  hand  hold mobile
                               device  which  is  moveable,  easy  to  use  and  accessible  from  anywhere  and
                               any  place.  Now  a  day,  so  many  people  are  using  mobile  application  to
                               contact friends, browse internet, file content management, document creating
                               and  handling,  entertainment  etc.  From  everywhere  user  can  get  facility  of
                               mobile application. People can do many things of his daily life and business
                               life. Not only the mobile application has an impact for user but also it plays
                               an  important  role  in  business.  Many  business  companies  are  earning
                               revenue using mobile  application.  The  mobile  application has  an  impact on
                               society.  The mobile application  run  in a mobile environment  which usability
                               depends on several factors such as: Screen resolution, Hardware limitations,
                               Expensive Data Usage, Connectivity issues, Limited Interaction possibilities.
                               Last few years the mobile companies are trying to develop mobile device with
                               more  screen  resolution,  more  storage,  better  connectivity  which  provide
                               better environment for modern mobile application (Islam & Mazumder, 2010).
                                           Usability testing is a common tool used to evaluate the usability of a
                               mobile  application  in  a  development  process.  Usability  tests  are  usually
                               conducted using a think aloud protocol based on K. A. Ericsson and H. A. Simon’s
                               work (1980, 1984). Users are given tasks in a test environment and encouraged
                               to  think  aloud  while  trying  to  accomplish  the  tasks.  This  gives  usability
                               practitioners, information they need on how the user interface matches the natural
                               human way of thinking and acting and highlights the features and processes to be
                               improved (Kaikkonen et. al.,2005).

                               C. Data Collection Procedure
                                         There  will  be  two  questionnaires  to  be  used  in  this  study.    The  first
                                  questionnaire,  The Workplace Preparedness  and Attitudes  Inventory  (please
                                  see  Appendix  1),  has  three  parts  and  will  be  answered  by  the  CvSU  TC
                                  Graduates.  The first part will determine the profile of CvSU TC graduates as
                                  to their status, nature and area of employment.  The second part is expected
                                  to determine the level  of workplace preparedness and attitudes of CvSU-TC
                                  Graduates.    This  was  adapted  from  the  Employability  Skills  Framework  by
                                  Jackson,  D.,  Sibson,  R.  &  Riebe,  L.  (2013).  The  third  part  determines  the
                                  graduates’ workplace attitudes using the ten personal qualities of employees
                                  adapted  from  the  study  of  Plantilla  in  2017.The  fourth  part  determines  their
                                  perception of relevance and responsiveness of their curricular program to their
                                  current employment.
                                         The  second  questionnaire,  The  Employer’s  Feedback  (please  see
                                  Appendix 2), is intended for the employers of the CvSU-TC Graduates.  It has
                                  three  parts.    The  first  part  contains  information  relative  to  the  employer’s
                                  profile.  The second questionnaire determines their perception and satisfaction
                                  towards  quality  of  workplace  performance  of  CvSU  TC  graduates  who  were
                                  employed in their organization which was also adapted from the Employability
                                  Skills  Framework  (Jackson,  et.al,  2013).      The  third  part  determines  their
                                  perception  of  relevance  and  responsiveness  of  the  CvSU-TC  curricular
                                  programs based on the workplace performance of the latter’s graduates.
                                         The data that will be collected from the three studies will be utilized as
                                  basis for graduate tracing mobile application development.
                                         Prior  to  the  actual  distribution  of  the  instrument,  the  developed
                                  questionnaire  will  be  pre-tested  to  selected  graduating  students  and  some
                                  organization  leaders  who  were not part of  the study  to  determine  its validity
                                  and reliability.  Once validity and reliability are established, this will be sent to
                                  the  graduates  and  their  employers.    Simultaneously,  each  graduate  will  be
                                  contacted through any communication forms available such as, but not limited
                                  to,  texts,  social  media  sites,  and  emails.    An  online  form  (or  a  mobile
                                  application)  of  these  questionnaires  will  be  prepared  to  reduce  the  cost  of


                                                                                               V01-2018-05-30]]></page><page Index="55"><![CDATA[13

                                  D.  Data Analysis
                                         The developed questionnaires will be subjected to validation by some
                                   experts in the field.  Cohen’s Kappa coefficient will be used to measure the
                                   inter-rater reliability or agreement between two or more experts to assess the
                                   validity  of  these  documents.    On  the  other  hand,  Cronbach’s  alpha  will  be
                                   used  to  determine  the  internal  consistency  of  the  constructs  used  in  the
                                   survey when answered by a group of participants.
                                         All  data  to  be  gathered  will  be  tabulated  and  analyzed  accordingly.
                                   Descriptive  statistics  such  as,  but  not  limited  to,  frequency  counts,  ranks,
                                   means, and percentages, will be used to describe the primary data that will be
                                   collected among the graduates and employers.  Likert scales will be used to
                                   describe  the  variables  in  this  study.    Furthermore,  correlation  tests  will  be
                                   used to explore relationships among the variables involved in this study.  The
                                   data will be analyzed using the Statistical Packages for Social Sciences v. 22.
                                         Weighted  means  will  be  computed  based  on  the  participants’
                                   responses and will be converted accordingly:

                       Students’  financial  needs,  company  incubation  requirements,  personal  and

               professional development necessities, and community support programs were all the


               matters  that  the  researchers  addressed  in  their  proposal  for  the  school-based

               Entrepreneurial Center.

                       The initial study on the establishment of a Higher Education Institution (HEI)


               School-Based Entrepreneurial Center was conducted using the Cost-Benefit Analysis

               (CBA) and environmental scanning using the Strengths-Weaknesses-Opportunities-


               Threats (SWOT) Analysis. Due to the fact that costs and benefits must be anticipated

               throughout time as well as change, the expenses associated with  constructing the


               Center  were  defined,  and  all  projected  benefits  were  enumerated  to  assess  the

               project’s viability.]]></page><page Index="83"><![CDATA[Credible personalities with knowledge in the operation of a higher education

                                  The study was conducted to comparatively analyze the consumers’ satisfaction
                      on e-commerce and traditional businesses in the City of Paranaque during COVID-19
                      pandemic.  Specifically, the study aimed to: (1) determine the demographic profile of
                      the respondents; (2) determine the preference of the respondents between e-commerce
                      and traditional business; (3) measure the level of satisfaction of the respondents on e-
                      commerce;  (4)  measure  the  level  of  satisfaction  of  the  respondents  on  traditional
                      business;  (5)  determine the  significant  difference  between the  respondents’  level  of
                      satisfaction  on  e-commerce  and  traditional  business;  (6)  determine  the  significant
                      difference  on  the  respondents’  level  of  satisfaction  on  e-commerce  when  grouped
                      according to profile; and (7) determine the significant difference on the respondents’
                      level  of  satisfaction  on  traditional  business  when  grouped  according  to  profile.
                      Descriptive method was used in the study. The researcher will use the self-made survey
                      questionnaire which was prepared for 384 respondents based on the 689,992 population.
                      The  researcher  used  four  (4)  statistical methods  in  order  to  answer  specifically the
                      questions in the statement of the problem. Frequency and percentage determine the
                      distribution of responses based on questionnaires. Mean computed the average of a
                      multiple data supplementary for each statement used. Paired samples t-test.

                              The  results  of  the  study  revealed  that  the  consumer  satisfaction  level  of
                       respondents towards e-commerce when grouped according to their age, civil status, and
                       employment status has no significance. When grouped according to their age, civil status
                       and employment status the same result was generated as e-commerce and traditional
                       business are both preferred.

                   (11)   Sources of Fund: CvSU Grant

                   (12)   Rationale:

                                 Gender  equality  or  rights  within  education  refers  to  the  right  of  men  and
                          women  to  non-discrimination  in  educational  opportunities.    This  suggests  that
                          educational  institutions  should  function  in  ways  that  do  not  impose  or  perpetuate
                          gender  stereotypes  that  exert  psychological  influence  and/or  promote  institutional
                          barriers to the range of possibilities that boys and girls, men and women, can enjoy in
                          relation to the education being offered.  This therefore relates to equality of treatment,
                          which in turn is reflected in equality of outcome.

                                 Increasing  attention  has  been  given  to  theimportance  of  achieving  gender
                          equality  ineducation.  To  date,  however,  most  efforts  havefocused  on  addressing
                          gender parity – an equalnumber or proportion of girls and boys accessingeducational
                          opportunities.  Although  simple  genderparity  may  be  easier  to  measure,  gender
                          equalityencompasses  a wider concept,  of which genderparity is  only  a part. Gender
                          equality movesbeyond access and requires that girls and boys alsoexperience the same
                          levels of quality andoutcomes of education.

                                 Teaching, as a female dominated profession, mirrors the common stereotypes
                          of  women  and  their  supposed  abilities.  Teaching  children  in  pre-elementary  and
                          elementary schools, for example, is traditionally seen as an “extension to motherhood”
                          and  therefore  a  “natural”  job  for  women  (equality@ei-ie.org,  2015).  Occupational
                          gender  bias  further  lies  on  the  assumption  that  women  are  willing  to  take  orders,
                          accept lower wages and are less prone to complain about working conditions (Anker,
                          2001).
                                 This  conferred  an  idea  to  further  pursue  exploration  about  issues  as  regards
                          gender and development.  Gender sensitivity arose and augmented the awareness of
                          every  individual  involved  in  school  settings.    Seminars,  trainings,  and  gender-
                          responsive programs were continuously provided.  With this, educators then must be

                          Gender Analysis

                                 Gender Analysis is the systematic gathering and examination of information on
                          gender differences and social relations in order to identify, understand and re-address
                          inequities based on gender. Reeves and Baden (2000), stated that gender analysis is a
                          valuable  descriptive  and  diagnostic  tool  for  development  planners  and  crucial  to
                          gender mainstreaming efforts. The components and methodology of gender analysis
                          are shaped by how gender issues are understood.

                          prioritized needs identified by women that arise from their common experiences as a
                          gender and some women’s interests, of a political or practical nature, related to their
                          experience  as  a  gendered  person.  Prioritized  concerns  have  been  translated  into  the
                          concept  of  gender  needs  (Moser,  1989).  This  identifies  the  way  in  which  women’s
                          gender  interests,  defined  by  women  themselves,  can  be  satisfied  in  the  planning
                          process. Although needs and interests are conceptually different (Molyneux, 1998), in
                          practice, they are closely related in the planning process. Needs, as well as interests,
                          result from a political process of contestation and interpretation and thus should not be
                          externally defined or seen as fixed.

                          Needs for Gender Analysis


                                 Practical Gender Needs (PGNs) according to Moser (1989) are the immediate
                          needs  identified  by  women  to  assist  their  survival  in  their  socially  accepted  roles,
                          within existing power structures. Policies to meet PGNs tend to focus on ensuring that
                          women  and  their  families  have  adequate  living  conditions,  such  as  health  care  and
                          food provision, access to safe water and sanitation, but also seek to ensure access to
                          income-earning  opportunities.  PGNs  do  not  directly  challenge  gender  inequalities,
                          even though these needs may be a direct result of women’s subordinate position in
                          society.  Strategic  gender  needs  (SGNs),  are  those  needs  identified  by  women  that
                          require  strategies  for  challenging  male  dominance  and  privilege.  These  needs  may
                          relate  to  inequalities  in  the  gender  division  of  labor,  in  ownership  and  control  of
                          resources, in participation in decision-making, or to experiences of domestic and other
                          sexual  violence.  These  needs  are  often  seen  as  feminist  in  nature  as  they  seek  to
                          change women’s status and position in society in relation to men. As such, they are
                          more likely to be resisted than PGNs. In reality, it is difficult to distinguish so clearly
                          between strategic and practical needs. Any policy or program may meet both sets of
                          needs.  Through  collective  organizing  around  practical  gender  needs,  women  may
                          achieve more strategic and transformatory goals. This politicization of practical gender
                          needs  is  a  favored  entry  point  for  NGOs  and  women’s  organizations.  However,
                          women  may  not  always  recognize  or  prioritize  their  strategic  gender  needs,
                          particularly if it could threaten their immediate practical needs. At any time, gender
                          interests may not be prioritized over women’s other interests which cut across these,
                          such as those of class and race, so assumptions cannot be made of women’s solidarity.

                          necessary to determinethe existing gender balance, and to assess the wayin which a
                          policy  or  programme  will  impact  womenand  men.  According  to  CIDA,  gender
                          analysis“provides  an  understanding  of  the  different  impactthat  legislation,  cultural
                          practices,  policies  andprograms  can  have  on  women  and  men”  (2007a).In  fact,  if  a
                          gender  analysis  is  not  conducted  duringthe  design  of  a  policy  or  programme,  it
                          mayinadvertently  increase  current  gender  inequalitiesor  lead  to  further  gender
                          inequalities (Status ofWomen Canada, 2007).

                          asdecision‐making  power  (UNESCO,  2005).Identifying  these  differences  can  help
                          policymakersand programme managers understand why thedifferences exist and reveal
                          entry points fordesigning policies and programmes that cansuccessfully address gender
                          disparities andchallenge deeply ingrained systemic inequalities inorder to remove or
                          reduce these obstacles togender equality.

                                 Girls’ education is an “important entry point tobegin tackling gender inequality
                          in  developingcountries”  (CIDA,  2003,  p.5).  Gender  equalitycannot  be  achieved  in
                          schools without a focus onfull and equal access to a good quality educationfor both
                          boys  and  girls  (UNESCO,  2000).  Whilemuch  progress  has  been  made  towards
                          increasingfemale  enrolment  in  schooling,  many  girls  still  facecultural,  societal  and
                          physical  barriers  to  attendingschool.  Increasing  girls’  access  to  education,however,
                          does  not  necessarily  lead  to  thepromotion  of  gender  equality.  Longwe  notes
                          thatschools  are  institutions  founded  on  a  dominantmale  culture  and  they  can
                          advertently  orinadvertently  perpetuate  societal  genderinequalities  through  power
                          relations withinschools, pedagogy and portrayal of male andfemale roles in textbook
                          and learning materials(1998).

                                 Gender  analysis  can  be  integral  to  understandingthe  gender  inequalities  that
                          currently exist andpossible routes to removing and reducing them. Itcan bring to light
                          areas  where  improvements  mustbe  made,  allowing  practitioners  and  researchers
                          todevelop plans and policies to meet the needs oftheir unique context. This process can
                          be aidedand scaffolded through the use of various frameworks.

                          Gender Analysis Frameworks: A Comparative Overview
                                 Gender analysis frameworks enable policymakersand practitioners to structure
                          the  application  ofresearch  on  gender  and  conceptual  theory  intogender‐sensitive
                          planning, design, implementation and monitoring and evaluation of developmentand
                          education interventions. The frameworks aredesigned to ensure that gender needs and
                          rolescan  be  identified,  addressed  and  monitored(Leach,  2003).  Although  the  most
                          commonly  usedgender  analysis  frameworks  were  designed  toaddress  issues  in  the
                          development  sector  morebroadly,  many  have  been  modified  recently  tomeet  the
                          unique needs of the education field.  Ineducation, they have been particularly useful
                          toidentify  issues  of  gender  bias  and  discrimination,and  to  assess  inequities  at  the
                          classroom, schooland national levels.

                                 This section provides an overview of the five keyframeworks that have been
                          adapted  for  genderanalysis  in  education:  the  Harvard  AnalyticalFramework,  Moser
                          Framework,  Gender  AnalysisMatrix,  Women’s  Empowerment  Framework,  andthe
                          Social  Relations  Approach.  Each  of  theseframeworks  and  elements  of  many  of
                          theseframeworks  have  been  altered,  combined  andimplemented  for  a  variety  of
                          purposes  bypractitioners  and  policymakers  in  the  field  ofeducation.  The  following
                          description brieflyhighlights some of the conceptual theories and theopportunities and
                          challenges for implementationof gender analysis.

                          important for usersto keep in mind that each framework haslimitations and must be
                          tailored to meet thecircumstances of a particular context. Most of thetools associated
                          with the gender analysisframeworks can be adapted to a variety of levelsand stages.
                          Yet, each is based on a certainapproach and set of values that need to beacknowledged
                          by the user (Leach, 2003). Inaddition, gender analysis frameworks are not apanacea to
                          the  issues  of  gender  inequality  indevelopment  or  education.  They  enable  the  userto
                          better examine gender disparity, but withoutnecessarily revealing all of the underlying
                          causes orconsequences related to men, women, boys andgirls. Rather than serving as
                          an  end,  theframeworks  are  simply  a  “starting  point  forcollective  analysis  and
                          discussion  and  for  theidentification  of  strategies  and  action  plans”(Leach,  p.  3).  As
                          there  is  a  risk  of  over‐generalizingfindings,  it  is  imperative  that  the  frameworks
                          beintegrated into a comprehensive gender strategy.

                          Gender analysis frameworks
                                 Harvard Analytical Framework.  The Harvard Analytical Framework is based
                          on aneconomic argument for the analysis of access andcontrol of resources. Developed
                          at the HarvardInstitute for International Development in 1985,the framework serves as
                          a starting point in thedesign, implementation, or monitoring andevaluation process to
                          reveal  implications  forwomen,  men,  girls  and  boys.  The  framework  hasbeen
                          commonly  used  in  schools  to  reveal  formaland  informal  discrimination  and
                          stereotyping. Itcan lead to raised awareness, discussion of thecauses and consequences
                          of discrimination and,possibly, changes in policy and practice.

                                 One of the limitations of the Harvard AnalyticalFramework is that it is “not
                          aimed at gendertransformation but at an equitable share ofresources,  which in itself
                          may not  help  women,”and may even be detrimental to  their position(Leach, p. 54).
                          The framework does not focus onthe underlying causes of gender inequity, butrather
                          argues for the inclusion of women as amechanism for efficiency. Unlike some of the
                          laterframeworks,  it  does  not  examine  the  relationshipsbetween  those  of  different
                          genders,  nor  does  itconnect  interventions  with  strategic  gender  goals.While  easy  to
                          use, the tools can be overlysimplistic, which “distort the reality and underestimatethe
                          complexity of most situations”(Leach, p. 54). The challenges of implementationalso
                          include  facilitating  constructive  discussionsabout  findings,  designing  strategic  plans
                          based ondata collected, and generating sex‐disaggregateddata when unavailable.

                                 Women’s  Empowerment  Framework.  The  Women’s  Empowerment
                          Framework,developed by Longwe in the late 1990s, is designedto assess commitment
                          to  women’s  empowerment,the  existence  of  empowerment  in  the  contextbeing
                          analysed,  and  the  impact  of  empowermenton  community  members.  In  this
                          context,empowerment  relates  to  women’s  participationand  control  of  processes  and
                          benefits. Theframework is based on the notion of four levels ofequality. In descending
                          order  of  equality  controlthey  are:  participation,  conscientisation,  accessand  welfare
                          (Leach, 2003). This frameworkadvances on the categories determined in theHarvard
                          framework  by  creating  a  hierarchy  formeasurement.  It  should  be  noted  that  lower


                                                                                                             9]]></page><page Index="94"><![CDATA[levelsdo  not  need  to  be  achieved  for  higher  levels  ofequality,  but  users  should
                          maintain realisticexpectations when designing interventions.

                                 One of the limitations of this framework is that itprovides a static picture of the
                          situation  ratherthan  measuring  change  over  time.  Like  the  HarvardAnalytical
                          Framework,  it  lacks  complexity  and  failsto  address  gender  relations.  Furthermore,
                          thehierarchy of equality provided in the frameworktool does not necessarily provide a
                          realistic view ofthe context.

                                 Moser  Framework.  The  Moser  Framework,  developed  by  CarolineMoser  at
                          the  Development  Planning  Unit  of  theUniversity  of  London,  is  often  used  in
                          conjunctionwith  the  Harvard  Analytical  Framework  to  betterunderstand  the  way  in
                          which productive,reproductive and community work can impact thegender division of
                          labour. It specifically focuses on“integrating gender in all types of intervention, andto
                          confront  power  relations  in  organizations,communities,  and  social  institutions”
                          (Moser,1999, p. 55). The framework assumes a morenuanced view of gender planning
                          by arguing that itis political as well as technical, and that conflictsexist in the planning
                          process.  The  approachintroduces  the  idea  of  the  triple  role  of  women  inproductive,
                          reproductive  and  community  work  andaims  to  examine  the  implications  that  these
                          roleshave  on  women’s  participation  in  the  developmentprocess.  Moser  makes  a
                          distinction betweenpractical needs or the needs that women or girlswould themselves
                          identify based on their existingposition in society – for example, health services –and
                          strategic  needs  or  needs  that  challenge  theirsubordinate  position  in  society,  such  as
                          legalrepresentation. These categories have beenapplied in education to recognize and
                          identify theneeds of girls regarding their access to and theprocess of schooling.

                                 This  framework  has  been  criticized  for  itsterminology  and  design.  For
                          example, the term‘role’, used to describe the various work ofwomen, is said to ignore
                          the  unequal  powerdisparity  between  genders.  Like  many  of  the  otherframeworks,  it
                          does  not  allow  users  to  understandthe  often‐intersecting  forms  of  inequality,  such
                          asclass, disability or race (Moser, 1999). In addition,divisions between strategic and
                          practical  needs  aresaid  to  create  an  unrealistic  dichotomy  that  doesnot  suit  the
                          complicated needs of girls and womenin society.

                                 Social  Relations  Approach.    The  Social  Relations  Approach,  developed  by
                          NailaKabeer in the 1990s, is unique in that it focuses onsocial relations between men,
                          women, boys andgirls, and their relationship to resources andactivities. The framework
                          uses  a  social‐justice  lensto  examine  the  aspects  of  social  relations  sharedby
                          institutions: rules, resources, people, activitiesand power. In many contexts, the Social
                          Relationsframework can replace the Harvard framework,which will allow the user to
                          move beyond merelythe identification of activities and access/control tohighlight other
                          forms  of  marginalization  –  such  asclass,  ethnicity  and  race  –  that  can  exist
                          inconjunction with gender.

                                 In the education sector, the framework can beused to analyse education as a
                          stand‐alone,  staterunservice,  as  well  as  its  relation  to  other  stateservices.  An

                          SocialRelations Approach looks at inequality at a rangeof levels, it can be one of the
                          more  complicatedframeworks  to  implement,  and  is  less  suited  for  aparticipatory
                          methodology.  It  requires  users  topossess  a  detailed  understanding  of
                          theinterdependence  of  institutions  and  the  ways  inwhich  they  perpetuate  gender
                          inequality.

                                 Gender  Analysis  Matrix.    One  of  the  unique  features  of  the  Gender
                          AnalysisMatrix is that it measures impact over time. Ratherthan looking at the current
                          situation  of  genderequality,  the  framework  asks  communities  toconsider  their
                          expectations   for   an    intervention.   It   isspecifically   designed   so   that
                          developmentpractitioners serve as facilitators, and communitymembers are believed to
                          have the knowledge andexpertise necessary to carry out the analysis. Thematrix was
                          designed  by  Rani  Parker  in  1993  andfeatures  four  levels  of  analysis:  women,
                          men,household  and  community.  There  are  also  fourcategories  of  analysis:  labour,
                          time,  resources  andculture.  Rather  than  emphasizing  overarchinggeneralities  or
                          simplifying the causes of genderinequality, the matrix creates a space for dialogueon
                          the issues of gender at the community level.

                                 As the matrix is implemented on a reoccurringbasis, the facilitated discussions
                          give rise tounexpected outcomes, issues or changes withinthe community. Because the
                          focus  of  thisframework  is  to  mobilize  community  members  toassess  their  needs,  a
                          well‐trained  facilitator  isparticularly  critical  for  effective  implementation,which  can
                          serve  as  a  challenge.  In  addition,addressing  the  unexpected  issues  that  arise  is
                          notalways  feasible,  particularly  in  resource-constrainedenvironments.  Finally,  the
                          frameworkunrealistically  assumes  that  community  membersare  agreeable  to  one
                          another and are able to workin a cooperative manner.

                                 Comparing the frameworks.  As discussed earlier, the dominant approaches
                          togender  analysis  have  been  the  WID  and  GADdiscourses,  which  emphasize
                          efficiency  andempowerment,  respectively.  The  HarvardAnalytical  Framework  and
                          Gender Analysis Matrixsubscribe to the efficiency approach to genderequality. On the
                          other  hand,  the  Women’sEmpowerment  Framework  and  Social  RelationsApproach

                          on gender varies. TheHarvard Analytical Framework, Moser Frameworkand Women’s

                                 The frameworks were also designed to addressdifferent levels of interventions.

                          Gender Roles

                                 Reproductive.   As defined by Moser, this involves the care and maintenance
                          of the household and its members, including bearing and caring for children, preparing
                          food,  collecting  water  and  fuel,  shopping,  housekeeping,  and  family  health-care.  In
                          poor communities, reproductive work is, for the most part, labor-intensive and time-
                          consuming. It is almost always the responsibility of women and girls.

                                 Filipino women, especially in rural areas, are traditionally bound to take care
                          of  homes,  and  family  –  and  also  assist  in  productive  work  in  farms,  swiddens  and
                          home gardens. Meanwhile, in self-subsistence indigenous areas, the women pound rice
                          each day. The lack of technologies to aid in easing daily household chores, including
                          rice pounding, effectively forces women to undertake strenuous activities even during
                          their childbearing years. This greatly limits the engagement of women in productive
                          employment, community activities and political affairs, and this is reinforced by the
                          social norms that give prominence to men in these spheres.

                                 Productive.  This  involves  the  production  of  goods  and  services  for
                          consumption and trade (in employment and self-employment). Both women and men
                          can be involved in productive activities, but their functions and responsibilities often
                          differ.  Women's  productive  work  is  often  less  visible  and  less  valued  than  men's
                          (March, et al. 2005).

                                 Community.  These  activities  include  the  collective  organization  of  social
                          events  and  services  -  ceremonies  and  celebrations,  activities  to  improve  the
                          community, participation in groups and organizations, local political activities, and so
                          on.  This  type  of  work  is  seldom  considered  in  economic  analyses,  yet  it  involves
                          considerable volunteer time and is important for the spiritual and cultural development
                          of  communities.  It  is  also  a  vehicle  for  community  organization  and  self-
                          determination.  Both  women  and  men  engage  in  community  activities,  although  a
                          gender division of labor also prevails here (March, et al. 2005).

                                 Moser divides community work into two different types of work. Community-
                          managing  activities  are  undertaken  primarily  by  women  as  an  extension  of  their
                          reproductive  role.  Such  activities  ensure  the  provision  and  maintenance  of  scarce

                          voluntary unpaid work, carried out during women's 'free' time. Community politics are
                          undertaken primarily by men, who take part in organized, formal politics, often within
                          the  framework  of  national  politics.  They  are  usually  paid  in  cash  for  this  work,  or
                          benefit indirectly through improved status or power (March, et al. 2005).

                                 The  study  will  use  the  Input-Process-Output-Outcome  Approach  in  order  to
                           come up with gender-based policies, strategies, interventions, recommendations, and
                           analysis in the education sector.

                                 The inputs that will be considered will be the institutional profiles, household
                           profiles,  triple  roles,  leisure  activities,  time  devoted  to  triple  roles  and  leisure
                           activities, access to and control over resources and benefits, and the problems, needs,
                           and constraints encountered.

                                 Based on these primary data, gender analysis will be conducted to create sex-
                           disaggregated data on the household profiles and access to and control over resources
                           and  benefits;  and  differentiate  gender  roles  among  secondary  educators  in  general.
                           Also, the identified problems, needs, and constraints among the participants will be
                           the  basis  for  policy  formulation,  strategies,  interventions,  and  recommendations  in
                           order  to  come  up  with  school-community  that  is  gender-responsive.

                                     The study will be conducted in public central elementary schools in each
                              town of Cavite.  Central elementary schools were pre-selected to reduce time and
                              effort in reaching the said schools as these were located in the town proper.

                          b.  Sampling Procedure
                                     Total  enumeration  of  male  participants  will  be  employed.    Systematic
                              random sampling will be employed to select the female participants which shall
                              be equivalent to the number of male participants.
                                      A total of 250 elementary teachers from 23central elementary schools in
                              the  municipalities  and  cities  of  Cavite  will  be  the  target  participants.    Table  1
                              presents the number of elementary school teachers that will be selected from each
                              school.
