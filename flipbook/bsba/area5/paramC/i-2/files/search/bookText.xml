                     Section 3.  Finance

                            1.  Sources of Funds


                                   Financial       resources       are     generated       through
                            international      and     local   grants,     donations,      bilateral
                            agreements  and  collaborations  with  government  agencies,
                            local  and  foreign  funding  institutions  and  other  research
                            agencies and councils.

                                   There  are  two  major  classifications  of  fund  sources:
                            the  internal  and  external  funds.    The  internal  funds  come
                            from  the  general  appropriation  allocation  (GAA)  of  the
                            Philippine  government.    The  Center  also  generates  funds
                            from the Income Generating Project of its various units.   On
                            the  other  hand,  the  external  funds  come  from  government
                            agencies such as DA-BAR, PCARRD, INIBAP, and STIARC as
                            well  as  foreign  agencies,  private  organizations  and  industry
                            partners.


                               2.  Handling of Research Funds

                                   All  research  funds  are  handled  by  the  Finance
                            Management  Office  in  coordination  with  the  Office  of  the
                            Director  of  Research.    Books  of  accounts  are  kept  by  the
                            Accounting Department which is also under the supervision
                            of the Director of Administrative and Support Services.


                                   Research  funds  that  are  externally  funded  are  pooled
                            and  treated  as  trust  funds.  The  Director  of  Research
                            exercises  general  control  over  all  these  research  grants.
                            These  are  deposited  in  the  bank  as  trust  fund  lumped
                            together  to  earn  interest.    Funds  are  released  to  the
                            Accounting  Office  by  project  allotments.    The  project/study
                            leaders  handle  all  the  processing  of  papers  to  release  the
                            fund meant for their research projects/studies.  Fund from
                            income  generating  projects  are  also  being  handle  by  the
                            Accounting  Division  with  full  control  of  the  Research
                            Director.

                            3.  Control of Research Fund

                                   Research funds will be reported in terms of obligation
                            or  liquidation.    The  Accounting  Department  controls
                            expenditures in accordance with the items in the budget and
                            sub-allotment.  Payrolls, vouchers, request for supplies and

                                                                                                 250]]></page><page Index="11"><![CDATA[CvSU MANUAL OF OPERATIONS

                             Director  of  Support  Services/President  depending  upon  the
                             amount.

                             Accounting  Department  of  the  Office  of  the  Administrative

                             rules and regulations.

                             the implementation of research and development program in
                             SUCs  will  be  subjected  to  pre-auditing  and  post  auditing
                             procedure prescribed by the Commission on Audit (COA).The
                             internal audit which is under the supervision of the Director

                    Article 4. System of Making Research and Development Plans

                                 The R and E planning process may involve the following:


                               Assessment of environment.  Program planning which is
                        done by R and E management in coordination with the RECETS
                        starts with the analysis of the factors in the environment relevant
                        to the R and E programs. Environment factors refer to the set of
                        forces  both  inside  and  outside  the  organization  that  affects
                        organization’s  performance  (Certo,  1994).    The  internal
                        environmental  factors  that  can  be  considered  are  institutional
                        capacity, structure, support system (financial and administrative)
                        and organizational management.

                               Major consideration of the external factors can be focused
                        on the political and national policies, laws and procedures of the
                        government  as  well  as  the  development  programs  of  National
                        Development  Authority  (NEDA),  Department  of  Agriculture  (DA),
                        Department  of  Science  and  Technology  (DOST),  Department  of
                        Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) and Commission on
                        Higher Education (CHED).

                               Setting  of  priorities.  In  setting  the  R  and  E  priorities  and
                        agenda the institution should consider its national and regional
                        thrusts  and  mandates.    It  should  also  consider  the  information
                        and feedback from various agencies and source such as:

                                      National Agencies.  The national priorities set by the
                                      various agencies  are usually referred to and serve as
                                      basis for setting R and E priorities and agenda of an
                                                                                                  251]]></page><page Index="12"><![CDATA[CvSU MANUAL OF OPERATIONS

                            starts  when  the  Director  of  Research  calls  for  an  annual
                            research  proposal  review.    Interested  faculty  researchers
                            create capsule proposals in line with the University’s current
                            research  thrust/s  and  other  fields  of  interest.    Faculty
                            researchers  having  the  same  field  of  interest  may  form  a
                            research program consisting of various projects and studies.
                            Otherwise,  a  researcher  may  prepare  his/her  own
                            project/study  proposal  in  accordance  with  the  University’s
                            current thrust or with their respective fields of interest.  The
                            proponent  submits  the  capsule  research  proposal  thru
                            proper  endorsement  to  the  Research  Director.    Appendix  1
                            shows the sample of standard research proposal format used
                            by all researchers for external funding.  See Figure 2- page

                                                                                                    253
                          Council  is  chaired  by  the  Vice  President  for  Research  and
                          Extension and co-chaired by the Director for Research.


                                  Once  the  proposals  are  presented,  the  committee
                          reviews  the  title,  rationale,  objectives,  expected  output,
                          methodology,  and  budget  of  the  research  proposals.    The
                          evaluators must provide relevant comments and suggestions
                          on  how  to  further  improve  the  contents  of  the  proposals.
                          Appendix  2  shows  the  Research  Proposal  Evaluation  Sheet
                          Form 1.


                                  The criteria for the evaluation of the research proposal
                          shall be based on the following:


                                       clarity of the rationale
                                       rationality and attainability of set objectives
                                       appropriateness of the methodology
                                       feasibility in terms of time

                                         proponents
                                       potential impact of the expected research results
                                       budget proposed for the research


                          Once  the  capsule  proposal  is  approved  by  the  URDE,  the
                   researcher shall prepare a detailed proposal.  On the other hand,
                   disapproved proposals will have to be revised and be subjected to
                   another review.

                   Section 3.  Budget Allocation


                                  For institutionalized researches, the Research Director

                    Section 5.  Technology Development Process

                                   In  accordance  to  DOST-PCARRD,  the  technology
                            development  process  is  composed  of  five  major  phases:
                            technology         generation,         verification,       adaptation,
                            dissemination  and  commercialization  (PCARRD  Highlights
                            2001, 1997 and 1995).


                                   Technology Generation (TG) This is the scientific and
                            experimental stage wherein a R and D center utilizes all its
                            resources human/technical, financial, material, physical and
                            other  resources  to  generate  a  component  technology  or  a
                            package  of  technology.  The  technology  generated  shall  vary
                            in  accordance  to  the  mandates  of  each  of  the  R  and  D
                            Center.


                                     Technology  Verification  (TV)  A  technology  is
                            classified  for  verification  if  it  can  be  incorporated  in  a
                            package  of  technology  that  has  potential  for  improving
                            existing farmers’ practices. Specifically, it should satisfy the
                            following:

                                  It is an integrated technology conducted in the farmers’
                                   fields
                                  It has been tested for two seasons in TG trials
                                  It has shown economic and technical feasibility in TG
                                   trials.  Its computed return based on TG trial is better
                                   than that of farmers’ practices as shown by marginal
                                   rate of return (MRR)
                                  It  is  perceived  to  be  socially  acceptable  and
                                   environmentally safe.


                                    Technology Adaptation (TA) A technology is classified
                            as technology for adaptation if it meets the following criteria:

                                  It is conducted in the station or the farmers’ field and
                                   is only a component of technology
                                  It  has  been  tested  for  TG  research  for  at  least  one
                                   season
                                  It has shown good potential for economic feasibility as
                                   based on TG research
                                  It  has  good  potential  for  acceptance  by  intended  end
                                   users



                                                                                                 254]]></page><page Index="15"><![CDATA[CvSU MANUAL OF OPERATIONS

                                      Technology  Dissemination  (TD)  This  is  the  stage
                             when  promoters  of  technologies  can  use  varied  approaches
                             and  methods  in  bringing  technologies  to  end  users.
                             Technologies  are  ready  for  dissemination  if  these  have  met
                             the following criteria (PCARRD Highlights 2001):

                                   General adaptability – these are replicable under field
                                    conditions
                                   Economic profitability – their percent of profitability is
                                    equal  to  the  prevailing  rate  of  interest  on  loans  of
                                    formal  financial  institutions.    Profitability  also
                                    considers social costs and benefits
                                   Social  acceptability  –  these  do  not  contradict  social
                                    norms and values prevailing in the community; and
                                   Potential  availability  of  support  services  –  users  have
                                    access to market, credit facilities, material inputs and
                                    others.

                                    Information  for  Dissemination  (ID)  The  Center  may
                             develop  not  only      technology  but  also  information  that  is
                             useful in the agricultural and rural development. Information
                             to be disseminated shall possess the following criteria:

                                   Possess  significant  social  and  economic  implications
                                    associated with technology adoption
                                   Contribute  to  a  better  understanding  of  research
                                    problems
                                   Offer  information  gaps  in  basic  knowledge  of
                                    agriculture, forestry and natural resources
                                   Help  policy  makers  formulate  policies  in  food,
                                    agriculture and natural resources.

                                  The Technology Assessment Protocol (TAP)

                                    Technology  assessment  is  an  important  aspect  of  the
                             whole  technology  development  process.    It  requires  the
                             process  of  anticipation  and  analysis  of  a  broad  range  of
                             socio-cultural,  technical,  economic,  environmental  and
                             political/legal  impact  prior  to  the  introduction  of  a  given
                             technology  or  even  while  a  specific  technology  is  being
                             promoted.    The  success  of  the  technology  assessment
                             depends on the efficient gathering and synthesis of adequate
                             information.  The TAP, which was developed by PCARRD in
                             2000,  embodies  some  recent  innovations  in  technology
                             assessment  procedures  and  processes.    The  processes  are
                             facilitated by the use of a gap identification tool called Quick
                             Resources Appraisal (QRA), and an intervention identification
                             tool - the Risk Management Process (RMP).  The TAP aims to
                             increase the level of confidence of the R & D community on
                             the technologies it will promote and transfer.

                                    A  pre-requisite  to  the  application  of  TAP  is  the
                             organization  of  an  interdisciplinary  team  composed  of  at

                      Working Principles of Technology Assessment

                               Participatory approach
                               Team delivery
                               No role playing
                               Consensus decision making
                               Iterative and time bound
                               Procedures in Technology Assessment
                               Technology         Identification/Pre-Screening          (Technical
                                Feasibility Test)
                               Technology Classification

                               Technical Feasibility Test
                               Technology  scanning  to  determine  if  the  technology  has
                                the following attributes:
                               Socially acceptable

                       Research Policies and Procedures


                       1.  All  university  researches  (student  and  faculty)  have  to  be
                           coordinated with the Research Center.
                       2.  There  should  be  an  approved  proposal  before  a  research
                           program/project/study can be conducted,
                       3.  Student  researches  can  be  hooked  up  with  the  approved
                           research  program/project/study  of  a  faculty  member/research
                           leader.
                       4.  The  researcher  shall  prepare  progress  reports  for  on-going
                           researches and terminal report for completed ones and present
                           them during the in-house review. Failure to do so would prompt
                           the        Research      Director     to     evaluate     the     research
                           program/project/study          and      evaluate      continuation       or
                           termination of the research, as the case may be.
                       5.  The  RDE  Council,  which  has  to  be  organized/constituted  and
                           with  all  the  members  getting  functionally  involved,  shall  serve
                           as  a  clearing  house  of  all  major  activities  of  the  Research
                           Center.
                       6.  Techno  guides  have  to  be  appropriately  generated  through
                           research.
                       7.  The  University  Techno  guides  have  to  be  prepared  and
                           published.
                       8.  The research leaders have to supervise and manage the funds
                           allocated for their approved research proposal.
                       9.  The procurement of supplies, materials and equipment shall be
                           coordinated with the Property Custodian and Supply Officer of
                           the center.
                       10.    Full  time  faculty  researchers  should  hold  office  in  the
                           Research  Center.  In  cases,  where  the  faculty  researchers  have
                           teaching  load,  they  may  stay  in  their  mother  units,  provided
                           that their activities as researchers are duly coordinated with the
                           research monitoring and evaluation unit.

                           semester

                 III.   Mechanics of Implementation


                     1.  The  workload  system  applies  to  all  faculty  members  who  are
                        involved in R & E activities either full-time or part-time.

                     2. For purposes of workload credit, the assigned task external to the
                        university  shall  be  covered  by  a  Memorandum  of  Agreement
                        between the University and the partner Agency or a Special Order
                        from the office of the University President.


                     3.  A faculty member shall have a minimum of 18 credit units in R &
                        E to be classified full-time researcher/extensions.
                                                                                                    263]]></page><page Index="24"><![CDATA[CvSU MANUAL OF OPERATIONS
                  _____________________________________________________________________

                                                                                                          264
                      4.  A full-time faculty member shall be entitled to workload credit in R
                         & E only if he/she has satisfied the minimum workload of 18 credit
                         units in teaching and R & E work.

                      5.  A program leader who is a project leader and a study leader in the
                         same program shall only be credited once whichever has the higher
                         credit units.

                      6. Overload pay shall be given to faculty researchers whose total credit
                         units is beyond 25 units


                      7.  Faculty  member  with  external  activity  to  R&E  and  has  received
                         honorarium for such activity shall not be given credit units


                      8.  All claims for credit units shall be supported by proper documents.

                      9. Credit units as researcher/extensions shall only be claimed for the
                         period specified in the program/project study activity as approved.


                      10.  Workload  accreditation  of  other  R&E  activities  not  covered  by
                           these  guidelines  shall  be  referred  to  the  Office  of  the  Vice
                           President  for  Research  &  Extension  for  consideration  upon  the
                           approval of the President.

                      11. The rate of overload pay or honorarium is similar to those on full
                           time    teaching.


                      12. The funds for the overload shall come from the R & E allocation or
                           from other sources which the University deems appropriate.

                         Honorarium

                                 Honorarium is a form of remuneration granted to researchers
                         for services rendered beyond the minimum/regular workload.  It is
                         a  form  of  incentive  granted  for  the  services  of  officials/employees
                         on special assignment.   For this purpose, a special assignment is
                         an  undertaking  by  an  individual  or  a  composite  group  of
                         officials/employees,  which  is  beyond  their  regular  and  primary
                         functions.

                       Monitoring and evaluation

                       Research Projects


                              The  research  projects  are  monitored  in  two  ways:  (1)  the
                       financial and (2) the technical aspects.

                              The  accounting  department  of  the  University  monitors  and
                       audits  the  financial  status  of  the  research  funds.  However,  the
                       Special  Budget  Officer  of  the  Research  Center  records  every
                       disbursement  for  each  research  project/unit  and  annotates  the
                       Purchase Request Forms to indicate availability of funds and from
                       which funds the purchases are to be credited.

                              The  Office  of  the  Director  of  Research  serves  as  the
                       monitoring  and  coordinating  arm  for  all  researches  in  the
                       University.    Although  research  activities  are  independently
                       undertaken  by  the  different  colleges,  faculty  researchers  are  still
                       required  to  submit  quarterly  progress  reports  on  their  research
                       projects/studies.  The researchers submit their progress reports to
                       their  respective  Deans  concerned,  which  in  turn  endorses  the
                       progress  reports  to  the  Office  of  the  Director.  This  enables  the
                                                                                                   265]]></page><page Index="26"><![CDATA[CvSU MANUAL OF OPERATIONS

                       Research  Center  to  keep  track  of  ongoing  projects  for  monitoring
                       and evaluation as well as workload compensation purposes.

                           The technical reports are submitted by the project proponent to
                       the Monitoring and Evaluation Unit of the Research Center.   The
                       numbers of copies are stated below:


                             Copies  of  Progress  Report  to  be  forwarded  to  the  funding
                              agency
                             Copies of the Annual Report to be used in annual agency in-
                              house review
                             Copies  of  the  Terminal  Report  to  be  submitted  two  months
                              after the termination or completion of the project.

                       Annual Local Agency In-House Review


                              One major activity to facilitate the monitoring and evaluation
                       purposes  is  the  holding  of  the  Annual  Local  Agency  In-house
                       Review.  It involves the evaluation of all researches that are either
                       completed  or  ongoing  during  the  particular  year  under  review.
                       During these reviews, researchers present the progress/highlights
                       of  their  researches.    The  panel  of  reviewers  consists  of  members
                       from  STARRDEC,  SUC’s  and  PCARRD.    The  guidelines  for  the
                       conduct of Annual Local Agency In-House Review of the Research
                       Center are based from the implementing guidelines set by PCARRD
                       for all SUC’s conducting the review.

                       The  major  criteria  that  shall  be  used  in  evaluation  the  ongoing
                              projects are:

                                Attainment of the objectives.
                                Adherence to the approved methodology.
                                Adherence to the approved budget.
                                Accomplishments,          including     status     of    technology
                                  generated/verified.
                                Actions taken in response to previous year’s comments.
