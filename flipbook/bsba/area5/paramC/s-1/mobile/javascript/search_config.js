System of Making Research and Development Plans                                        The R and E planning process may involve the following:                                      Assessment of environment.  Program planning which is                             done by R and E management in coordination with the RECETS                             starts with the analysis of the factors in the environment relevant                             to the R and E programs. Environment factors refer to the set of                             forces  both  inside  and  outside  the  organization  that  affects                             organization’s  performance  (Certo,  1994).    The  internal                             environmental  factors  that  can  be  considered  are  institutional                             capacity, structure, support system (financial and administrative)                             and organizational management.                                     Major consideration of the external factors can be focused                             on the political and national policies, laws and procedures of the                             government  as  well  as  the  development  programs  of  National                             Development  Authority  (NEDA),  Department  of  Agriculture  (DA),                             Department  of  Science  and  Technology  (DOST),  Department  of                             Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) and Commission on                             Higher Education (CHED).                                     Setting  of  priorities.  In  setting  the  R  and  E  priorities  and                             agenda the institution should consider its national and regional                             thrusts  and  mandates.    It  should  also  consider  the  information                             and feedback from various agencies and source such as:                                             National Agencies.  The national priorities set by the                                           various agencies  are usually referred to and serve as                                           basis for setting R and E priorities and agenda of an                                                                                                       251","CvSU MANUAL OF OPERATIONS                    _____________________________________________________________________                                                                                                             252                                           institution  of  higher  learning.

Regional priorities in agriculture                                           and natural resources of the various agencies in the                                           region are also important bases in setting priorities in                                           R and E.                                           Local Government Units.  Aside from the above, the                                           institution should be sensitive to the priorities set by                                           various  local  government  units  in  the  province  and                                           the region, in particular, and the nation in general.                                           Other    Funding  Agencies.        The  institution  should                                           also  maintain  close  collaboration  with  various                                           national      and     international     funding      agencies.

Technologies are selected based on the following criteria:                                         Provide      the      means      for  improving  income      and                                          productivity of a greater majority of people;                                        Provide      immediate      solutions      to   self-sufficiency                                          problems,      environmental        sustainability,      import                                          substitution,  export  generation  and  promotion  of                                          alternative sources of food.                                                                                                             255","CvSU MANUAL OF OPERATIONS                    _____________________________________________________________________                                                                                                             256                                        The Technology Assessment Protocol (TAP)                                           Technology  assessment  is  an  important  aspect  of  the                                  whole  technology  development  process.    It  requires  the                                  process  of  anticipation  and  analysis  of  a  broad  range  of                                  socio-cultural,  technical,  economic,  environmental  and                                  political/legal  impact  prior  to  the  introduction  of  a  given                                  technology  or  even  while  a  specific  technology  is  being                                  promoted.    The  success  of  the  technology  assessment                                  depends on the efficient gathering and synthesis of adequate                                  information.  The TAP, which was developed by PCARRD in                                  2000,  embodies  some  recent  innovations  in  technology                                  assessment  procedures  and  processes.    The  processes  are                                  facilitated by the use of a gap identification tool called Quick                                  Resources Appraisal (QRA), and an intervention identification                                  tool - the Risk Management Process (RMP).  The TAP aims to                                  increase the level of confidence of the R \& D community on                                  the technologies it will promote and transfer.                                           A  pre-requisite  to  the  application  of  TAP  is  the                                  organization  of  an  interdisciplinary  team  composed  of  at                                  least  five  (5)  members  with  two  basic  expertise  that  are                                  critically needed:  a technically competent expert who knows                                  the  technology  and  the  commodity  being  assessed  and  an                                  economist with capabilities in financial analysis.

Mechanics of Implementation                          1.  The  workload  system  applies  to  all  faculty  members  who  are                           involved in R \& E activities either full-time or part-time.                          2. For purposes of workload credit, the assigned task external to the                           university  shall  be  covered  by  a  Memorandum  of  Agreement                           between the University and the partner Agency or a Special Order                           from the office of the University President.                          3.  A faculty member shall have a minimum of 18 credit units in R \&                           E to be classified full-time researcher/extensions.                                                                                                        263","CvSU MANUAL OF OPERATIONS                    _____________________________________________________________________                                                                                                             264                        4.  A full-time faculty member shall be entitled to workload credit in R                           \& E only if he/she has satisfied the minimum workload of 18 credit                           units in teaching and R \& E work.                          5.  A program leader who is a project leader and a study leader in the                           same program shall only be credited once whichever has the higher                           credit units.                         6. Overload pay shall be given to faculty researchers whose total credit                           units is beyond 25 units                         7.  Faculty  member  with  external  activity  to  R\&E  and  has  received                           honorarium for such activity shall not be given credit units                          8.  All claims for credit units shall be supported by proper documents.                         9. Credit units as researcher/extensions shall only be claimed for the                           period specified in the program/project study activity as approved.                         10.  Workload  accreditation  of  other  R\&E  activities  not  covered  by                             these  guidelines  shall  be  referred  to  the  Office  of  the  Vice                             President  for  Research  \&  Extension  for  consideration  upon  the                             approval of the President.                         11. The rate of overload pay or honorarium is similar to those on full                             time    teaching.                         12. The funds for the overload shall come from the R \& E allocation or                             from other sources which the University deems appropriate.                             Honorarium                                   Honorarium is a form of remuneration granted to researchers                           for services rendered beyond the minimum/regular workload.  It is                           a  form  of  incentive  granted  for  the  services  of  officials/employees                           on special assignment.   For this purpose, a special assignment is                           an  undertaking  by  an  individual  or  a  composite  group  of                           officials/employees,  which  is  beyond  their  regular  and  primary                           functions.                                                                                                                         264","CvSU MANUAL OF OPERATIONS                    _____________________________________________________________________                                                                                                             265                           Types of Honoraria                                   Those  paid  to  a  government  official  or  employee  or  private                           individual who is requested to speak, lecture, or act as a resource                           person in seminars, workshops, conferences,  symposia, trainings,                           or classroom sessions (AMMRO, Book I as cited by UPLB Research                           Manual, 2002)                                   Those paid to a government official or employee by another                           office in which he/she is on detail or special assignment provided                           that  if  he/she  is  already  collecting  similar  compensation  or                           allowance for the same service or period for which payment is being                           claimed he/she may only choose to collect whichever is higher but                           in  no  case  shall  he/she  receive  both  (UPLB  Research  Manual,                           2002)                                   Those  paid  to  a  government  official/employee  or  private                           individual  for  his  membership  in  or  special  assignment  to                           committees or special projects.

The  accounting  department  of  the  University  monitors  and                           audits  the  financial  status  of  the  research  funds.  However,  the                           Special  Budget  Officer  of  the  Research  Center  records  every                           disbursement  for  each  research  project/unit  and  annotates  the                           Purchase Request Forms to indicate availability of funds and from                           which funds the purchases are to be credited.
