                      h project/ unit and annotates the Purchase Request Forms to indicate
                      availability of funds and from which funds the purchases are to be
                      credited.

                             The Planning and Development Office serves as the monitoring
                      and  coordinating  arm  for  all  plans  and  projects  in  the  University.
                      Although  planning  activities  are  independently  undertaken  by  the
                      different units, each unit is required to submit  quarterly  progress
                      reports  to  PDO.  The  planning  officers  of  each  unit  submit  their
                      progress reports to their respective Deans concerned, which in turn
                      endorses  the  progress  reports  to  the  Office  of  the  Director.  This
                      enables the Planning and Development Office to keep track of ongoing
                      projects for monitoring and evaluation.

                       which stands for Train, Research, Utilize and Extend.















                                                     Dr. Bettina Joyce Ilagan, CAS


                       The body suggested to focus on strategies to address the internationalization of
                       the  University.      It  was  likewise  suggested  to  focus  on  areas  of  research  and
                       extension that are related to Arts and Sciences and to concentrate on the thematic
                       areas of the University.

                       Prof. Sedigo suggested the following:

                       a.  To connect the researches of the College to the extension to be conducted.
                       b.  Strengthen the existing offering and concentrate on improving the performance
                          in the licensure examination of the BS Psychology
                       c.  Prioritize  the  establishment  of  Centers  of  Development  or  Excellence  since
                          some of the program offerings are Level III re-accredited already.

                       Dr.  Robles  likewise  suggested  to  strengthen  instruction  and  concentrate  on
                       producing outcomes since CAS is a service college. Dr. A. Mojica on the other
                       hand, suggested on improving researches and extension works since they have
                       conducted some already.

                       Dr. Vida commented that external funding for researches are possible since the
                       College can venture into social and anthropological researches. Dr. Alava on the]]></page><page Index="46"><![CDATA[other hand, said that the College can continue the accomplishments of its previous
                       professors like the development of e-books.

                       presented CEIT’s strategic plans.  The highlights of his presentation focused on
                       the use of technology and automation to be used mainly in instruction, research
                       and extension.  Furthermore, infrastructure are mostly for the development of IT
                       facilities.




















                                                     Prof. Marlon P. Pereña, CEIT

                       Dr. Robles suggested to concentrate on the production of the best and brightest
                       students, faculty and staff rather than attracting them.

                       Dr.  Vida  said  that  CEIT  has  the  most  number  of  patentable  products  and
                       innovation. She advised CEIT focal personnel to coordinate with Dr. Teddy Tepora
                       for possible patenting of fabricated products.

                       Prof.  Sedigo  advised  to  focus  on  specific  research  and  to  collaborate  all  its
                       research  undertakings.    Dr.  Sanchez,  asked  the  help  of  CEIT  personnel  and
                       students to develop a medical database for the students.

                       On  harmonization  of  programs,  Dr.  Polinga  suggested  to  harmonize  CEIT’s
                       programs and activities with the Management Information System (MIS).  Likewise,
                       Dr.  Manuel  noted  the  need  for  streamlining  of  programs  and  revisiting  of  the
                       organizational structure to reflect the BS Office Administration.]]></page><page Index="47"><![CDATA[3.  College of Education

                       the College.  Prof. Sedigo suggested to revisit the performances of the College’s
                       graduates  in  the  licensure  examinations  and  to  strategize  to  improve  their
                       performances.

                       Among the issues and suggestions raised in the discussions were:

                          •  Possible splitting of the College to make clear-cut distinction of the
                              offerings, like the Child Development Center and Science Laboratory High
                              School.
                          •  Strict implementation of the retention policies
                          •  Inclusion of the competency appraisal for the BSE and BEE students prior
                              to graduation
                          •  Strict implementation of the comprehensive examinations
                          •  Patenting of the HRM and Science High School innovations
                          •  Preparation o for the COD and COE application by reviewing the

                       The  strategic  plans  of  Naic  Campus  were  presented  by  Prof.  John  Xavier
                       Nepomuceno. During the discussion, Dr. Vida suggested to look into the possibility]]></page><page Index="48"><![CDATA[of creating a Technology Business Incubator (TBI) in the campus.  Through this,
                       technologies to be developed can easily be commercialized.

                       Prof. Sedigo advised the dean to collaborate with some agencies most especially
                       on marine technologies.  These areas may include the operationalization of coastal
                       water resources, capacity building and aggressive recruitment of graduates.





















                                             Prof. John Xavier Nepomuceno, Naic Campus


                       Dr. Robles said that Naic Campus can conduct fishery resources research since it
                       was identified as NUCAF.  As such, it can concentrate on developing the pawikan
                       sanctuary  and  can  work  on  international  linkages  such  as  JICA,  JOCB,  and
                       PEMSEA. It can also work on the establishment of Marine Biological Research
                       center.

                       Likewise, Dr. Vida, suggested to concentrate on fishery (inland fishery) and coastal
                       services management.

                       The body suggested to:

                                 •  concentrate on resource generation
                                 •  research  collaboration  in  its  areas  of  expertise  such  as  prototype
                                     and design fabrication
                                 •  strengthen the banner programs – Industrial Technology
                                 •  publish  its  research  findings  in  refereed  journals  and  own  journal
                                     once accredited


                   6.  Carmona Campus

                       Prof. Cristina M. Signo presented the strategic plans.  She said that the campus is
                       so fortunate for the active support of the LGU and some of the infrastructure will
                       soon rise.


                       The following were the suggestions raised:


                                 •  Due to decreasing enrolment, the campus can benchmark some of
                                     its programs to strengthen the offerings
                                 •  Strengthen the Academe-Industry linkage
                                 •  Review the possibility of offering some courses which can become
                                     its flagship programs
                                 •  Take the opportunity of its presence in the industrial hub of the

                                                    Dr. Analita Magsino, CAFENR

                       Recognizing  some  of  the  College’s  excellent  programs  especially  its  Level  IV
                       program, Dr.  Robles suggested to still improve its linkages in terms of the number
                       of MOAs and MOUs signed, approved and secured. Other suggestions were:

                          •  Work on collaboration  with international research and funding agencies
                          •  Study the possibility of tie-up with ASEAN universities]]></page><page Index="51"><![CDATA[•  Conduct policy researches in Agriculture

                       Prof. Sedigo suggested that the Graduate School should have separate extension
                       activities.  Dr. Nuestro said that each college has its own extension work and the
                       graduate students are involved.  Dr. Polinga said the graduate students can be
                       tapped as speakers according to their expertise.

                       Dr. Robles suggested that the Graduate School can offer courses to support the
                       Department  of  Education  through  strengthening  of  the  learning  centers  in  the
                       campuses.  Along with this is the possible membership to the International Council
                       of  Distance  Education  and  involvement  in  the  transnational  education.
                       Involvement and participation of graduate in research can likewise be enhanced
                       through the Faculty and Students Research Capability Program of the University
                       (FSRCEP).

                       Other suggestions for consideration in the Graduate School were the following:

                          •  Offering of the graduate programs during weekdays and weeknights
                          •  Training of the graduate faculty to make them technology savvy
                          •  Observance of the intellectual property rights in the innovations and
                              discoveries of the graduate students
                          •  Sponsorship of conferences of the graduate students]]></page><page Index="52"><![CDATA[9.  Office of Student Affairs and Services

                              and their parents the warmest welcome from the University.
                          •  Careful utilization of student publication fund
                          •  Conduct of the psychological assessment of the students
