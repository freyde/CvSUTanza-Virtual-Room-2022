The Planning Process                      The University employs the participatory approach in planning (Figures 1 \& 2). In the              preparation of the Revised Strategic Development Plan 2016-2020, a planning committee               was  created  to  draft  the  University  Macro  Plan,  which  includes  the  general  thrust  and              directions of the University for the development period. Upon approval by the President, the               Planning Office calls for a planning workshop to develop and synthesize micro strategies of              the different colleges /units toward the overall University master plan.                     Strategic  plans  are  prepared  by  the  different  councils  which  in  turn  are               communicated to respective colleges/units of the University. At the college/unit level, mini-              workshops  were  conducted  and  participated  in  by  the  dean,  faculty  members  and  staff,               students,  community  representatives,  alumni,  and  other  stakeholders.  The  output  is              presented  to  the  faculty  and  staff  for  further  deliberation.  The  University  Administrative               Council reviews the final draft presented during the planning workshop and the Planning              Office consolidates the outputs of different colleges/units.

The key activities for each of              the development agendum were identified by the vice presidents in consultation with their               respective deans/directors, unit heads, faculty, staff, students and other stakeholders. The              development  agenda  were  presented  during  the  2015  Strategic  Planning  Workshop  and               Regional  Benchmarking  held  last  April  28-30,  2015  in  Bulacan  and  Pampanga  and              reviewed by the members of the Administrative Council.                                                                                                              Page | 5","The Outcomes – Based Planning Process Model              Logic model is a narrative or graphical depiction of processes that presents the underlying               assumption upon which an activity (e.g. strategic planning) is expected to lead to a specific              result.  Logic  models  illustrate  a  sequence  of  cause-and-effect  relationships  –  a  systems               approach to communicate the path toward a desired result (Millar, A., R.S. Simeone, and              J.T. Carnevale, 2001).               The Outcomes-Based Planning Process Model for BS Agriculture Program is presented in              Figure 3. Like all State Universities and Colleges, CvSU is guided by a set of fundamental               statements, the Vision, Mission and Core Values, that serve as the basis for the strategic              planning. These basic statements (1) define the reason for the existence of the university,               (2) articulate the specific outcomes that the university intends to deliver, and (3) state the              guiding principles that form the basis for the university's behaviour and action. The inputs              include  those  things  that  the  university  invests  in  strategic  planning  such  as  human               resources, administrative structures, research findings, skills, expertise, etc. Describing the              inputs  needed  for  a  program  provides  an  opportunity  to  communicate  the  quality  of  the               program. Inputs that communicate to others that the program is of high quality include:                   human resources,  such as time invested  by administrators, faculty, staff, students                      and other concerned stakeholders;                   material  and  financial  resources,  including  appropriated  funds,  facilities  and                      supplies;                   approved planning and development manual for the specific guidelines and policies;                    research findings or knowledge base for the program, including curriculum, research                     Results e.g.  results of SWOT Analysis and Environmental Analysis; and                    monitoring and evaluation systems.                     The Implementation phase is divided into two parts: the Program/Activities and the                                                                                                        Page | 6","Partners. Among the programs/activities conducted to craft the strategic development plan              were:  Environmental  Analysis,  SWOT  Analysis,  Stakeholders  Consultative  meetings,               Strategic  Planning  Workshops  and  Benchmarking,  Internal  Assessment  and  Program              Quality Assurance. Included  among CvSU's partners in crafting its strategic development               plan were: students, faculty and staff, administrators, alumni, parents, employers, industry              partners,  local  government  units,  line  agencies,  Higher  Education  Institutions  (HEIs)  and               foreign partners.              ‘The  outcomes  of  the  planning  process  can  be  short-term,  intermediate-term  and  long-               term. Outcomes answer the questions \"What happened as a result of the  well-developed              planning processes in support of quality assurance?\" Outcomes are useful to communicate               the impacts of the effort, resources and time that the university invested to such planning              process.                     Short-term  results  of  the  planning  process  include:  BOR  Approved  University               Development  Plan  Approved  Revised  CAFENR  Strategic  Development  Plan  (2017-2022)              Approved  College  Operational  Plan),  BOR  Approved  3-Year  Rolling  Investment  Program               Approved  Quality  Assurance  Strategic  Plan  (Quality  Assurance  and  Accreditation  Center              Manual  of  Operation),  Approved  5  Year  Research  and  Development  Plan  Extension               Services  Strategic  Plan  2017-2022  and  BOR  Approved  Strategic  Performance              Management System,                      Medium-term  results  are  the  changes  that  follow  the  short-term  outcomes.  These              changes  lead  to  improved  conditions  such  as:  increased  program  recognition,  higher               program  accreditation  status,  increased  funding  for  development  projects,  increased              government support (e.g. research and scholarship grants for faculty and staff), improved              faculty, staff and student performance and improved satisfaction rating for various services               (e.g. improved facilities, enhanced teaching and learning activities, etc).

In 2007, four of the province's municipalities and cities namely: General Mariano Alvarez,              Cavite  City,  Bacoor  and  Dasmariñas  were  included  in  the  top  ten  most  populated               cities/municipalities outside of the National Capital Region. On the other hand, the leading              cause  of  mortality  in  the  province  in  2011  is  coronary  artery  disease,  followed  by               pneumonia, cancer, cerebro vascular accidents and hypertensive cardiovascular disease.                     In 2011, 824 industrial establishments were put up in Cavite wherein only 26% were              Filipino  owned  while  the  remaining  74%  were  established  by  the  Japanese,  Koreans,               Chinese,  Taiwanese,  Americans,  Malaysians  and  other  nationalities.  About  16%  of  the              companies  are  manufacturing  electronic,  electrical  and  telecommunication  parts  and               equipment.  Services  followed  at  15.78%  while  industries  producing  chemical,  chemical              products,  coil,  rubber  and  plastic  products  are  about  11.65%.  Only  4.73%  of  the               establishments are engaged in agri-business, livestock and poultry. Other industries in the              province include food and beverages; textile, wearing apparel and leather; wood products,               furniture  and  fixtures,  non-metallic  mineral  products;  basic  metal;  machinery;  and  toy,              games and sporting goods.                      Based on the 2011 Cavite Socio-Economic and Physical Profile (SEPP, 201 I ), a              Caviteño family earning less than 1,680.25 per month is considered poor. In 2009, 4.5% or              26,088 Caviteño families are said to be poor. This is 0.3% higher compared to 2006 but still               lower compared to 2003.

He emphasized the treatment of each unit as an important delivery and the               contribution of each one as contributors to the overall performance of the University.                     Presentation  of  the  Higher  Education  Reform  Agenda  was  one  of  the  inputs  in               reviewing  the  relevance  of  the  existing  VMGO.  The  University's  bid  to  become  a  Global              University in 2020 was seriously adopted by all units. After careful review, the executive,              administrative  and  academic  councils  unanimously  agreed  to  adopt  the  existing  VMGO,               without revision.                     The group was welcomed at the Don Honorio Ventura Technological State University               by the University Officials headed by the University President, Dr. Enrique G. Baking and              Dr. Laura Buenviaje, Executive Vice President and concurrent VP for Academic Affairs. An               audio-visual presentation of DHVTSU was shown to the group.                     There  was  an  introduction  of  the  Members  of  the  Council  of  both  CvSU  and               DHVTSU.  The CvSU members met with their respective counterparts for benchmarking.                 Monitoring, Reviewing and Updating of the Strategic Development Plan                     Strategic Development Plans are monitored in two ways: (1) the financial and (2) the              technical aspects.                      The accounting department of the University monitors and audits the financial status                                                                                                       Page | 24","of  the  plans  and  programs.  However,  the  Budget  Officer  of  the  University  records  every              disbursement for each project/unit and annotates the Purchase Request Forms to indicate               availability of funds and from which funds the purchases are to be credited.                     The  Planning  and  Development  Office  (PDO)  serves  as  the  monitoring  and               coordinating arm for all plans and projects in the University. Although planning activities are              independently  undertaken by the different  units,  each unit is required to  submit  quarterly               progress reports to PDO. The planning officers of each unit submit their progress reports to              their respective Deans concerned, which in tum endorses the progress reports to the Office               of the Director. This enables the Planning and Development Office to keep track of ongoing              projects for monitoring and evaluation.                      One major activity to facilitate the monitoring and evaluation purposes is the holding              of the Annual Planning In-house Review. It involves the evaluation of all plans and projects              that are either completed or ongoing during the particular year under review. During these               reviews, concerned heads present the progress/highlights of their strategic plans.              The major criteria that shall be used in evaluation the ongoing projects are:                    Attainment of the objectives                   Adherence to the time frame                    Adherence to the approved budget                    Accomplishments, including status of projects                   Actions taken in response to previous year's comments.

OUTCOMES              Summary of the CvSU Revised Strategic Development Plan 2016-2020                      The CvSU Revised Strategic Development Plan 2016-2020 is focused on achieving              Global University Status by 2020. As such, the strategic development plan has four phases.               Phase 1 (2016) will deal on  \"Transition from output based to outcome based quality              assurance\". In this phase, it is expected that academic programs will adopt the Outcome               Based  Education  (OBE)  where  educational  goals  are  articulated  in  terms  of  learning              outcomes, and inputs are considered tools or part of strategies to empower graduates to               become productive citizens (CMO 46 s. 2012). The focus of education shifts from what the              instructors  or  experts  give  to  the  learning  to  competencies  that  the  students               acquire/develop.  To  achieve  this,  faculty  and  staff  should  be  able  to  develop  relevant              curriculum,  instruction  and  assessment  tools  that  address  the  need  to  demonstrate  the              achievement  of  outcomes.  Likewise,  it  is  important  also  to  develop  Quality  Assurance               systems, i.e., mechanisms, procedures and processes to ensure the delivery of the desired                                                                                                       Page | 28","quality. Strong Private-Public Partnership is a must to ensure the production of graduates              with competencies that are relevant to the industry needs. Ultimately, it is expected Filipino               graduates  will  become  more  productive  and  competitive,  especially  in  the  context  of              ASEAN 2015 and the globalization of professional practice                      Other  relevant  agenda  in  this  phase  is  the  implementation  of  the  Strategic              Performance Management System (SPMS), the shift from Traditional Management System               to ISO Oriented Quality Management System.                     Phase 2 (2017) will focus on the  University’s Transformation from Re-active to               Pro-  active  strategic  planning  to  achieve  global  recognition.  At  the  forefront  of  this              phase  are:  intensive  research  development  and  innovation,  institutionalization  of  quality               instruction  delivery,  strengthening  research  based  extension  and  community  services,              reinforcement of social responsibility,   intensifying  capacity/capability   building,  upholding              merit  and  fitness  based recruitment and aggressive infrastructure development.                      The  third  phase  (2018)  will  highlight  the  University's  institutionalization  of              development programs to comply with global standards. It is expected that during this               phase,  the  University  will  achieve  QMS/ISO  Certification.  Moreover,  additional  Research              and Innovation Centers will be established enabling faculty, staff and students to produce               more patents for inventions and utility models. It is also expected that the University-wide              Information and Communication Technology (JCT) Operation will be realized. In addition,               programs  that  will  promote  health  and  wellness  of  CvSU  constituents  are  properly  and              sustainability implemented.                      The penultimate year of the plan (2019) will witness the international recognition of              the  University.  In  this  phase,  the  university  is  expected  to  exert  more  efforts  achieving              ASEAN  University  Network  (AUN)  program  recognition.  In  addition,  the  university  will               establish  stronger  partnership  with  foreign  universities,  corporations  and  organizations  to                                                                                                       Page | 29","advance instruction, research, extension and production.                     In  2019,  it  is  expected  that  more  faculty  members  will  be  able  to  publish  their               researches  in  ISI  listed  journals  and  more  authors  will  be  cited  by  SCOPUS.  Such              accomplishments  will  definitely  strengthen  the  University's  recognition  as  a  Global               University.                     2020 will mark the realization of the University’s goal of becoming a global university.               As a testament of its status as a Global Research University, it will venture to international              collaborative researches and development activities in Science, Technology, Engineering,               Agriculture and Mathematics with ASEAN universities and organizations. The University will              also open its doors to foreign students since the Mutual Recognition Agreement (MRA) in               selected  programs  is  in  place.  Visiting  professors/affiliate  professors  from  leading              u1liversities  will  be  invited  to  further  enhance  the  quality  of  instruction  and  research.

There are four major goals of the revised plan. These are:                          Goal 1. Institutionalize Program Quality Assurance                          Quality assurance is a prerequisite towards creating excellent programs that will               produce  graduates  who  are  highly  competent  to  enter  global  workforce.  Among  the               indicators  used  in  determining  the  program  quality  are:  AACCUP  accreditation  status,              CHED COE/COD recognition, government recognition and compliance to CHED standards.

Nurture the Culture of Academic Excellence                    Academic  excellence  is  the  hallmark  of  a  global  university.  As  a  premier  university,              CvSU is strongly committed in supporting the culture of academic excellence. This can be               achieved by pursuing global education, enhancing faculty and staff development programs,              upgrading  of  facilities,  ensuring  the  employability  of  graduates  and  production  of  quality               instructional materials that are anchored on Outcomes; Based Education.

C.  Strengthen the Culture of Research Excellence                   In  achieving  the  Global  University  status,  CAFENR  is  mandated  to  ensure  that  all               agricultural researches are undertaken for maximum utility of its clientele,  particularly the              fanners. Research is the comer stone of a global university. Despite challenges such lack of               funds  and  limited  time  allotment  due  to  conflict  in  faculty  academic  schedule,  CAFENR              continuously strive to inculcate to its academic personnel the value of conducting relevant               researches.

Sustain the Culture of Excellence in Extension and Community Involvement                   CAFENR’s continuing active participation in the extension service to the community is               very evident in the active involvement of faculty, staff and students. Local communities are              the  prime  recipients  of  numerous  projects  geared  toward  community  development.               Programs  for  livelihood  creation  through  income  generating  projects,  environmental              sustainability information campaigns, and agricultural technology dissemination efforts are               the main goals of CAFENR’s extension and community linkaging. This \"public engagement\"              is the proactive way of reaching out to the less-informed and under-privileged members of               society.                   In the last five years, CAFENR conducted 30 high-impact seminars on several topics               of interest specifically designed for farmers not only in Cavite but also in communities as far              as Sorsogon and Oriental  Mindoro and to urban areas such as Taguig City and Quezon              City.  To  showcase  the  products,  the  college  joined  local  and  national  trade  fairs  and               exhibits whenever opportunities allow. However, the selfless efforts and noble intentions of              the college are not enough if they will not enhance the extension endeavours with proven               and  tested  technologies.  Hence,  the  research  and  extension  units  of  the  college  should              come  up  with  printed  materials  and  easy  to  follow  instructions  materials  to  cater  to  the               needs  of  target  clients.  In  addition,  the  faculty  members  should  continue  serving  as              resource  persons  whenever  their  expertise  is  greatly  needed.

Planning  process  is  concerted,  participative  and  interdependent  activity  of  all                  units of the University.                     Adding a broad range of perspectives into the planning process allows the University              to  capture  the  expertise  of  front-line  and  implementation-level  personnel  while  also              capturing  crucial  information  from  the  various  stakeholders  (e.g.  the  industry).  CvSU               strategic planning ensures carefully designed participation and periodic input from all levels               of university personnel and stakeholders.              2.   Bottoms-up and Top-down approaches are employed.                     Two different approaches have been adopted in drafting the strategic plan: the first is               a  'top-down'  approach  wherein  the  administrators  provide  the  direction  for  the  strategic              planning.  The  second  is  a  'bottom-up'  approach,  which  begins  with  those  who  are  most               affected by the issues and attempts to inductively develop plans and recommendations.                     A University Strategic Plan, no matter how well developed, will be of minimal use if it               fails to each those to whom it is directed. And even if it does somehow reach the faculty,              staff, students and other stakeholders, there will always be the risk that the message will go              unheard or be misiuterp1ded as it moves its way through bureaucracy. On the other hand,               bottom-up  approaches  are  not  without  their  own  set  of  challenges;  like  any  case-based              approach, there are risks of generalizing from a limited and particular set of facts to a policy               framework intended to cover a comprehensive set of cases. What is gained in depth from              the granular detail achieved by understanding the local context may be lost when a policy               based on that single case is widely disseminated.                     Top  to  bottom  approach  may  be  more  practical  for  concerns  which  may  need  the               expertise of the top level management who are more knowledgeable about issues that may              affect the entire University and not just few w1its. As such, fusion of the two approaches               may in the end produce the intended results.                                                                                                     Page | 36","3.   Formulation of development agenda considers the inputs of the councils of the                  University.                   The  University  has  three  councils,  namely:  academic,  research  and  extension  and               administrative.  These  councils  contribute  to  ensuring  consultancy,  co-involvement  and              dialogue regarding academic, research and extension and administrative issues. The three              councils participate in strategic planning by endorsing policy and procedures; and advising               on  matters  relating  to:  academics,  academic  support  services,  research,  extension  and               development  activities,  enrolment  services,  resource  management,  administration  of              colleges and campuses and distance learning, assessment, and fiscal planning.              4.   The  agenda  are  cascaded  to  the  different  units  and  who  in  turn  formulate                  strategic plans in support of the University Agenda.                   The different units of the University prepare their strategic plans based on the agenda              set by the administration. CAFENR, for instance, have conducted its own strategic planning              with the thrust \"Achieving global recognition in  Agriculture, Entrepreneurship, Food               Technology  and  Environmental  Science\".  The  departments  under  the  college  crafted              their  plans  in  support  of  the  college  agenda  In  addition,  the  departments  prepare  their               operational  plans for  each  year to  ensure that targets are accomplished  within the  given              time.               5.   Strong coordination among the different units is practiced to ensure that plans                  are properly implemented.                   Involving different units in the planning process can help build broad support among              diverse constituents. In particular, the university planning units benefits from members that               represent a variety of institutional roles, demographic groups, and campus units. In addition              to  building  a  diverse  committee  helps  to  anticipate  the  future  cross-unit  coordination               necessary to carry out goals and objectives.

Colleges/Campuses and other operational units developed strategic plans aligned with               the  university  plan.  The  Planning  and  Development  Office  evaluates  the  plans  for              inconsistencies with the university plan. Recommendations are sent to the vice presidents              of each unit, who worked with the dean or director to refine the plans. The relevant vice               presidents recommend to the President all unit plans for approval prior to implementation.                    With  the  implementation  of  Strategic  Performance  Management  Systems  (SPMS),              each unit prepares its Office Performance Commitment and Review Form (OPCR) that  is              aligned to the approved strategic development plan. Faculty members and non-academic               personnel also prepare their Individual Performance Commitment and Review Forms that              are also aligned to the strategic development plan. Submission is done every semester to               ensure that relevant items in the plan are properly carried out.              7.   The  Planning  and  Development  Office  carefully  monitors  the  activities  of  all                  units.                   Monitoring  implementation,  tracking  progress,  and  revising  the  strategic  plan,  if               needed, are the very critical components in the successful attainment of University's goals.              These  steps  require  that  the  strategic  plan  include  measurable  criteria  for  success,               assessment methods, and dear accountability. In addition, it is important for the University              to routinely report its progress toward achieving its goals to all stakeholders.              8.   The University’s plans are consistently in consonance with the requirements of                  the overall regional and national development agenda and with CHED's Higher                  Education Reform Agenda (HERA).                   The  Director  of  the  Planning  and  Development  Office  strictly  monitors  the  planning              workshops to ensure that outputs are consistently in consonance with the requirements of              the overall regional and national development agenda and with CHED's Higher Education               Reform Agenda (HERA).                                                                                                       Page | 38","9.   Recommendations  made  during  Accreditation  Survey  Visits  are  considered  in                  crafting the CAFENR Revised Strategic Plan.                   The  accreditors'  recommendations  are  seriously  taken  into  consideration  during               strategic planning to ensure 100% compliance. The University President is very supportive              to  program  accreditation  requirements  and  generously  allocates  funds  to  ensure  full              compliance to the recommendations.
