                 selected laboratory courses for selected programs, which do not require face-to-face training to
                 master the skills to be taught; as well as on-the-job-training program and practice teaching that
                 can be done in a work from home arrangement at CvSU - Tanza Campus during the Second

                 The offering of such classes will also complement the completion of graduation requirements of
                 graduating students who were not able to enroll laboratory classes during the preceding semester.

               PROF. GIL D. RAMOS
               Campus Administrator
               CvSU Tanza Campus



               Dear Prof. Ramos,


               Good day!

               The Office of the Vice President for Research and Extension is currently conducting its
               Research and Extension Caravan among the different colleges and campuses of the
               university. The said caravan is a knowledge-sharing and learning caravan in the academic units
               of the university in order to get input from the different colleges and campuses of the university
               as we formulate a new Research and Extension Agenda for 2023-2028.

               Moreover, it aims to raise awareness in our academic units on the available facilities and
               equipment they may use in the conduct of research and extension, and identify the research
               and extension initiatives, concerns, and other input from academic units of colleges and
               campuses.

               In line with this, we would like to schedule a forum on your campus on October 26, 2022, from
               2:00 p.m. -4:00 p.m. May we also request your good office the data on the allocation of funds
               for research and extension activities of your campus for 2023 and the budget utilization for
               2021 on or before October 25, 2022.


               We are hoping for your positive response to this endeavor. Thank you and we look forward to
               working with you.



               Respectfully yours,
