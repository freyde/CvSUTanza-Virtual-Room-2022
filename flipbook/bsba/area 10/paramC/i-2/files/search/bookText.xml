               Dear Prof. Ramos,
               Good day Sir! We, the Central Student Government of Cavite State University- Tanza Campus
               are humbly asking for your approval to conduct a “Virtual Winter Wonderland Year End 2021”
               Theme: Engaged in New Beginnings to Remarkable Possibilities. This is a Christmas
               tradition that our campus has every year in December. The virtual year-end celebration is an
               occasion for students and teachers to reflect on the previous year, set new goals, and make
               plans for the coming year. This is also an occasion for them to send each other good wishes
               and express gratitude to all who have contributed in the previous year. All activities for this
               event will be virtual and will promote solidarity to the community.



               Attached are the proposed events; program of activities; and working committees for the said
               activity



               Hoping for your positive response. Thank you and God bless!


               Respectfully yours,



               CHRISTINE JEWEL R. GALLOS

                   new beginnings, mending, giving, and sharing the possibilities that will arise in the future
                   year. Virtual Year End is one of the events that College students look forward to, as the

                   activities, including surprise raffle presents, contests, and performances, to give Tanza
                   Campus students a great Year-end in 2021.
