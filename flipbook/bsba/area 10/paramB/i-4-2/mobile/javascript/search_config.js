These trends are significant to meet                the future needs and challenges in education through the pervasive application of Information and                Communication Technology (ICT).  In addition, the emergence of COVID-19 pandemic and the                imminent presence of different COVID-19 variants (Delta) brought unforeseen disruptions in                the lives of people all over the world.  The Philippine higher education institutions (HEIs) are                no exemption in facing such critical situations.  To ensure the continuity of learning among                tertiary students while avoiding and/or limiting the risks of infection in the community, HEIs                explored and shifted to other innovative learning modalities that transmigrate the conduct of                classes  from  traditional  to  flexible  learning  modalities,  which  gave  students  the  option  to                choose the most convenient delivery modes to them.  This flexible learning modality emerged                during the First Semester of Academic Year 2020–2021 where it was used for the conduct of                lecture classes, leaving behind the conduct of laboratory classes that require a more rigid                training for students in face-to-face classes.                         As CvSU Tanza increases its enrolment during the First Semester of AY 2021 – 2022, from                1,154 students last year now caters a projected 1700 enrollees, thus compelling the campus to                hire additional faculty members. With this, there is an urgent need to conduct faculty orientation                and re-orientation and further explore other innovative flexible learning modalities that suit the                capacity, capability, and connectivity of our teachers and learners.                 Objectives                        The activity aims to provide our faculty members with additional information and enhance                different ways on  flexible  learning  modality of education delivery  with  the aid of  ICT and new                technologies.
