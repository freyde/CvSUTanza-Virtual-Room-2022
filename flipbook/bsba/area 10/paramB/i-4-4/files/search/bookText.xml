             I.   Project Description

                  Title           :  BAGTAS with CvSU-Tanza
                                      (Bagtas ay Aasenso at Giginhawa kung Tayo Ay Sama-sama with
                                      CvSU -Tanza)

                  Location        :  Brgy. Bagtas, Tanza, Cavite

                  Proponent       :  Cavite State University – Tanza Campus

                  Beneficiaries   :  Out-of-school Children and Youth, Brgy. Officials, and non-working
                                         members of the community

                  Project Components:
                           Program 1:  Oplan Karunungan
                           Program 2:    Computer Literacy Program
                           Program 3:  Livelihood Programs for Non-Working Members of the Community
                           Program 4:  Health and Wellness

                  Partner Agencies: Local Government Unit of the Municipality of Tanza, Cavite; Provincial
                                          Cooperative, Livelihood, and Entrepreneurial Development Office
                                          (PCLEDO); Farmers Training Center (FITS); Companies in
                                          Export Processing Zone Authority (EPZA)

                  Estimated Budget: Php 610,000

                  Duration        :  5 years

             II.  Rationale       :

                         The population explosion in Brgy. Bagtas has led to an initiative to alleviate poverty in the
                  barangay.  Brgy. Bagtas, having the most number of populations in Tanza (20,370 out of 188,755),
                  has been the site for relocation and reclamation.  However, people, who were displaced out of their
                  previous addresses, were relocated in the said barangay without having a regular source of living.
                  Some of them could not find a decent job because they lack the educational and other requirements
                  for the job that they were applying for. Others could not start any business because they lack the]]></page><page Index="13"><![CDATA[skills  in  preparing  innovative  products  that  could  help  them  earn  additional  income  for  their
                  families.

                         Thus, different extension activities are being proposed to increase the quality of life of the
                  citizens in the said barangay. Non-formal education will help out-of-school children to be able to
                  read, write and count. Also, livelihood programs deemed to strengthen housewives skills and at
                  the  same  time,  augment  the  meager  income  of  their  families.  In  addition,  awareness  drives
                  concerning health and other GAD-related issues are being proposed to inculcate the importance of
                  appropriate living condition for every member of the community.

             III.  Strategies of Implementation

                  A.  Formation of Committee
                             A committee was formed to study and gather benchmark information on the status,
                      needs, and conditions of selected communities in Tanza, Cavite during the second semester,
                      AY  2014  –  2015.  The  committee  was  headed  by the  Extension  Coordinator.  Two  faculty
                      members  from  the  different  departments  of  the  campus  were  selected  as  members  of  the
                      committee to ensure that the programs will conform to the mandate of the university. The
                      committee used the following benchmark information, provided by Tanza Municipal Planning
                      and Development Office (TMPDO), in order to assess which group of individuals will be the
                      target beneficiaries of the proposal.

                             The committee used the descriptive design of a study. Data utilized in the study mainly
                      came from the responses on the self-administered survey questions that were distributed to the
                      residents of Brgy. Bagtas.  Residents were selected using simple random sampling.

                             Results revealed that:

                                •  87.14% of the residents perceived that they lack regular sources of living in the
                                    barangay because most (48.15%) of them lack the educational requirements and
                                    some (38.99%) lack the technical skills to either start a small business or to
                                    apply for a regular job;]]></page><page Index="14"><![CDATA[•  47.06%  of  the  residents  believed  that  these  problems  and  issues  may  be
                                    addressed through conduct of free seminars/trainings on livelihood programs;

                                •  18.33% of the residents suggested to conduct free seminar on candle making;
                                    17.33% suggested soap making; 15.33% suggested delicacy preparation such as
                                    yema, ube, leche flan, puto, and others; 13.67% suggested dishwashing liquid
                                    making; 13.00% suggested recycling of plastic products and water lily bags;
                                    while the remaining 8.67% suggested perfume-making;

                                •  46.50% of the residents said that they have baking and cooking skills and they
                                    are willing to undergo trainings for delicacy preparation; also 22.50% reiterated
                                    that they have the skills in the arts and trades and that they are willing to undergo
                                    trainings  on  preparation  of  innovative  products  such  as  candle,  soap,  and
                                    dishwashing liquid;


                  B.  Preparation of Proposal
                             The proposal to conduct extension programs in the community was based upon the
                      respondent’s needs and interests that are consistent with the goals of the campus and that have
                      been identified through surveys.

                             Some programs relative to the needs and interests of the residents were not considered
                      due to insufficiencies on facilities and absence of qualified faculty members to handle such
                      programs. This includes recycling of plastic products, water lily bags, and perfume-making
                      which may require raw materials that are unavailable from the community.

                             While  having  consultative  meetings  with  the  local  government  of  the  concerned
                      barangay, some requests to the university were raised. First, the campus will have to offer
                      computer literacy program for their barangay officials and 4P’s members. This program aims
                      to extend computer literacy to the Brgy. Officials and selected 4P’s members, who, based on
                      observation, lack with sufficient skills in computer manipulation and processes. The LGU
                      believes  that  technical  skills  must  be  manifested  by  their  officials  to  better  serve  their
                      constituents and for those 4P’s members for employment and business opportunities.

                             Also, the LGU requested that the proponents offer literacy skills development among
                      their children. According to them, a number of children were not enrolled in a formal school
                      and parents of these children affirm that they could not send them in formal school due to lack
                      of financial resources, that although education is free in public schools, they could not provide
                      the requirements that their children must submit.

                             Another request from the LGU is that the proponent should give awareness campaigns
                      on different health issues. According to them, the increase in the rate of patients with dengue
                      and AIDS/HIV in the province had been alarming them and the residents. And because the
                      proponent  is  a  GAD  advocate,  GAD-related  issues  and  concerns  were  included  in  this
                      awareness campaign, such as Anti-Violence against Women and their Children (anti-VAWC),
                      sexual harassment among others.]]></page><page Index="15"><![CDATA[C.  Meeting of the Committee
                             A meeting of the campus Committee on Curriculum and Instruction was conducted on
                      April 10, 2015 to deliberate on the proposed extension programs in the campus.

                                               were absent                             :      0

                                        Number of Members in favor of the
                                               proposal                                :      15

                                        Number of Members not in favor of the
                                               proposal                                :      0
