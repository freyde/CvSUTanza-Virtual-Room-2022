               Nilalaman:     Pagtatalaga ng Head of Party- Lakbay-Aral 2022

               Petsa:         Agosto 5, 2022

               Sanhi ng pangkalusugang kadahilan (A3 ang aking klasipikasyon sa Covid 19 vaccine) minarapat
               kong hindi sumama sa nakatakda nating  Lakbay-Aral na gaganapin mula-Agosto 10 hanggang
               12, 2022. Kaugnay nito, aking itinatalaga  si  Gng. Debbie Rose Banag-Fabian bilang  Head of
               Party  ng nasabing gawain kapalit ng inyong Tagapangasiwa ng Kampus.

               Ibig nitong sabihin, lahat ng kaukulang pangangalaga sa grupo, kabilang na ang mga desisyong
               gagawin    na  may  kinalaman  sa  nasabing  Lakbay-Aral  ay  kay  Gng.  Fabian  manggagaling
               pagkatapos masangguni ang mga kasamahang Puno ng Departamento.

               Inaasahan ko rin ang pagtalima at kooperasyon ng bawat isa sa itinalagang Head of Party at ang
               inyong patuloy na pagsunod sa nakagawian na natin na safety protocol sa panahon ng Lakbay -
               Aral. Tandaan din na hindi lamang paglilibang ang pakay ng ating gawain kundi pati na rin ang
               Team Building. Nawaý matamo natin ang mga ito sa kabila ng kaukulang pag-iingat ng bawat isa.]]></page><page Index="10"><![CDATA[Republic of the Philippines

         82               The  meeting  started  at  1:30  PM  with  Prof.  Gil  D.  Ramos  as  the  presiding
         83        officer.  Before he officially discussed the main agenda of the meeting, he requested
         84        Mr. Mark Sibulo to lead a prayer. After this, he go through the agenda of the meeting.
         85               He asked the group who are still not vaccinated and encouraged everyone to
         86        get full vaccine against COVID-19. He then asked each chair of the departments to
         87        report. Mr. Mark Sibulo, reported about the successful conduct of final examinations
         88        under  the  Department  of  Arts  and  Sciences.  The  faculty  loading  was  also  already
         89        accepted by the faculty members. He shared that there was a conflict between a faculty
         90        and student but they already resolved it. Prof. Sebastian, chair of Teacher Education
         91        Department, shared that there is no major problem in the department except the request
         92        of faculty members to extend the submission of their requirements. She also reported
         93        that  all  faculty  members  under  the  TED  got  Very  Satisfactory  rating  in  the  recent
         94        students’  evaluation  for  teachers.  She  added  that  Ms.  Tagle,  faculty  from  the
         95        department, presented in an international conference. She also shared the successful
         96        conduct of online teaching demo of BSE students and the recognition of the student
         97        organization of Education students, being registered in Provincial Youth Development
         98        Office. She also reported an update on the date of COPC evaluation of BSE and BSBM

        101        attainment.
        102               Before proceeding to the reports of other departments, Prof. Ramos asked the
        103        group to come up with a proposal on course offering of the campus that is different from
        104        the courses offered by the nearby campuses. He suggested that the DAS should have
        105        its own program offering like a program majoring in Philosophy.
        106               Ms. Senaris then continued the report. She shared about the successful conduct
        107        of class observation and the department has a group chat for issues or concerns of the
        108        faculty. She raised a concern about the decreasing number of students who attend their
        109        classes and that they were not turning their cameras on during synchronous classes.
        110        She also reported that all faculty members under the DIT got a Very Satisfactory rating
        111        from the students. On the other hand, she is still waiting for the grading sheets of the

         53               The meeting started at 3:00 PM with Prof. Gil D. Ramos as the presiding officer.  Before
         54        he officially discussed the main agenda of the meeting, he had some announcements for the
         55        group based on the administrative council meeting that was held the other day.  He announced
         56        that the campus water supply will be provided by the Office of the ABC President, Hon. SM]]></page><page Index="23"><![CDATA[57        Matro.  He also announced that the PhP4.5-million allotment for the two-storey building of

         64
         65               Another  concern  that  was  being  raised  during  the  Administrative  Council  was  the
         66        complaints through the 8888.  Most of Contract of Service (COS) Faculty members were filing
         67        concerns regarding the delay of salaries.  He sympathized with those faculty members but he
         68        mentioned that these faculty members must expedite all possible means to complete their
         69        requirements in order not to delay their salaries.
         70
         71               He  announced  that  each  faculty  member  shall  give  major  examinations,  such  as
         72        midterm and final exams in line with the school calendar.  However, faculty members shall
         73        have the leeway on when to give their midterm examination, depending on the lessons that

         77        being posted in the Facebook. This was discussed during the Administrative Council Meeting.
         78        He  requested  everyone  to  help  the  campus  in  tracking  down  the  source  or  production  of
         79        falsified documents.
         80
         81               He announced that there will be also class observation after the midterm examination.
         82        He requested everyone to submit their schedule of classes for the classroom observation.  This
         83        shall be the basis for re-hiring of faculty members for the next semester.
         84
         85               He  announced  that  the  Office  of  the  University  President  request  each  campus  to
         86        prepare  its  dashboard  of  information.    This  shall  include  all  primary  tools  and  general
         87        information about CvSU Tanza Campus.  He assigned the MIS officer and the four department
         88        chairpersons to take charge of this task.
