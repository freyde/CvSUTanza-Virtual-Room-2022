                       MEMBERS AND EMPLOYEES

                       Step 1. Identification of Vacant Position

                       The selection process begins when a position becomes vacant or a new position is
                       created. Based on the University’s Plantilla of Positions, the HRDO shall make a list
                       of vacant positions.

                       In the case of academic position under the contract of service status, the College or
                       Campus shall identify the vacancy based on faculty analysis. The College or Campus
                       shall submit a request letter to hire the identified number of needed faculty members
                       to the Office of the University President thru channels.

                       An approved letter of request by the University President for the additional need of
                       faculty members from colleges and branch campuses shall be forwarded to the HRDO
                       by the concerned college or campus for review of the qualification standards for faculty
                       members  per  discipline  based  on  the  University  Merit  System  and  Civil  Service
                       Commission Qualification Standards (QS) and for publication.

                        The HRDO shall prepare the Request for Publication of Vacant Positions for approval
                        of the University President.

                        The vacancy posting shall contain the following EEOP statement: “The University
                        highly encourages all interested and QUALIFIED applicants including persons with
                        disability (PWD), members of indigenous communities, and those with diverse sexual
                        orientation, gender identity and expression (SOGIE), to apply.” (PRIME-HRM ML II)

                       The qualification standards of the parenthetical title should be used in the publication
                       of vacant generic positions (Sec. 27, CSC MC No. 24, s. 2017, as amended).

                       (Section 24, CSC MC No. 24, s. 2017, as amended).

                       The HRDO shall submit the list of vacant positions authorized to be filled and their

                        the written examination rating form. Should the ratings given by the raters widely
                        differ and whenever practicable, the raters shall convene to calibrate and come up
                        with a consensus rating.

                        interview, the panel of interviewers shall discuss and identify the competencies each
                        of  them  will  focus  on  and  use  an  assessment  tool  to  rate  the  responses  of  the
                        interviewees.

                        The HRMPSB shall:
                            ● Conduct (Behavioral Event) INTERVIEW to the applicants
                            ● Assess the COMPETENCY, POTENTIAL AND PERSONALITY TRAITS of the
                            applicants

                        The panel of interviewers shall calibrate and come up with a consensus rating. They
                        shall likewise agree on the brief competency narrative report following the Situation,
                        Tasks,  Actions,  and  Results  (STAR)  format  to  justify  the  rating  given  to  the
                        applicants.

                        that may be adopted by the HRMPSB.

                       Step 10. Conduct Background Investigation (BI)

                       The Background Investigation aims to get vital information on the applicant, such as
                       but not limited to, competencies, performance records and other information that may
                       affect or predict performance. The information shall likewise supplement or validate
                       assessments done on the applicant’s competencies.


                         ●  The BI shall be done either through face-to-face interview, phone interview or
                            using feedback form.

                         ●  Only the top five (5) applicants shall be subjected to the BI by the  HRDO-RSP.

                         ●  The BI shall cover the following roles of the applicants: As a person, as a worker
                            and as a peer, subordinate and/or supervisor. A 360-degree assessment may be
                            adopted to include applicant’s supervisors, peers and subordinates in the current
                            or previous employment. For applicants who are fresh graduates or have no
                            employment record, the BI shall be conducted in the school where the applicants
                            graduated. Respondents in the BI will also include the references indicated in
                            the form submitted.

                                              EXCELLENCE (CvSU- PRAISE)

                   In line with the Revised Policies on Employee Suggestions and Incentives Awards System
                   (ESIAS) provided under CSC Resolution No. 01-0112 and CSC MC No. 01, s. 2001, CSC
                   MC 6, s. 2002, CSC MC 18, s. 2012, EO 201, s. 2016, and CSC MC No. 01, s. 2019,  the
                   University  adopts  the  herein  Revised  Program  on  Awards  and  Incentives  for  Service
                   Excellence (PRAISE) to be referred to as CvSU PRAISE.


                   I.  BASIC POLICIES

                   1.  The  University shall establish its own employee suggestions and incentive awards
                       system.

                   2.  The   System shall  be designed  to  encourage creativity,  innovativeness,  efficiency,
                       integrity and productivity in the public service by recognizing and rewarding officials
                       and employees, individually or in groups for their suggestions, inventions, superior
                       accomplishments  and  other  personal  efforts  which  contribute  to  the  efficiency,
                       economy or other improvement in government operations, or for other extraordinary
                       acts or services in the public interest.

                   3.  The  CvSU PRAISE shall adhere to the principle of providing incentives and awards
                       based on performance, innovative ideas, and exemplary behavior.

                   4.  The  CvSU  PRAISE  shall  give  emphasis  on  the  timeliness  of  giving  award  or
                       recognition.  Aside  from  conferment  of  awards  during  the  traditional  or  planned
                       awarding  ceremonies,  the  spirit  of  on-the-spot  grant  of  recognition  shall  be
                       institutionalized.

                   5.  The  CvSU  PRAISE  shall  provide  both  monetary  and  non-monetary  awards  and
                       incentives to recognized, acknowledge and reward productive, creative,  innovative,
                       and ethical behavior of employees through formal and informal mode.

                          For this purpose, the CvSU PRAISE shall encourage the grant of non-monetary
                          awards. Monetary awards shall be granted only when the suggestions, inventions,
                          superior accomplishments, and other personal efforts result in monetary savings
                          which shall not exceed 20% of the savings generated.

                   6.  The PRAISE shall be institutionalized through the creation of a PRAISE Committee.


                   7.  The PRAISE Committee shall ensure that productivity, innovative ideas, suggestions,
                       and exemplary behavior can be identified, considered, managed, and implemented on
                       a continuing basis to cover employees at all levels.


                   8.  The  PRAISE  Committee shall  establish its  own  internal  procedures  and strategies
                       which may  be  independent  from  but not  contrary  to  CSC established  rules  as  the
                       committee deems applicable. Membership in the Committee shall be considered part
                       of the member’s regular duties and functions.

                   9.  The University shall submit this CvSU PRAISE and its subsequent amendments to the
                       CSCRO IV. The Civil Service Commission Regional Office No. IV and/or CSC Cavite
                       Field Office shall provide technical assistance, if deemed necessary, to ensure proper
                       implementation
                                                                                                  Page 1 of 23]]></page><page Index="51"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY REVISED PRAISE

                         Committee –  refers to the designated CvSU PRAISE Committee.

                         Contribution  –  any  input  which  can  be  in  the  form  of  an  idea,  invention,  or

                         people, unhampered by artificial barriers or prejudices or preferences, except when
                         particular distinctions can be explicitly justified (Jonsen, et.al 2015); an ideal state in
                         which everyone has the same chance to participate and succeed in any aspect of
                         their work and lives (Westen, 1985).

                         assigned  at  birth.  However,  some  people  have  a  gender  identity  or  gender
                         expression that is different from their sex assigned at birth; these people might use
                         the term "transgender" or "gender non-conforming" to describe their gender identity.

                         employee  for  contributions,  suggestions,  inventions,  ideas,  satisfactory
                         accomplishment,  or  demonstration  of  exemplary  behavior  based  on  agreed
                         performance standards and norms of behavior.

                         Invention – the creation of something previously non-existent which will benefit the
