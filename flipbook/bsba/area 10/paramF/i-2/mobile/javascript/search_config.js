These are              correspondence and financial documents. These documents are entirely different from              each other, thus, they are recorded on separate logbooks.                    On the other hand, correspondence are written communications which are further              classified into incoming and outgoing communication (See Figure 8). Incoming              communications are those coming from outside the office while outgoing communications              are those that originate from the office.                 FLOW OF COMMUNICATION                    Incoming documents are forwarded to the Records Office for evaluation, stamping and              assignment of document/reference number. Documents are stamped with date received              and initialed by the receiving personnel. (See Figure 8.1). Important information about the              documents is recorded in the logbook including the origin, the particulars of the request,              the date of receipt, the office sent to and the date of release. (See Figure 8.2). The              communication is forwarded to OVPASS or OVPAA for recommending approval depending              upon the nature of the incoming communication. Documents that are academic in nature              are forwarded to OVPAA while documents that are administrative in nature are forwarded              to OVPASS for appropriate action. Before signing however, the documents are checked if              they are in order. In the event that there is a need for some clarification, or there are some              requirements that need to be complied with, OVPAA/OVPASS send back the              communication to the Records Office. The Records Office in turn, sends the              communication back to the origin after the date of release and remark/notation of the              signing officer has been recorded in the logbook. After complying with the              remarks/requirements, the document is then returned to the Records Office, after which the              same document will be transmitted to OVPAA/OVPASS for recommending approval and              finally to the OP for approval.                    Upon approval, the communication is returned to the Records Office wherein the same              shall be released to the office, individual concerned after such action of the document has              been recorded in the logbook including the date of release.

Upon submission              to the Records Office, the Records Officer evaluates all the documents (See Figure 7.1).              All required signatures and required documents are scrutinized as to completeness. RIV              with incomplete requirements are sent back to origin.
