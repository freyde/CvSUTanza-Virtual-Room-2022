                          The meeting started at 1:35 PM with Prof. Gil D. Ramos as the presiding officer.  Before
                   he officially discussed the main agenda of the meeting, he commended the group for the good
                   feedback the campus received during the recently held commencement exercises. He also
                   congratulated  the  faculty  members  who  will  be  promoted  with  the  NBC  461  8   Cycle  and
                                                                                              th
                   thanked Ms. Sebastian for her time and effort in assisting the faculty members in preparing
                   and submitting the necessary documents for NBC.
                          The  meeting  then  proceeded  to  the  main  agenda.  He  asked  the  chairs  of  each
                   department to report. Mr. Banate, the department chair of the Department of Management
                   reported that one of the recently hired faculty members of their department has backed out
                   and they already posted a hiring notice. However, they only got one applicant. Prof. Ramos
                   advised  to  welcome  even  fresh  graduates  to  apply,  especially  those  who  graduated  with
                   honors.
                          Ms. Senaris, the chair of the Department of Information Technology, then reported that
                   they already successfully filled the necessary number of faculty members in the department.
                   Ms. Sebastian, the chair of the Teacher Education Department also reported that they already
                   have  complete  number  of  faculty  members.  She  then  opened  her  concern  about  the
                   deployment of their students as practice teachers for face-to-face teaching. She asked if they
                   can  hold  a  face-to-face  demonstration  teaching  in  the  campus  for  them  to  assess  their
                   students’ readiness, knowledge, and skills in actual teaching, before their deployment. This will
                   be held for 3 days, with 42 Education students and they plan to start the activity the following]]></page><page Index="16"><![CDATA[week. Prof. Ramos approved the request and advised that they may not deploy the students
                   who will not pass their assessment.
                          Ms. Fabian then reported about the recruitment of faculty members for the Department
                   of Arts and Sciences being completed. She also said that the Job Order  faculty members
                   especially  the  newly  hired  should  submit  their  requirements  as  soon  as  possible  for  their
                   contracts.
                          In line with the preparation of the opening of classes, Prof. Ramos asked the faculty
                   members  to  follow  the  prescribed  syllabus  in  their  handled  courses.  He  then  asked  Ms.
                   Sebastian about any updates regarding the NBC. Ms. Sebastian told the group that those who
                   will be promoted to one to three steps are already certain of the reclassification while those
                   who will be promoted to at least four steps will still wait for BOR approval.
                          The meeting then proceeded to the next agenda which is the admission and enrolment.
                   Ms. Perida, the campus registrar, reported that there are 556 qualified first year students who
                   already confirmed their slots but only 369 of them submitted the necessary requirements. Prof.
                   Ramos then asked Ms. Perida to extend the deadline of requirements until September 16,
                   2022, Friday. Ms. Perida then added that there are already 1200 old students enrolled. She
                   also reported that there are four students who requested transfer credentials to transfer to
                   CvSU-Cavite City campus but currently requesting to return to the campus because they were
                   not able to secure their slots in Cavite City. However, because their transfer credentials were
                   already signed and released, their request to return were not granted.
                          Prof. Ramos then opened the next agenda which is the campus designation. He told
                   the  group  that  the  campus  needs  reappointment  of  designations.  First,  he  will  be  the
                   department chair of the Department of Arts and Sciences but Mr. Mark Joel Sibulo will help
                   him perform his duties as chair. Second, Ms. Sebastian will still be the research coordinator of
                   the campus. He then told the group to include the performance of their designations as one of
                   their priorities. He announced that Dr. Polinga already approved the designation of the staff to
                   administrative positions.
                          He also announced that the campus will no longer have an official campus vehicle
                   because he already returned it to the main campus. Proceeding to the next agenda, he asked
                   TED to get an update about English Critic accreditation to have additional accredited English
                   Critic in the campus.
                          For the next agenda, he announced that it was already allowed to use textbooks and
                   he suggested that the campus sell textbooks as an income-generating project. Prof. Ramos
                   recommended his books to be sold but reminded that the students should not be required to
                   buy the textbooks that the campus will sell.
                          Prof. Ramos shared to the group that the main campus will be having an extension
                   program in Brgy. Bagtas which is planting kaong. They plan to hold a transfer of technology to
                   Bagtas residents, specifically the production of vinegar and sugar from kaong. Prof. Ramos
                   suggested that the campus anchor its extension program to this activity of the main campus.
                   However, Ms. Villa, the extension program coordinator of the campus told the group that there
                   is already an approved campus extension program.
                          Other matters discussed during the meeting includes the request of Prof. Ramos to
                   have a copy of the raw data of the monthly attendance report of the faculty. He added that in
                   line with the new HR Memo on work arrangement, the faculty members will continue to follow
                   their alternative work arrangement schedule (two days WFH and two days campus reporting)
                   while  the  non-academic  staff  will  be  reporting  to  the  campus  four  days  a  week.  He  then
                   announced that Ms. Fabian and Mr. Fred will be the liaison officers.
                          After  this,  Prof.  Ramos  shared  some  reminders  for  the  opening  of  classes.  He
                   reminded the group to be not too lenient to the students. With this, Ms. Sebastian shared that
                   the TED will be starting to require student attendance to class meetings.
                          The meeting adjourned at 2:54 PM.

                          The  meeting  started  at  10:00  AM  with  Prof.  Gil  D.  Ramos  as  the  presiding
                   officer.   Before  he  officially  discussed  the  main  agenda  of  the  meeting,  he  requested  Mr.
                   Crisostomo Sibulo to lead a prayer. After this, he go through the agenda of the meeting.
                          He asked the group about the status of preparation for COPC. Ms. Sebastian reported
                   that the preparation is already 80% completed but they are having problems with the facility of
                   the campus. She proposed that the faculty room be used as laboratory and lecture rooms. The
                   campus  was  able  to  borrow  30  computers  from  the  students  and  proposed  to  have  a
                   memorandum of agreement with Bagtas Elementary School and Tanza National Trade School
                   for borrowing of additional computers.
                          Prof. Ramos opened the concern about the P5,000 being requested by the Department
                   of Information Technology for the installation of tiles in the computer laboratory and shared to
                   the  group  that  he  already  asked  Dr.  Manuel  about  it  and  was  told  that  the  requested
                   improvement  is  not  required.  He  then  asked  about  update  on  the  requested  purchase  of
                   equipment and facilities for accreditation. Ms. Sebastian reported that Dr. Polinga held over
                   the purchase request because the campus has no available space. Prof. Ramos then told the
                   group that because there is lack of support from the administration, the campus can document
                   whatever is available in the campus and use the result of evaluation as the basis of what to
                   improve in the campus. After this, Ms. Senaris shared the problem of the department about
                   the lack of faculty member with master’s degree and reported that she included Ms. Lewis from
                   Trece Martires City Campus to the list of faculty.
                          Prof.  Ramos  then  shared  that  the  donated  lot  for  Tanza  Campus  was  already
                   presented during the academic council meeting. He also shared to the group that he already
                   requested to the OVPAA that the campus will continue to hold online classes because of the
                   lack  of  campus  facilities.  Mr.  Mark  Sibulo  then  asked  if  there  is  already  a  target  date  of
                   constructing the new campus building. Prof. Ramos answered that there  is still no concrete
                   schedule about the construction.
                          Mr. Banate then reported about their department’s preparation for COPC. He shared
                   that he is already finalizing the presentation and was able to borrow faculty from the main
                   campus resulting to 84% faculty members having master’s degree. He then told Prof. Ramos
                   that Mr. Mintu, the Brgy. Bagtas Chairperson, is asking about the schedule of MOA signing
                   with the University for the lot donated to Tanza campus. Prof. Ramos said that it is still on
                   process of approval.]]></page><page Index="22"><![CDATA[Prof. Ramos then shared that the mock presentation of TED for COPC was postponed
                   but each department should continue their preparation. He also reminded the group to just
                   present what is available in the campus. He then asked for understanding for not being able to
                   go to the campus for health concerns and thanked the group for all their efforts.
                          After this, Ms. Banag presented the proposed streamlined designations.
                          Ms. Fabian then reminded the Contract of Service faculty members to submit authority
                   to go two days before the schedule because it needs to be submitted to different offices.
                          Prof. Ramos shared that the campus is not oblige to conduct a face-to-face class and
                   to  be  able  to  implement  limited  face-to-face,  the  campus  must  submit  the  necessary
                   documents for application for F2F and approval from the LGU is also necessary. The faculty
                   members  and  students  must  also  be  fully  vaccinated  and  the  students  should  have  their
                   parent’s consent.
                          Before the meeting ends, Ms. Addangna extended her gratitude to Ms. Sebastian, Mr.
                   Delgado, Ms. Fabian, and Mr. Mark Sibulo for being approachable.

         58        requested everyone to share any information regarding the meeting about the conduct of online
         59        OJT.  Ms. Mary Rose Elamparo attended the virtual OJT meeting for the BSBM program. She
         60        announced that they were able to prepare the proposal for further endorsement and approval
         61        of the University Academic council to the Board of Regents.  It was reiterated that OJT shall
         62        be conducted online and the campus may accommodate OJT students in the campus but to
         63        ensure that the tasks are aligned to the program where the students are enrolled.
         64
         65               Ms. Mildred A. Sebastian mentioned that there will also be virtual student teaching
         66        internship for the coming first semester, but BSE students shall complete first the first two field
         67        studies  (EDFS  21  and  EDFS  22)  before  they  could  conduct  their  online  student  teaching
         68        internship.  EDFS 21 is offered during the current semester, and EDFS 22 will be offered during
         69        the Midyear Term.
         70
         71               Ms. Maria Kristina Galicha announced that she attended the meeting for BSHM/BSTM
         72        programs.  They were able to formulate the proposal and guidelines for the virtual OJT but like
         73        the  other  programs,  the  proposal  is  yet  to  be  approved  and  further  information  shall  be
         74        announced sooner or later, depending on the results of the approval of the proposal.  Working
         75        students whose nature of jobs are aligned with their program of course may seek for credit of
         76        their OJT as long as the competencies for a particular skill are achieved.  In addition, Ms.
         77        Elamparo mentioned that BSHM/BSTM students who wished to conduct the OJT shall pay a
         78        minimum amount of PhP4,000 to complete their virtual OJT.  Due to this, she made a poll with
         79        the BSHM students if ever they would pursue the virtual OJT and pay the necessary amount.
         80        Based on the results, most of the students signified their non-intention to pursue the virtual
         81        OJT due to financial constraints.
         82
         83               Prof. Ramos announced that the CHED is now offering Scholarships for Instructors'
         84        Knowledge Advancement Program (SIKAP) for faculty members who wish to pursue graduate
         85        degree programs in CHED recognized schools. He mentioned that CHED Region IV-A Director
         86        Amelia Biglete encouraged everyone to pursue graduate degree programs in universities in
         87        the  CALABARZON  region.     Faculty  members  can  visit  the  CHED  website  for  further
         88        information.
         89
         90               Prof.  Ramos  announced  that  as  per  Director  Biglete,  the  First  National  Higher
         91        Education Day of the Commission on Higher Education will be held on May 7-21, 2021.  He
         92        will be sending the memorandum from the CHED in the group chat of the campus, where each
         93        campus of the university shall be enjoined to attend and participate.
         94
         95               Prof. Ramos inquired about the preparation of the documents relative to the COPC
         96        application of the campus.  The College of Education, Office of the Graduate School, Naic
         97        Campus and Carmona Campus had already finished the virtual validation.  Prof. Sebastian
         98        mentioned that the preparation of the said documents is on-going. There have been some
         99        problems encountered as regards some supplies and materials relative to the preparation.
        100        Prof. Ramos pledged that the funds shall be available in terms of the campus cash advance.
        101        However, Ms. Noemi Perida mentioned that she encountered difficulties in canvassing some
        102        supplies and materials because there was a tight budget.  Prof. Sebastian made mentioned
        103        that  the  group  also  find  it  difficult  to  get  certified  copies  of  faculty  credentials  since  the
        104        University Records Office does not certify copies of TOR and diploma who are not graduates
        105        of the university.  Also, faculty members cannot be compelled to travel and get their TOR and
        106        diploma as certified true copy.
        107
        108               Prof. Ramos announced that the class observation shall push through as planned.  This
        109        will be from May 10 – 13, 2021.  This shall serve as one of the evaluation requirements for re-
        110        hiring of faculty members.
        111
        112               Prof. Ramos was happy to know that every permanent and temporary faculty members
        113        are enjoying their workload.  He also announced that the deadline of submission for the Unified]]></page><page Index="25"><![CDATA[114        Workload  System  will  be  June  10,  2021  and  no  more  extension  shall  be  given.    Faculty
        115        members who are entitled to workload credits are advised to submit their workload documents
        116        before June 10, 2021 to avoid non-inclusion in the evaluation.
        117
        118               The admission of new students in the main campus already reached the 18,000-mark.
        119        However, they could only accommodate a total of 6,200 students in the different programs
        120        offered in the university. Those who will not qualify in the main campus will be transferred in
        121        the satellite campuses.
        122
        123               The meeting adjourned at 5:30 PM.

         52
         53               The meeting started at 3:00 PM with Prof. Gil D. Ramos as the presiding officer.  Before
         54        he officially discussed the main agenda of the meeting, he had some announcements for the
         55        group based on the administrative council meeting that was held the other day.  He announced
         56        that the campus water supply will be provided by the Office of the ABC President, Hon. SM]]></page><page Index="31"><![CDATA[57        Matro.  He also announced that the PhP4.5-million allotment for the two-storey building of
         58        CvSU Tanza Campus has been approved and that the group could expect its construction in
         59        the  near  future.    He  further  announced  that  the  PhP50-million  allotment  for the  3-5 storey
         60        building of the campus has been approved.  The campus shall seek the assistance of the
         61        Bagtas LGU for any donation of land to realize this vision, especially when the campus shall
         62        be subjecting four of its programs under the CHED visit to obtain the Certificates of Program
         63        Compliance.
         64
         65               Another  concern  that  was  being  raised  during  the  Administrative  Council  was  the
         66        complaints through the 8888.  Most of Contract of Service (COS) Faculty members were filing
         67        concerns regarding the delay of salaries.  He sympathized with those faculty members but he
         68        mentioned that these faculty members must expedite all possible means to complete their
         69        requirements in order not to delay their salaries.
         70
         71               He  announced  that  each  faculty  member  shall  give  major  examinations,  such  as
         72        midterm and final exams in line with the school calendar.  However, faculty members shall
         73        have the leeway on when to give their midterm examination, depending on the lessons that
         74        were already discussed.
         75
         76               Prof. Ramos shared to the group that there was an alleged Diploma Factory in Tanza,
         77        being posted in the Facebook. This was discussed during the Administrative Council Meeting.
         78        He  requested  everyone  to  help  the  campus  in  tracking  down  the  source  or  production  of
         79        falsified documents.
         80
         81               He announced that there will be also class observation after the midterm examination.
         82        He requested everyone to submit their schedule of classes for the classroom observation.  This
         83        shall be the basis for re-hiring of faculty members for the next semester.
         84
         85               He  announced  that  the  Office  of  the  University  President  request  each  campus  to
         86        prepare  its  dashboard  of  information.    This  shall  include  all  primary  tools  and  general
         87        information about CvSU Tanza Campus.  He assigned the MIS officer and the four department
         88        chairpersons to take charge of this task.
