By its records, agency              authenticates and keeps track of its day to day activities. Records also provide the material              for planners and implementers of future operations. Hence, the management and tracking              of records should be properly operated to better achieve one of the primary functions of              modern day organization - getting the right information, from the right person at the right              time and at a reasonable cost. Moreover, to ensure the effectiveness of this function,              proper system in records keeping and records tracking are necessary. The processing, use,              maintenance, storage and retrieval of these records are to be monitored closely.                  RECORDS MANAGEMENT IN GENERAL                      Records Defined                       Records refer to “any paper, book, photograph, motion picture, film, micro-film,                  sound, recording, drawing, chart, map or other document of any physical form or copy                  thereof that has been made or received by any entity or its successors as evidence of                  the objectives organizations, functions, policies, decisions, procedures, operations, or                  other activities of the government or because of the information contained therein”.                       Stated in another manner, records consist of all books, papers, maps, micro-film,                  motion pictures, magnetic tapes or other documentary materials made in physical form                  or characteristic and are made or received by any organization in pursuance of its legal                  obligation or in connection with the transaction of its proper business; and returned for                  short or long periods or preserved its evidence of its functions, policies, procedures,                  operations and other activities.                 Three Characteristics of Records are:                    1. They are tangible and can, thereof be seen and held;                  2.

Catalogues, trade journals, and other publications or paper received from other                      government agencies, commercial firms or private institutions which require no                      action and are part of a case upon which action is taken.                  7. Reproduction materials such as stencils, hectograph masters and offset plates.                  8. Stocks of publications or unused forms that are kept for supply purposes only.                 Non-Record Materials which can be discarded as soon as they are read and should never              reach the filing cabinet:                    1. Extra copies of documents preserved solely for convenience of for reference.                  2. Transmittal letters and acknowledgment which do not add any information to the                      materials transmitted.                  3.

Informal notes, worksheets or rough draft of letters, memoranda or reports that do                      not represent basic steps in the preparation of documents.                  5. Working papers, preliminary drafts and other similar materials which are                      summarized in final or other forms which has no evidential or information value                      once action has been completed.                  6.

Miscellaneous notices of agency affairs and employees’ meetings or holidays.                  8. Ticker or follow up correspondence.                 THE RECORDS OFFICE                   The Records office serve as the receiving and releasing arm of the university for official              correspondence, reports, memorandum and financial documents. It assigns reference              number for each document received to identify the communication and the date of receipt              as well as to transmission and routing of communication to the next action unit. It              authenticates, classifies, indexes, and files official documents of the university. It is also              responsible for the disposing papers that are no longer needed in accordance with the              existing rules and regulations. It also monitors the weekly accomplishment of              administrative personnel and submits reports to OVPASS. Finally, it provides accurate              information on the exact location or status of document within the offices of the              administration.                   The person in charge of the records office is the Records Officer who is responsible for              recording and tracking of documents received and released in the university.","There are two major classifications of documents in the existing system. These are              correspondence and financial documents. These documents are entirely different from              each other, thus, they are recorded on separate logbooks.                    On the other hand, correspondence are written communications which are further              classified into incoming and outgoing communication (See Figure 8). Incoming              communications are those coming from outside the office while outgoing communications              are those that originate from the office.                 FLOW OF COMMUNICATION                    Incoming documents are forwarded to the Records Office for evaluation, stamping and              assignment of document/reference number. Documents are stamped with date received              and initialed by the receiving personnel. (See Figure 8.1). Important information about the              documents is recorded in the logbook including the origin, the particulars of the request,              the date of receipt, the office sent to and the date of release. (See Figure 8.2). The              communication is forwarded to OVPASS or OVPAA for recommending approval depending              upon the nature of the incoming communication. Documents that are academic in nature              are forwarded to OVPAA while documents that are administrative in nature are forwarded              to OVPASS for appropriate action. Before signing however, the documents are checked if              they are in order. In the event that there is a need for some clarification, or there are some              requirements that need to be complied with, OVPAA/OVPASS send back the              communication to the Records Office. The Records Office in turn, sends the              communication back to the origin after the date of release and remark/notation of the              signing officer has been recorded in the logbook. After complying with the              remarks/requirements, the document is then returned to the Records Office, after which the              same document will be transmitted to OVPAA/OVPASS for recommending approval and              finally to the OP for approval.                    Upon approval, the communication is returned to the Records Office wherein the same              shall be released to the office, individual concerned after such action of the document has              been recorded in the logbook including the date of release. (See Figure 8).                 FINANCIAL DOCUMENTS                    Included in financial documents are Request and Issue Voucher (RIV), Request for              Allotment (ROA), Disbursement Voucher (DV), and Payroll.                  FLOW OF FINANCIAL DOCUMENTS                   Financial documents usually start as a Request and Issue Voucher (RIV) or a              Disbursement Voucher (DV) coupled with Request for Allotment (ROA). Upon submission              to the Records Office, the Records Officer evaluates all the documents (See Figure 7.1).              All required signatures and required documents are scrutinized as to completeness. RIV              with incomplete requirements are sent back to origin. After ascertaining the completeness              of requirements, the same is acknowledges receipt by indicating the date of receipt as well              as the initial of the receiver (see Figure 7.1.1). A reference number is assigned to each","document. Other necessary information such as the origin, date received, particulars, total              amount and requisitioner or claimant are then recorded in the financial logbook (see figure              7.1.2). A routing slip is attached to the document where the tracking information- is              recorded. Date of receipt and release in each of the offices where documents are              forwarded are clearly indicated in the routing slip.               After recording the needed information about the financial document on hand, it is              forwarded to the Supply Office. As aforementioned, the receiving personnel indicate the              date of receipt on the Routing Slip. The Supply Officer approves, signs and releases the              document to the Budget Office for appropriate funding.                The Budget Office appropriate funds based on the amount requested as reflected on the              Request for Obligation of Allotment (ROA). The date of release, any remarks about the              document and the office where it originated were recorded in the Routing Slip and              eventually the funded RIV and ROA are forwarded to the Supply Office for canvassing.               The Supply Office facilitates the serving of approved PO/WO to winning bidders (see figure              7.6). The supplier delivers the items and the designated inspectors check the items              according to specifications indicated in the RIV. As soon as all the required signatures and              supporting documents are complied with, disbursement voucher is them prepared by the              Supply Office and forwarded to the Office of the Internal Audit for auditing purposes.                Audited disbursement vouchers are forwarded to the Accounting Office for obligation and              corresponding accounting entry and eventually released to the cashier's Office for check              preparation.
