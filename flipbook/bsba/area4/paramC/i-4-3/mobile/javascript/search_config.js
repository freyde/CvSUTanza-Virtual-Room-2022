Agnes                 P. Nuestro and Director for Finance Ms. Lolita G. Herrera virtually sat down with him                   for a meeting to discuss the budget allocation for the activities and projects of the                                    Federated Central Student Government (FCSG).

However, she also emphasized that the University can allot budget for                     FCSG activities provided that there is an approved operational plan, Project                     Procurement Management Plan, and Annual Procurement Plan. VP Nuestro                  suggested that Mr. Tagare discuss this matter with the other officers and decide on                 how the funds will be allotted. She also assured Regent Tagare of the support of her                           office for the programs and activities that will benefit the students.                    They also talked about other issues such as the Related Learning Experience of                    Nursing students and conduct of face-to-face classes in the coming semester.

Student Regent-elect Tagare cited that Kabsuhenyos must spend time with their                 family during the Christmas season and provide time to the students to rest from the                activities. The Student Regent also provided that this is an opportunity for students to                                        recover their physical and mental health.                        The entire Federation of Central Student Government is urging the CvSU                 Administration to heed this call for the students to have more time for themselves, for                  their families, and of course, for their deadlines.
