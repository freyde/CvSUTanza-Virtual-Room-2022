Duterte placed Metro Manila under community quarantine for 30 days                starting on March 15 up to April 14, 2020. On March 16, President Duterte placed the entire                Luzon under enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) from March 17 to April 12, 2020 to arrest                the spread of COVID-19.                         In response to these announcements, the Commission on Higher Education (CHED)                released CHED Advisory No. 2 on March 11, 2020 stating, among others, class suspensions                in all levels in Metro Manila as well as suspension of on-the-job trainings (OJTs), internships,                and/or practicum in the National Capital Region (NCR). Further,  in CHED Advisory No. 3                released on the same date, CHED advised all higher education institutions (HEIs) to “evaluate                students on the basis of available indicators as of this time and forego other curricular activities                for the remainder of the semester.”                         Classes in all levels from there on until April 14, 2020 were suspended, including all                other  online  learning  activities,  since  not  all  students  and  faculty  had  reliable  internet                connection at home. Likewise, with the lockdown and quarantine restrictions, access to basic                and other needs became challenging.                         Given the increasing trend in the confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the country despite                the enhanced community quarantine, and with limited capacity for testing of suspected and                probable carriers of the virus, on April 7, 2020, President Duterte ordered the extension of                ECQ in the entire Luzon until April 30, 2020.                         Consequently, CHED released Advisory No. 6 on April 13, 2020. In the said guidelines,                CHED advises HEIs to “exercise their judgment in the deployment of available flexible learning                and other alternative modes of delivery in lieu of in-campus learning if they have the resources                to  do  so.  The  exercise  of  discretion  by  the  HEIs  and  their  faculty  must  be  reasonable,                transparent and outcomes-based validated.” Further, “HEIs that are using the new academic                calendar are authorized to extend their semester for a maximum of one (1) month after the                lifting of the ECQ.”                         The implementation of the enhanced community quarantine in the country revealed a                number of concerns and challenges both faculty and students had to grapple with. Among                these were inadequate access to basic needs given that some family members lost their jobs                amidst this pandemic on top of travel restrictions; minimal, limited, or totally no access to a                reliable internet connection to participate in online classes or activities; the need to take care                of family members and help them cope with this crisis; and the physical and psychological                effects of being asked to stay at home, to practice physical/social distancing, and to make sure                that none in the family contracts the dreaded disease.                         Despite the anticipated lifting of ECQ on May 1, 2020, the scenario still looks uncertain                and risky for everyone. No one knows who is carrying the virus or not because of the current                limitations on mass testing. In addition, both faculty and students alike were reported to feel                anxious and stressed because of the uncertainties caused by this pandemic.                   *Approved per Academic Affairs Heads’ Resolution No. 10, Series of 2020 dated April 18,                2020","3                      2.  Graduating students are given a one-month extension (after the lifting of the ECQ) to                        submit graduation requirements like theses, dissertations, design projects,  EDP/OJT/                        narrative reports, case studies, student teaching portfolios, capstone / special research                        projects/problems,  and  RLE  requirements.  They  are  required  to  submit  detailed                        accomplishment  reports  along  with  their  duly  approved  proposals/outlines  (if                        applicable)  either  in  soft  or  hard  copies,  whichever  is  most  feasible  for  them.                        Evaluators/ advisory committees are encouraged to be understanding of students who                        were not able to complete these projects due to ECQ.                     3.  Graduating students who need to comply existing deficiencies are also given a one-                        month  extension  (after  the  lifting  of  the  ECQ)  to  settle  these  deficiencies.  Faculty                        members must come up with alternative modes or other possible means for graduating                        students to fulfill these requirements. Faculty members shall submit to their respective                        College / Campus Registrars the list of students and their corresponding completion                        grades.
