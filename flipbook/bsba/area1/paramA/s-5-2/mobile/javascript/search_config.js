This study was conducted to determine the online shopping personality types                         and consumers' buying behavior in Cavite. Specifically, the study aimed to determine                          the demographic profiles of the participants; describe the online shopping personality                         type of consumers; identify the type of buying behavior of online shoppers; determine                         if there is a significant difference between their personality type and buying behavior                         when grouped according to their demographic characteristics.                                The study followed a descriptive design. It was used to describe the online                          shopping personality types of consumers. It was also used to identify online shoppers'                         buying  behavior  and  determine  if  there  is  a  significant  difference  between  their                         personality type and buying behavior when grouped according to their demographic                         characteristics. Furthermore, the researchers used quota sampling to determine the                         number of participants.                                The  data  were  gathered  using  self-administered  survey  questionnaires  that                         were distributed to 200 online shoppers in Cavite.                                     The researchers gathered data from September to December 2021. As a result,                         most  of  the  participants  belonged  to the  age  bracket  of  25-40  years  old  and  were                         female. Also, most of them are employed and have a monthly income ranging from                         10,000 and below.                                Furthermore, researchers gathered data that online shopping personality types                          are  shopping  lovers  and  fun-seekers,  and  consumers'  buying  behavior  is  complex                         buying behavior, dissonance-reducing behavior, and habitual buying behavior. Based                         on the result, there is a significant difference between online shopping personality type,                                                                  xii","which is business users, in terms of age, sex, and monthly income. Meanwhile, there                         is a significant difference between buying behavior in age and employment status. The                         null  hypothesis  formulated  for  this  research  study  was  no  significant  difference                         between their personality types and buying behavior when grouped according to their                          demographic profile. The null hypothesis was rejected.                                Most of the participants belonged to the age bracket of 25-40 years old and                         were female, and most of them were employed and had monthly incomes ranging from                         10,000 and below. The personality types of consumers were fun-seekers, and the type                         of buying behavior of online shoppers was complex buying behavior. Meanwhile, in                          the  significant  difference  between  personality  types  and  buying  behavior  when                         grouped according to their demographic profile, it is shown that age, sex, employment                         status, and monthly income have a significant difference in business users, fearful                         personality  types  and  buying  behavior  have  a  significant  age  difference,  and                         employment status in variety-seeking buying behavior.                                E-retailers  can  use  the  findings  of  this  study  to  allocate  their  marketing                         resources  better  and  create  a  more  successful  marketing  mix  for  each  of  their                          products. Future researchers will use the study as another reference or source if they                         have the  same study  or  are  likely about the  online  shoppers'  personality type  and                         buying behavior. Marketers can collect ideas about the typologies of online shoppers                         and their buying behavior. Also, this study would help the psychologist to understand                         customers' behavior with a high degree of reliability.                                                                                xiii","ABSTRACT                           DE CLARO, ELLEN GRACE P., MEQUIABAS, CARL CHRISTIAN T., NAVA, JEIZEL                        D.,  \&  QUINTANA,  DAVE  JHON  P.

Specifically, the                         study  aimed  to:  determine  the  business  profile  of  the  participants;  determine  the                         perceived effect of community quarantine on the business operational performance of                         micro, small and medium enterprises; determine the perceived effect of community                         quarantine  on  the  business  financial  performance  of  micro,  small  and  medium                          enterprises;  and  determine  if  there  is  a  significant  difference  of  the  business                         performance  of  selected  micro,  small  and  medium  enterprises  when  grouped                         according to profile.                                The descriptive design was used to describe the business profile, the effects of                         community  quarantine  on  the  business  performance  of  selected  micro,  small  and                         medium  enterprises,  and  the  significant  difference  in  the  business  performance  of                          selected micro, small and medium enterprises when grouped according to profile.                                The data were gathered from the responses of 31 participants in Tanza, Cavite                         from  September  2021  to  January  2022.  Furthermore,  the  researchers  used                         convenience sampling in selecting the participants.                                As a result, most of the micro, small and medium enterprise in Tanza, Cavite                         were in the service form of business which is a sole proprietorship type of business                         organization  and  operating  between  one  to  two  years  and  was  classified  as  a                          microenterprise.  It  was  determined  that  the  participants  strongly  agree  that  the                         community quarantine has an effect on customer focus and management support on                                                                   xii","the operations of the business while they agree on supplier management. In terms of                         profitability and liquidity, it was revealed that they maintain the financial performance                         of the business. Thus, they agree that it has no effect on their financial performance.                         There is a significant difference in terms of supplier management and liquidity in terms                          of the nature of the business but there is no significant difference in terms of the type                         of business organization, years of operation, and classification of enterprise on factors                         such as operational and financial performance.                                The  researchers  concluded  that  some  of  the  participants  engaged  in  the                         services business, the majority are sole proprietors, have 1-2 years of operation and                          the majority are microenterprises. Customer focus and management support of the                         businesses were changed under community quarantine. Their business implemented                         new  policies  and  safety  protocols,  and  they  improved  their  relationship  with  their                         suppliers.  They  also  maintained  their  business  liquidity  and  profitability. There  is  a                         significant difference in supplier management and liquidity in terms of the nature of the                         business but no significant difference in the type of business organization, years of                         operation, and classification of an enterprise.                                 The researchers recommend that more variables can be employed in future                         studies to measure the business performance of the MSMEs. Future studies can widen                         the scope of the sample to get more information on the effects of community quarantine                         to the business performance in Cavite.
