                III. BEST PRACTICES

                    ➢      Faculty members regularly update syllabi using the Outcomes-Based
                           Education format of the university.  And just recently, the syllabi were
                           revised  in  response  to  flexible  learning  arrangements  due  to  the
                           pandemic.


                    ➢      Different teaching strategies are used to facilitate and enrich student
                           learning.

                    ➢      All  subjects  with  laboratories  are  required  to  conduct  skills
                           demonstrations to enhance students’ performance.


                    ➢      Peer teaching is encouraged to develop students’ independence

                    ➢      Company interviews are encouraged so that the students can acquire
                           deeper knowledge of the activities they need to perform.
