COVID-19 stands for “coronavirus disease” that started in year 2019. This gave a huge impact not                 only to our country but all over the world. This crisis strikes so much on the first 4 months of the                 year  2020,  during  those  four  months,  people  around  the  world  especially  in  the  Philippines,                experience a very big problem because on those times, the country was under the system called                 ECQ that stands for “Enhanced Community Quarantine”. People were not able to go to work,                students were not allowed to go to school or even outside their houses. The non-food businesses                 were forcedly closed. There were also companies that filed for bankruptcy because they were not                 able to sustain or maintain the expenses and loses of their companies.                         These situations have a huge impact especially in our economy. One of the examples here                 is how our country handled the current crisis. We all know that the budget of our country is not                sufficient  enough  to  provide  all  the  necessary  health  supplies  for  the  COVID  patients  of  the                 country. Especially when COVID strikes someone who is unemployed because of the crisis. Also                 because of this  crisis,  our country is  even in  debts  with the other country.  I can say that our                country’s economy is not stable as of today. We cannot say what will happen to our country if this                 pandemic took so long. Will our country survive in the future? Will our country’s economy survive                in the future? Will our country regain its economic status that we had before? Maybe it’s time for                 us to be the start of a new future.                         Based on data our economy goes down by 7.3%. In our observations in our places some                 business closed their shops for good but some waited for the right time to manage their businesses.                 The impact is most of the businesses are closed so it's a loss some stayed, some grabbed the                opportunity to take over the pandemic. But above all the economy of the Philippines goes down.","References                      https://www.adb.org/news/philippine-economy-decline-further-2020-amid-covid-19-recovery-                 2021#:~:text=MANILA%2C%20PHILIPPINES%20(15%20September%202020,Bank%20(ADB)%20released                                                          %20today.                    https://www.statista.com/statistics/1103540/philippines-economic-impact-coronavirus-covid-19                                   https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41885-020-00078-9/                                    https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41885-020-00078-9                                                             MEMBERS:                                                        ANDAYA KIMBERLY                                                        ORBITA CELJOY                                                    TOLENTION RAFAEL JOSEPH                                                       GALLARDO WILMAR                                                       PRESTON FLORIMAE","Group – 6                  Members:  -Labay, Aira A.                   – Francisco, Lica C.                  -Visitacion, Alaiza                                    -Butel, Dwynette                 - Quijano, Gain                         -Cabique, Jolina                     “THE IMPACT OF COVID – 19 PANDEMIC IN THE ECONOMY OF THE PHILIPPINES IN                                                          YEAR 2020”                        According to (Sara Awad and Alexandra Konn), The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on                the Philippines is severe – already consumption, a major economic growth driver, is significantly                 reduced and visible impacts can be seen in the tourism sector, trade, and remittances. The socio-                economic  impacts  are  estimated  to  reduce  national  GDP  in  2020  by  three  to  four  percentage                 points.  While  the  whole  economy  will  likely  be  affected  to  some  degree,  inequalities  will                 potentially be deepened for the most vulnerable groups: women-headed households, the poor,                ethnic  minorities,  informal  workers,  displaced  persons,  and  those  who  live  in  post-conflict                 regions.  Additionally,  regions  affected  by  natural  disasters  will  be  more  susceptible  to  the                negative  economic  impacts  of  the  pandemic.  In  a  COVID-19  Pulse  Survey  commissioned  by                 Zero Extreme Poverty Philippines 2030 (ZEP PH 2030) and the United Nations Development                Programme  (UNDP),  data  was  collected  via  messenger  chat  box  on  the  experiences  of                 households. Of the survey respondents, around 75% were female, 70% were living below the                 poverty line, and another 25% were on the margin and at risk of falling into poverty. The chat                box survey tool effectively reached the poor who were able to access it with free mobile data.                 The  survey  revealed  that  the  pandemic  had  increased  the  number  of  households  in  income                 poverty  –  with  83%  of  respondents  experiencing  a  decline  in  household  income  and  34%                reporting a complete loss of income. According to the survey results, informal workers, those                 who  rely  on  unreliable  income  sources,  suffered  the  worst:  42%  of  informal  or  temporary                workers lost their source of income compared to 35% of permanent job holders. According to the                 UNDP  and  ZEP,  the  data  gathered  by  the  survey  confirms  the  fears  of  many  actors  in  the                development sphere: that recent progress made in reducing income poverty is being reversed in a","very short span of time. According to CESO’s Country Representative in the Philippines, the                 country has fallen into a deep recession as more than 3000 businesses closed and more than 100                000 families were left without work as a result of the economic impacts of COVID-19. While the                 government has a program to support these families, it is often not enough for those who lost                their income in the long-term. After the lockdown was lifted on May 31, some individuals were                 allowed to return to work but not everyone. Public Utility Vehicle (PUV) drivers for example,                 were without work for many months until June, when only a handful were allowed to resume                driving their vehicles. A particularly vulnerable group is the Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs)                 who previously. contributed billions of dollars in remittances to the Philippines annually. As a                result of COVID-19, approximately 85 000 of OFWs returned to the Philippines, and another                 300  000  had  lost  their  job.  Along  with  OFWs,  MSMEs  have  been  negatively  impacted,                 particularly those in the manufacturing and retailing subsectors. Representing more than 99% of                all  businesses  in  the  Philippines,  MSMEs  employ  about  70%  of  Filipino  workers.  Of  all  the                 MSMEs  in  the  country,  90%  of  micro-enterprises  with  total  assets  less  than  US$61  800,                according to CESO’s Country Representative in the Philippines. These low savings  make it a                 challenge for MSMEs to stay afloat with reduced operations for an extended period of time and                many  will  be  forced  to  close  if  the  pandemic  is  prolonged  for  two  years,  as  some  experts                 estimate.                   Aside from the research we made, Every one on this group also has their own opinion about this                 pandemic’s impact in our economy. Based on Lica Francisco’s observation the impact of Covid-                19  pandemic  in  the  economy  of  the  Philippines  in  year  of  2020  has  changed  worst  because                 maximum  of  one  million  Filipinos  lost  their  jobs  due  to  the  lockdown  because  of  the                implementing  general  quarantine  by  the  governments,  and  also  the  inflation  of  basic  needs                 because of lack of supply. Based on Aira Labay’s opinion Having a pandemic in our country is                really  a big thing. It changes everything we used to do especially when it comes to socializing                 with other people or even in our  own relatives. No bless,  No kiss, No hugs or even shake hands                 is  a  big  No  No.  The  impact  this  pandemic  bought  us  is  like  a  Nightmare,  Our  economy  are                falling  day  by  day.  Many  debt  from  other  countries,  Government  can't  give  what  people's                 Demand are, Hungry People all over our country and of course the long-term damage to potential                output or productivity growth. I know it's not easy for all  of us but soon,  I believe our country                 will survive, our Economy will survive. Based on Alaiza Visitacion’s opinion The COVID-19","pandemic has  resulted in a dramatic worldwide loss of human life  and poses  an unparalleled                 threat to public health, food systems and the world of work. The pandemic has been affecting the                entire  food  system  and  has  laid  bare  its  fragility.  Border  closures,  trade  restrictions  and                 confinement  measures  have  been  preventing  farmers  from  accessing  markets,  including  for                buying  inputs  and  selling  their  produce,  and  agricultural  workers  from  harvesting  crops,  thus                 disrupting domestic and international food supply chains and reducing access to healthy, safe and                 diverse diets. The pandemic has decimated jobs and placed millions of livelihoods at risk. As                breadwinners lose jobs, fall ill and die, the food security and nutrition of millions of women and                 men  are  under  threat,  with  those  in  low-income  countries,  particularly  the  most  marginalized                populations,  which  include  small-scale  farmers  and  indigenous  peoples,  being  hardest  hit.  In                 addition, According to Gain Quijano’s opinion some workers in the company were removed due                 to  lack of money,  some companies  have no sales  as  well because of the pandemic.  In Jolina                Cabique’s  opinion  A  lot  of  companies  here  in  the  Philippines  ,  was  closed  because  of  the                 spreading virus Covid-19. The raw materials uses for their product increases and most of it has                exceed  from  their    budget  so  they  had  no  choice  but  to  close  the  company  and  Increasing                 state/countries  debt.  According  to  Dwynette  Butel,  Philippines  witnessed  a  slower  economic                growth  in  the  first  half  of  2019,  compared  to  2018.  The  country  saw  a  sustained  economic                 growth of 6.3% between 2010 and 2018, while the growth slowed down to 5.5% in H2 2019.                 The World Bank estimates Philippines to witness full-year 2019 economic growth of 5.8%.The                ongoing coronavirus impact is expected to result in a subdued growth for the economy in 2020.                  As we read each other’s opinion toward the topic, We noticed that most of our opinions are just                 the same or either similar to each other, This Pandemic changes everything. There is this “New                Normal” that happens. Our economy may not be stable right now but were hoping for the healing                 and changes in the near future.","","","","","","Republic of the Philippines                                                CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY                                                         Tanza Campus                                              COLLEGE OF BUSINESS MANAGEMENT                                                      “ALFAMART OUTLET OBSERVATION”                                               In Partial Fulfilment of the Requirements in                                                           MKTG75                                                  Second Semester 2020-2021                                                            Submitted by:                                                           Garcia, Erika D.

Shopping Public                         When your pantry needs to be restocked, you go the grocery, which is pretty much like a                trip to the mall, you dress up, drive or commute, wait in the long cashier lines to pay then head               home. And then there are times when you run out of ulam, shampoo, or any other  product at an                opportune time and just need to do a quick run to the nearest convenience store. No need to dress up               and  it’s  most likely within walking distance, but the variety  is pretty  limited, and the prices are                higher because it’s “convenience”. For each shopping situation, you always rely on a different go to               grocery or convenience store. But what if you can rely on just one store?
