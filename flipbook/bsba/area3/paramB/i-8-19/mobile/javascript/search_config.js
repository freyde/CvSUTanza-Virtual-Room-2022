Most of the costs of the                vacation (airfare, hotel, and foregone wages) are measured in thousands of pesos, but                the benefits of the vacation are peace of mind. How can you make a decision to take a                vacation for a psychological in spite of the costs? (10 points)                                                                             8 points                         Humans are vulnerable because we all feel exhausted, tired, stress, drain in our                life that is why we need a vacation even once in a while to let out all the stress, worries,                problems that we’ve carrying to have a peace of mind and get up to see another day,                but going on a vacation is expensive because of the airfare, hotel and foregone wages                that are measured in thousands of pesos.

When the cold snaps Brgy. Cosmi, the price of the lemon rises in the market.                            •  Law of Demand – since the cold snaps happen the harvest in lemons has                               been affected. In that, the price also affected, and it rises, if the price of                               lemon rises in the market because of cold snap, the demand for the lemon                               will fall or decrease because some buyer or consumer cannot afford                               lemon with the higher price.                           •  Law of Supply – since the cold snaps happen the harvest in lemons has                               been affected. In that, the price also affected, and it rises, if the price of                               lemon rises in the market because of cold snap, the supply for the lemon  10 points                               will also increase because the product is profitable for the seller, so they                               tend to supply more                     b.  During MassKara Festival in Bacolod, the price of hotel rooms rises.                            •  Law of Demand – During MassKarra Festival in Bacolod there are a lot                               people came and need a place to stay in, the price of the hotel room has                               been affected by it, and it rises. If the price hotel of room rises the demand                               will fall because some people cannot afford it.                           •  Law of Supply - During MassKarra Festival in Bacolod there are a lot                               people came and need a place to stay in, the price of the hotel room has                               been affected by it, and it rises.
