The webinar served as a                 platform to train the participants on the new normal of online business in terms of setting-                  up, starting and selling.                         During  the  webinar  about  setting-up  an  online  business,  Ms.  Mary  Joy  Olazo,                 online business owner and  a marketing specialist, shared some guides on how to set-up                  an online store. According to her, the first step is to start with a really great idea by having                 a business or product idea that potential customers will be interested in, and confirmed it                  with market research. They need to be creative and do a little bit of online market research                 to find a suitable product for the online store. The next thing to do is to create an ideal                  business  name.  It  is  time  to determine  how  the  business  will appear to  the  world  by","settling on a name for the online business. The name is the biggest decision to make as                 they need to work on their brand, and it’s likely the most important decision since it will                  set the foundation of their business and other decisions to make.  She also mentioned                 that  the  most  important  part  of  setting-up  a  business  is  to  do  a  business  plan.  The                  business plan includes an analysis of the competition and a clear positioning statement                 of where they business fit within the market. It should also include information on  the                  target audience, which the market research should have given them a nice head start on                 collecting.                          The next resource speaker is Mr. John Daniel Olazo. His talk focused on how to                 start an online business in the new normal. The highlight of his talk focused on choosing                  and building the online platform for the business. For an online business, that platform is                 everything. They need it to look good, be intuitive to navigate, and make a clear case to                 visitors why they should buy. Take time to get it right, and run the finished product by                  some  other  people  (ideally  people  in  their  target  audience)  to  get  feedback.  He  also                 shared that before they launch their business, they should establish a marketing plan.                  Every business is different and marketing isn’t one size fits all. Because they are starting                 an online business, they need to make use of a mix of content marketing, social media                  promotion, and paid search promotion. These will boost their online market presence.                         The last resource speaker is Mr. Arnel Arnaiz Pioz, a marketing strategist, focused                  his discussion on no cost marketing which is the best tool to market products online. He                 emphasized on his talk that a marketing plan that does not require any costs or expenses                  to be made is called no-cost marketing. This technique is very popular among  online                 businesses. No-cost marketing typically involves curating zero or negligible marketing","techniques that can promote your products and create brand awareness. According to                 him, the internet is one of the biggest mediums of this type of marketing strategy.  This                  involves the use of social media which has a plethora of free resources and options that                 can boost your business sales. It is one of the easiest and cost-efficient methods to start                  the marketing journey. One of the biggest advantages of social media platforms is the                 level of engagement and awareness that they can create. Brands can easily build their                  personality  over  social  media  and  target  their  potential  customers.  Mr.  Pios  also                 suggested budget-friendly ads on apps like Facebook, Instagram, and Tiktok that can be                  customized according to their target audience.

This can also be called product distribution. As businesses become                 more  global  it  becomes  important  to  improve  distribution  to  ensure  that  customers  and  all                  members  of  the distribution  channel are  happy.  Depending  on  the  length  of  the  distribution                 channel there can be many people involved in distribution.                         There's  a  great  deal  of  commotion  going  after  consideration.  To  slice  through  the                 commotion  and  to  have  any  resonance  with  ability  user,  a  product  needs  to  get  known  and                 esteemed  by  users.  A  product  having  powerful  and  compelling  distribution  accomplishes  the                  required perceivability and worth.  Goods and services are sometimes delivered to customers                 through a combination of short and long channels. Expanding the quantity of ways, a purchaser                 can track down a decent can build deals. However, it can likewise make an intricate framework                 that occasionally makes distribution management troublesome. Longer distribution routes might                 also result in a lower profit margin for each intermediary.                 Objectives of the Seminar                         Generally, this webinar aims to help, student, business owner, and young entrepreneurs                  to have an idea on how to properly distribute the product in the new normal.                         Specifically, it aims to:                               a.  Understanding product distribution flow;                               b.  Basic knowledge on how the manufacturer manage distributor;                               c.  Knowing and understanding the customers need in the new normal trends.                 Date and Venue                         The webinar was conducted at Cavite State University-Tanza Campus via Cisco Webex                 and Facebook Live on June 14, 2021, (Monday) from 1:00 pm to 2:30 pm.                                                                  1","Resource Speakers                         The webinar was conducted by BS in Business Management of Cavite State University-                Tanza Campus.                                                    Ms. Doneza Torrefranca is a Graduate of AB Communication Arts in University of the East-                 Manila. She’s currently working as Indirect Procurement - Sr Buyer American Power Conversion                 by Schneider Electric. The Scope of her work are handling the procurement of products and                 services  for  manufacturing.  Such  as  machines,  spare  parts,  repairs,  building  construction  \&                  renovation, Office and admin supplies, Logistics, warehousing and building rentals. She also had                 an experience working at Wu Kong S Pte Ltd and Industrial Galvanizers Corporation.                 Learning Experience                         I learned in Ms. Doneza talk  is how really the product distribution works. And I find it                 interesting because we already know the distribution model. Apparently, Ms. Doneza give us a                 real  example  of  the  distribution  and  it’s  kind  of  difficult  to  conduct  the  product  distribution  in                 business.  She also feed us on how the manufacturer manage the distributor, how the distributor                  partner functions and how they market the product. In her last topic the customers need, the                                                                   2","manufacturers should know what customers need now because in every year there is a change                 and happenings that cannot control and they need to forecast that in order to survive the business                 and successfully distribute the products and services.                 Strength and Weaknesses of the Webinar                          The Product Distribution in the New Normal that was held at Cavite State University-Tanza                 Campus via Cisco Webex and Facebook Live encounter some flaws and strengths during the                 meeting. The problem that I encountered was a little bit delayed start of the event and audio                 problem. The starting time of the event was 1:00 pm but the event was started at 1:20 pm, and                 because of the Facebook live has gone at the time where the webinar was starting at 1pm and                  get on track at 1:19pm so technically the webinar delayed by 20 mins. And also, some technical                 issues like the audio and slow internet connection, some of the video played by speaker cannot                 hear clearly.                         The  strength  of  the  webinar  was  a  free  registration  webinar  with  an  e-certificate. The                 speaker has a smooth discussion though for me, her videos played can’t hear clearly it was in a                 low volume. The meeting room is very quiet no noises can be heard. The topic is very informative                 and explained clearly. She also shared her experience in her company as an example to the topic.                  Over-all Evaluation of the Webinar                         Product Distribution in the New Normal was conducted by BS in Business Management                 students and as one of the committees I must say that its very difficult to conduct a webinar. My                 overall  evaluation  for  this  webinar  was  good,  the  lacking  problem  before  the  webinar  was                 recognize and found the solution before its discussion though the webinar was delayed it still a                  successful webinar.                 Recommendation/s                         I recommend in the webinar carefully handle the technical problems and make the webinar                 more creative graphics. Manage the display content properly and be attentive.                                                                   3","Certificate                                                                                                                                     4","Photo Documentation                                                                                                            Registration Form                                                                                       5","The speaker, Ms. Doneza Torrefranca.","Discussion of product distribution in the new normal by the speaker.                                                                                              6","Evaluation form was given to the participants right after the webinar ends.                                                                                            7","The participants after the discussion","References                  AWH, (2020).
