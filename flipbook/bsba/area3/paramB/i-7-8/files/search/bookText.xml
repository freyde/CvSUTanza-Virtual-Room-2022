                              The  tree  of  life,  or  coconut,  is  a  well-known  plant  in  the  world  that  provides

                       numerous benefits to humans and is grown in tropical regions such as the Philippines,

                       one  of  the  world's  largest  coconut  producers.  Coconut  provides  disease-fighting

                       antioxidants,  promotes  blood  sugar  regulation,  lowers  certain  risk  factors  for  heart

                       disease, and can also help with weight loss.


                              Filcoco  Delight  was  created  by  combining  the words  "Filipino"  (a citizen  of the

                       Philippines, where the product originated) and "Coconut" as the product's main ingredient.

                       The word "delight" was used because Filcoco Delight brings happiness to someone who’ll

                       eat it. Dried young coconut is an organic Filipino snack that’s rich in fiber and originated

                       in Cebu City, Philippines. Organic food has become the primary sustainable alternative to

                       conventional  food  consumption  in  recent  decades,  which  has  caused  an  increase  in

                       demand  for  organic  food,  where  healthiness  has  been  cited  as  the  key  motivator  for


                       purchasing organic products among the many organic food features.

                              Filcoco  Delight  will  be  based  in  Denmark,  a  country  in  Europe.  Since  Filcoco

                       Delight is a portion of organic food, the company chose a country that highly consumes

                       organic foods like the dried young coconuts of the Philippines. Denmark is one of the top

                       countries that consumed organic food worldwide. According to Statista (2022), Denmark


                       and Switzerland had the highest per capita consumption of organic food of any country in

                       the world in 2020. That year, the average Swiss and Danish consumer purchased around

                       418 and 384 euros of organic food, respectively.

                              Filcoco Delight is not just the usual plain, dried young coconut. In Filcoco Delight,

                       the dried young coconut will be thinly sliced (strip) and dipped in chocolate. Filcoco Delight

                       I. Economic Background

                              Denmark  is  the  smallest,  flattest,  and  most  continental  of  the  Scandinavian


                       countries. Although Denmark is a small country, Denmark maintains a high standard of

                       living  where  its  per  capita  GDP  is  among  the  highest  in  the  world—as  well  as  well-

                       developed  social  services.  The  economy  is  mostly  centered  on  service  sectors,

                       commerce, and manufacturing; agriculture and fishing employ just a small percentage of

                       the population. Small businesses are the most common.


                                     On  March  30,  1946,  Denmark  joined  the  International  Bank  for

                       Reconstruction and Development or the World Bank. It was one of the first countries to

                       receive a loan to help in the reconstruction of its economy following World War II. Denmark

                       is now one of the five institutions that comprise the World Bank Group. Denmark and the

                       World Bank collaborate with other member countries to finance projects, develop policies,

                       and implement programs aimed at eradicating poverty in the developing world. With a

                       contemporary economy that is well integrated into the global marketplace, Denmark also


                       joined the European Union in 1973, and NATO, at the same time as the United Kingdom,

                       was the country's most important trading partner. Denmark and the other Nordic region,

                       even  those  that  have  not  yet  joined  the  EU,  have  had  a  long-standing  economic

                       partnership that continues today.

                                     The Danish public is in support of continuing to restrict immigration policy


                       with  an  emphasis  on  integration,  as  implemented  by  successive  governments.  The

                       government has set high greenhouse gas targets and is looking at new CO2 tariffs. The

                       economy  is  strongly  reliant  on  international  trade,  and  the  private  sector  comprises

                       numerous  small  and  medium-sized  businesses  that  compete  with  global  leaders  in

                                     Denmark is distinguished by strong government assistance programs and

                       equitable income distribution. Private sector expenditures make for more than half of net


                       national revenue in Denmark's mixed welfare-state economy. Health and social services,

                       education, economic affairs, foreign affairs, and national defense are the top priorities for

                       public expenditure. The government does not earn a lot of money through commercial or

                       industrial activities.

                              This analysis is used to assess external factors that may have an  impact on a

                       company's profitability upon entering Denmark.


                              A.  Political


                              Denmark's  administration  and  management  structure  includes  both  a

                       constitutional monarchy and a unitary parliamentary system. The king is the head of the

                       state,  while  the  prime  minister  is  the  head  of  the  government.  Since  Denmark  is  a

                       constitutional  monarchy  with  a  parliamentary  system  that  is  representational  and

                       democratic.  As  with  practically  all  constitutional  monarchy,  the  monarch  of  Denmark

                       performs largely ceremonial tasks even if he or she retains executive power. The monarch

                       does not support any political party; however, he does execute some important official


                       functions, like as signing laws and appointing and dismissing the Prime Minister. For a

                       long time, Denmark has been a member of the European Union and the North Atlantic

                       Treaty  Organization  and  this  membership  and  alliances  played  a  significant  impact  in

                       influencing Denmark's economy.

                       rate is 22%. Value-added and inheritance taxes are two other types of taxes. The total tax

                       burden  is  equal  to  46.3  percent  of  total  domestic  income.  Over  the  last  three  years,

                       government spending has amounted to 51.3 percent of total output (GDP), with budget


                       surpluses averaging 0.3 percent of GDP. The national debt is equal to 43.4 percent of

                       GDP. Denmark has 46 preferential trade agreements in force as a member of the EU.

                       With 640 EU-mandated nontariff measures in place, the trade-weighted average tariff rate

                       (shared across EU countries) is 2.9 percent. Denmark has a total of 26 nontariff barriers

                       that are particular to the country. Large flows of investment are facilitated by open-market


                       rules that maintain competitiveness. The financial sector is well-established and stable.


                               Businesses in Denmark live in peace and freedom than other countries because

                       of the country’s equality and the country’s stable democracy traditionally  with minority

                       governments.  Denmark  has  no  major  business  or  human  rights  issues.  The  Danish

                       Institute for Human Rights is their own national human rights institution, and they have


                       signed  several  international  human  rights  conventions  and  supported  United  Nations

                       activities  against torture  and for the rights  of  people  with  disabilities.  The government

                       ensures businesses, like how they ensure people in the country from any terrorist attack,

                       also the country has a low crime and lack of corruption.


                              B.  Economic and Currency


                              Denmark's economy is diversified, with a focus on service industries, commerce,

                       and  manufacturing.  Agriculture,  tourism,  energy,  and  transportation  are  the  most

                       prominent industries. Denmark's main exports include packaged medicaments, refined

                       petroleum, beef, electrical items, and cheese, which are generally shipped to Germany,

                       Sweden, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Norway. Denmark is a member of


                       the European Union but not of the Eurozone. Despite having previously met the criteria

                                                                                                           10]]></page><page Index="36"><![CDATA[for membership in the European Economic and Monetary Union, Denmark has negotiated

                       an  opt-out  with  the  EU  and  is  not  forced  to  adopt  the  euro  and  keep  on  their  official

                       currency which is Krone. Denmark is having modest economic growth. Unemployment

                       stood at 5.7% in 2022 while inflation (CPI) is 0.3%, according to the heritage foundation.


                       In terms of hiring and firing, the labor market was accommodating. While firms are having

                       problems  obtaining  adequately  skilled  personnel  to  fill  billets,  the  Danish  government

                       offers substantial initiatives to teach unemployed people to work in industries that require

                       qualified workers. Denmark is very welcome in business no matter how small or big it is

                       and they even encourage businesses to build up business there not just to create income


                       but to also decrease unemployment. Employees there in Denmark are also supported by

                       the government to enhance their skills, so businesses may not worry about who should

                       be hire. People in Denmark used their own currency (Krone) in purchasing so businesses

                       must also use the krone.

                              C.  Social and Cultural Factors

                              Danish society is commonly described as having qualities such as openness, trust,

                       and a lack of corruption. Denmark has democratic traditions, a strong educational system


                       where  education  is  free,  and  an  open  tax  system  that  speak  volumes.  However,  the

                       emergence  of  right-wing  groups,  the  aging  population,  the  high  cost  of  real  estate,

                       inequality, and the integration of migrants and ethnic minorities into the labor market are

                       some of the major issues confronting the society of Denmark today. Danish is the official

                       language of Denmark while English is their particular second language, and Christianity


                       is the most widely practiced religion. Danes’ customers are the world's most pro-organic

                       consumers.  Denmark,  in  reality,  has  the  greatest  organic  market  share  and  the  most

                       developed organic market in the world. Danes are often referred to as cozy, calm, and

                       relaxed. When a business employs Danish workers, the owner must get to use on how

                       Danish communicates, they usually do not address the manager or CEO in “sir or boss”

                                                                                                           11]]></page><page Index="37"><![CDATA[they just practically called a co-worker by its first name, and also, they talk to them casually

                       according to them, it is way better if it can be translated into Danish so it is better for a


                       business to also hire a Danish. It also an advantage to a business if it offers organic

                       products because most of the Danish people are looking on it.

                              D.  Technological Factors and Infrastructure

                              Without  a  doubt,  modern  infrastructure  has  played  a  significant  role  in

                       technological advancement. Denmark is unquestionably one of the most technologically


                       advanced  countries  in  the  world.  According  to  recent  research,  Denmark  is  the  most

                       technologically sophisticated country in Europe. Most Danes own smart gadgets and have

                       social  media  accounts.  The  Internet  service  is  quite  dependable  and  widely  available

                       throughout  the  country,  and  approximately  92  percent  of  people  use  it.  In  Denmark,

                       Facebook is the most popular social networking platform. Instagram and LinkedIn are two

                       other popular social networking services. The use of YouTube is also excellent and there

                       also  some  of  the  most  popular  online  stores  were  visited  like  Amazon,  Just-eat,


                       Zalando.dk, etc. In this era of science and technology, Danish Research and Development

                       Department  helps  its  economy  to  profit  from  the  most  recent  developments  and

                       enhancements. However, Denmark is experiencing a labor shortage in the ICT sector. As

                       a result, the government has taken steps to boost the technology, science, mathematics,

                       and  IT  graduates  in  the  country.  Since  Denmark  is  also  advanced  in  technology,


                       businesses  can  easily  transact  online  and  be  able  to  create  an  online  business.

                       Businesses will also be able to make online marketing by having social media accounts

                       to post its product or services.

                                                                                                           12]]></page><page Index="38"><![CDATA[Denmark supports entrepreneurship and innovation. Working hours, leave, holiday

                       of the areas where Danish law protects employees and workers. Business regulations are

                       well-defined and simple to comprehend. In Denmark, the entrepreneurial spirit is alive and


                       well. Collective bargaining is used to determine wages and working conditions, and union

                       members make up 75% of the workforce. Higher subsidies to enable a big growth in the

                       according  to  a  government  commission.  However,  before  starting  self-employment  or

                       forming  a  business,  individuals  or  businesses  from  outside  the  Nordic  nations,  the


                       EU/EEA, and Switzerland must apply for a residence and work permit. Intellectual property

                       rights are recognized, and they are enforced following international standards. Property

                       rights are well-protected by law and strongly enforced, and a reliable, independent, and

                       impartial judicial system is embedded throughout the economy. Businesses who would

                       like  to  enter  in  Denmark  must  be  registered  for  legalization  of  business  and  to  be

                       protected. In terms of employment, Danish can freely work on the business in the country

                       but  people  outside  the  country  must  get  a  permit.  So,  when  a  company  appoints  an


                       employee outside Denmark it must apply for a residence and work permit.

                       III. Economic Factors

                          A.  Size of Market

                              In 2022, It is estimated that the current population of Denmark is 5.8 million people

                       with a 2.8 million male population and 2.9 million female population. This is an increase of


                       0.42 percent compared to the population the year before. Women in the country appear

                       to be living longer than males, with an average life expectancy of 81 years vs 77 years for

                       men (UNSD 2022). 65.3 percent of Denmark’s population ranged age between 15 and 64

                       years old, 17.6 percent of the population are under 15 while the remaining 17.1 percent of

                       the population belong to 65 years old and above. As of March 2022, Denmark's population

                                                                                                           13]]></page><page Index="39"><![CDATA[density is 135.3 people per square kilometer (350.5/mi2) according to UNSD. Determining

                       the population of the market helps the business to calculate its target market. A more

                       population means more demand, but aside from it businesses must also take care of the

                       supply so the increase of population may also cause a shortage. But in Denmark, the


                       growth  of  the  population  is  not  that  much  so  business  is  able  to  catch  up  with  the

                       consumers’ demand.

                          B.  National Income

                              Denmark is based primarily on service industries, trade, and manufacturing; only

                       a tiny percentage of the population is engaged in agriculture and fishing. Denmark's GDP


                       per capita in 2020 was 63,552 US dollars. Denmark's GNI per capita increased from 3,776

                       US dollars in 1971 to 63,552 US dollars in 2020, expanding at a 6.52 percent yearly pace.

                       In 2021, Denmark's GDP climbed from 572246 DKK Million in the third quarter to 584192

                       increased and most of the time stays in high rank than other countries, this means that

                       businesses also increased their profit.

                          C.  Purchasing Power


                              In Denmark, new businesses are encouraged because entrepreneurs find it quite

                       easy to interact with local governments and are encouraged to develop and invest. The

                       number of units of a country's currency required to purchase the same amount of goods

                       and services on the domestic market is known as the purchasing power parity conversion

                       factor.  Denmark's  purchasing  power  parity  was  6.6  LCU  (Local  currency  unit)  per


                       international dollar in 2020. Denmark's purchasing power parity declined over time, from

                       8.7 LCU per international dollar in 2001 to 6.6 LCU per international dollar in 2020. In

                       Denmark business has the right to set prices on its product because they are free-market

                       economy.  Many  Danes  prefer  to  spend  their  money  on  activities  rather  than  buying

                       expensive stuff and are unaffected by expensive automobiles or branded goods. With this,

                                                                                                           14]]></page><page Index="40"><![CDATA[businesses can set prices on their own, but businesses must also be careful about setting

                       prices. Most Danish has high purchasing power and are able to purchase expensive things

                       but Danish spends their money on valuable things.

                          D.  Availability of Credit


                              Danes, like residents of other Nordic countries, prefer cashless transactions such

                       as local and international bank transfers, mobile phone apps, and bank cards. Cheques

                       are becoming increasingly rare, as is the use of cash. Danmarks Nationalbank manages

                       Denmark's  IMF  membership  in  collaboration  with  the  Ministry  of  Finance.  Denmark  is

                       represented  on  the  Board  of  Governors,  the  International  Monetary  and  Financial


                       Committee (IMFC), and the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

                       Denmark works closely with the other Nordic and Baltic nations in appointing an Executive

                       Director to represent Nordic and Baltic interests at the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

                       By the end of 2020, Danmarks Nationalbank has outstanding debts to the IMF of KR 10.2

                       billion.  Denmark  is  also  a  member  of  the  EU  and  World  Bank  which  also  helps  the

                       country’s economy to recover from some issues it encounters. The cash flow in Denmark

                       is stable, institutions trusted the country and have built a strong relationship with them. So


                       when it comes of needs country can easily look for support, for Denmark to support its

                       economy  too.  Businesses  who  wanted  to  enter  Denmark  should  be  also  advanced  in

                       payment  transactions  like  cashless  payment  to  be  able  to  meet  Danish  and  other

                       consumers in the country.

                       IV. Type of Economy


                              Denmark is part of a high-income economy. In 2020, Denmark got 63,552 US

                       dollars. According to Trading Economics global macro models and analysts, by the end of

                       2021, Denmark's GDP per capita is expected to reach 63,500.00 USD. According to our

                       econometric models, Denmark's GDP per capita is expected to rise to roughly 64,200.00

                       USD in 2022. Denmark is considered as one of the best examples of a country committed

                                                                                                           15]]></page><page Index="41"><![CDATA[to the free-enterprise system, which is frequently strengthened by a strong civil society.

                       I. Cultural Background

                          A.  National Culture

                                 a.  Identity

                              Denmark is a small country with regional customs that distinguish rural, urban, and

                       island populations based on cuisine, language, and history. The country's name refers to

                       a  political  unit  that  existed  from  the  sixth  to  ninth  centuries  and  is  known  as  the

                       "Borderlands of the Danes." The Danes, who originated in Skaane, which is now known

                       as the southernmost portion of Sweden, but finally settled in Jutland, saw a slow evolution


                       of sovereignty throughout this time. By the ninth century, the Danes had taken control of

                       the territory that is now recognized as Denmark, and they held it until the late medieval

                       period, including parts of present Sweden and Norway. Denmark was decreased in size

                       in the late medieval period to roughly the size of modern Denmark.


                                 b.  Material Life
                              Denmark manufactures industrial minerals and other goods produced from them


                       and is essentially self-sufficient in fundamental building and construction raw materials.

                       Gravel, sand, and clay are the most common raw materials mined onshore. Denmark's

                       Living Costs by Region The most popular cities, such as Copenhagen, Aarhus, Odense,

                       and Aalborg, are likely to be the most expensive. The service industry employs 80 percent

                       of the workforce, while manufacturing employs 11 percent and agriculture employs 2%. In

                       2020, the nominal gross national income per capita was $58,439, ranking ninth in the


                       world. With a population of 5,822,763 (1 January 2020),[27] Denmark is the world's 36th

                                 c.  Language

                              There is just one official language in Denmark. Danish is the national language of

                       the Danish people, however other minority languages such as Faroese, German, and

                       Greenlandic are also spoken. Faroese, like Danish, is a North Germanic language and the

                       primary language of the Kingdom's self-governing territory of the Faroe Islands. Some

                       Faroese immigrants to mainland Denmark also speak it. Faroese is a language that is

                       similar to Icelandic and Old Norse. A huge majority of Danes, roughly 86 percent, speak


                       English as a second language, which is required of all Danish pupils beginning in third

                       grade in public primary schools. A third language choice, generally German or French, is

                       offered  in  the  first  grade  of  folkeskole.  The  great  majority  choose  German,  with

                       approximately 47 percent of Danes reporting conversational German ability. Swedish is

                       the third most generally understood foreign language, with over 13% of Danes saying that

                       they can speak it.


                                 d.  Social Interactions

                              Trust is an unnoticed resource in Danish society. Because it generates a sense of

                       serenity, which boosts happiness and security, it results in less social problems and crime.

                       With  trust,  many  of  the  bureaucratic  headaches  and  expenditures  associated  with

                       increased security and double-checking may be avoided. Trust can appear in a variety of

                       ways. Most people trust their friends and relatives, but Denmark also has a broad societal


                       trust, or the ability to trust someone you've never met before, according to anthropologists.

                       Unless they demonstrate differently, Danes are thought to be honest and trustworthy. This

                       communal trust extends to Danish institutions including the government, police, courts,

                       and  health  care.  People  in  positions  of  power  are  expected  to  act  in  society's  best

                       interests, and corruption is uncommon. A Danish company can be relied on to deliver a

                                                                                                           18]]></page><page Index="44"><![CDATA[high-quality product on schedule, or to be upfront about why it can't. When welcoming

                                 e.  Aesthetics

                              Denmark has a reputation for excellent architectural design and welfare policies.

                       Functionality,  playfulness,  and  minimalism  are  all  trademarks  of  Danish  design.

                       Denmark's  architecture  may  be  traced  back  to  the  Viking  era,  as  evidenced  by

                       archaeological artifacts. It was solidified throughout the Middle Ages, when Romanesque


                       and subsequently Gothic churches and cathedrals sprung up all over the country. Free

                       and  equal  access  to  benefits  such  as  healthcare  and  education  for  all  citizens  is  a

                       cornerstone of the Danish welfare system, commonly known as the Scandinavian welfare

                       model.

                                 f.  Religion

                              Religious Beliefs. Religious liberty is in accordance with international religious

                       freedom norms. The Evangelical Lutheran Church, which has been funded by the state


                       for centuries and is regarded as the national church, is home to 86 percent of the people.

                       The Catholic Church, the Danish Baptist Church, and the Pentecostal Movement are only

                       a  few  examples  of  various  Christian  groups.  Islam,  Judaism,  Hinduism,  Buddhism,

                       Baha'ism, and Sikhism are among the other world religions represented in the country.

                       Recent years have seen the emergence of religious groups dedicated to ancient Viking


                       gods.

                              Religious Practitioners. The majority religion is Christianity, and at birth all Danes

                       are considered to belong to the national church, with an obligation to pay church taxes as

                       part  of  the  income  tax.  Since  the  fifteenth  century  priests  have  been  educated  in  a

                       university,  and  ministers  in  the  national  church  are  officials  under  the  Minister  of

                                                                                                           19]]></page><page Index="45"><![CDATA[Ecclesiastical Affairs. The official duties of religious leaders include performing church

                       ceremonies for local members of the national church and keeping a register of births,

                       marriages, and deaths. Many religious practitioners participate in worldly affairs as social


                       workers or advocate for the underprivileged in public debate

                              Rituals  and  Holy  Places.  Churches  can  be  found  both  inside  and  outside  of

                       villages, towns, and cities, and are surrounded by churchyards and cemeteries. There is

                       a  servant,  an  organist,  a  minister,  and  a  cantor  in  a  Lutheran  service.  Baptisms,

                       confirmations, wedding ceremonies, and funerals are among the ceremonial occasions

                       that members attend, as are significant religious events like Christmas and Easter. Only


                       a small percentage of individuals consistently attend services, and churches are nearly

                       vacant on weekdays.

                              Death  and  the  Afterlife.  Since  Danes  are  not  particularly  religious,  customs

                       relating to death, the deceased, funerals, and the afterlife are handled in a reasonable and

                       practical  manner.  People  are  either  buried  in  coffins  on  the  grounds  of  a  church  or

                       cremated and their ashes interred in the cemetery. Graves are surrounded by greenery

                       and  flowers  and  have  a  gravestone  with  the  deceased's  name,  dates,  and  greetings.


                       Unless  family  members  pay  for  its  upkeep,  the  grave  is  ignored  after  twenty  years.

                       Religious practitioners are typically available to encourage surviving families and discuss

                       life, death, and the afterlife. People are being escorted to the other side to communicate

                       with deceased family members and relatives in neoreligious societies.

                                 g.  Education


                              In Denmark, education is very important as it is in the schools in the kingdom is

                       where most English speakers learned it from. Children typically enroll in kindergarten at

                       the age of 3. Most kindergartens are more focused on teaching the children social skills,

                       but in the final  3rd year before school starts, many children will receive some pre-school

                       training  based  on  their  readiness.  After  kindergarten,  compulsory  education  begins.

                                                                                                           20]]></page><page Index="46"><![CDATA[Compulsory education for Danish children lasts for ten years. There’s an optional 11th

                       year which is often taken as a gap year on an “efterskole”, an independent boarding school

                       focused on arts, sport, theater, and other dedicated subjects. After the compulsory years,

                       more than 70% of children continue their education in high school, which lasts 2 to 3 years.


                       Most  of  the  rest  opt  for  vocational  education  institutions,  and  very  few  get  no  further

                       education. The first thing that springs to mind when you visit a school in Denmark is the

                       safe  environment.  Children  down  to  the  age  of  8  are  walking  or  biking  to  school  by

                       themselves, there’s no need for excessive security, and teachers and personnel have

                       friendly and informal dialogues with parents and students outside the classrooms. Due to


                       the  high  level  of  equality  in  Danish  society,  everyone  can feel  welcome  in  the  school

                       system and have the same access to education. The high degree of state funding means

                       that Denmark’s education system ranking is consistently high compared to the rest of the

                       world.

                                 h.  Value Systems

                          Danish society has long been known for its high level of trust in one another. This is

                       most likely due to the fact that it is largely a homogeneous nation with similar culture,


                       values, language, and religious system. Trust in one another fosters a civilization of safety,

                       happiness,  and  reliable  connections.  Denmark's  top  most  prevalent  values  include  its

                       Christian heritage, Hygge, one of their cultural values, being unprejudiced and tolerant,

                       and many others.

                          As a statement of Danish culture and perhaps even ideals, one Danish kindergarten


                       is required to offer pork. As a security measure, there is talk of monitoring or censoring

                       what is spoken in mosques. These actions put into question what tolerance and freedom

                       of  expression  imply  in  Denmark.  The  meaning  of  gender  equality  is  crucial  to

                       comprehending human rights, which include the right to religious freedom. The sympathy

                          Danish business culture is distinguished by a strong sense of egalitarianism and a

                       short power barrier between corporate tiers. The owner's door is usually open, and he or

                       she welcomes conversations with employees at all levels. Job titles are rarely used and

                       are considered pompous. In a Danish business meeting, it is acceptable to argue with the

                       boss, even in front of others. Danish business culture is more laid-back than Swedish or

                       German company cultures. In fact, people from those nations may feel dissatisfied by the


                       Danes' laid-back attitude. In Danish business culture, even though a conclusion is reached

                       by consensus, it can be modified the next day if new or superior information becomes

                       available. The openness and trust that characterize Danish corporate culture are critical.

                       If you make a mistake, your Danish business partners will expect you to admit it right away

                       and start working to resolve the issue. Because Danes are known for their tolerance, what

                       is  deemed  unpleasant  behavior  is  usually  anything  that  violates  the  tolerance  norms.

                       Racist jokes, for example, is considered extremely impolite. Modesty is also valued in


                       conversation and behavior. Materialism and demonstrations of individual achievement are

                       disliked  by  the  Danes.  Make  sure  corporate  gatherings  include  social  activities  to

                       demonstrate your gratitude for the Danish passion of hospitality and 'coziness.'

                          Business dress code.

                              The Danes' easygoing attitude is reflected in a loose but nevertheless conventional


                       clothing code. While many executives prefer a suit and tie, it is not uncommon to see them

                       in more casual attire. This is especially true in encounters with contacts they already know.

                       Women also dress informally. High-ranking Danish executives frequently organize black-

                       tie  dinners.  Male  executives  should  then  bring  a  tuxedo.  If  you  anticipate  such  an

                       invitation, women will want an evening gown.

                                                                                                           22]]></page><page Index="48"><![CDATA[Business meeting.

                              Meetings are an important part of Danish business culture because they are the

                       most prevalent technique of keeping people informed. Danes want meetings to be brief

                       and well-structured, with as little paperwork as possible. However, it is still vital for Danes


                       to  follow  a  written  agenda  and  to  have  a  written  summary  of  all  the  most  important

                       agreements and decisions.

                          Business relationship.

                              There are no formal conditions for contract formation. Oral offers, acceptances,

                       and  contracts  are  acceptable,  but  written  contracts  are  preferred.  In  the  event  of  a


                       disagreement, courts tend to read contracts subjectively and look beyond the wording to

                       determine  the  parties'  original  intentions.  Although  Danes  are  pragmatic  in  their

                       commercial  transactions,  it  is  vital  to  develop  a  good  personal  relationship  with  your

                       business partner in order to make a decision. This would imply that any flaws in personal

                       connections may be addressed with the right facts and arguments.


                          C.  Organizational Culture
                          Denmark ranks in the absolute top in terms of flexibility and work-life balance.


                              Many employees in Denmark enjoy a high degree of flexibility, and they are free

                       to distribute their workload according to their unique needs, as long as deadlines are met

                       and tasks are completed. The work-life balance notion is something Danish companies

                       take pleasure in since it decreases stress among employees, stimulates them to perform

                       at  their  best,  and  fosters  creativity.  Employees  are  expected  to  be  proactive  and


                       productive, regardless of their rank or job.

                          Danes are usually informal, open and laid-back at work.

                              When it comes to work, Danes are known for being open, informal, and laid-back,

                       and they value humour and sarcasm, which are prevalent aspects of Danish office culture.

                       Workmates and supervisors communicate directly and openly, producing a comfortable

                                                                                                           23]]></page><page Index="49"><![CDATA[environment in which everyone is acknowledged by their first name and titles are used

                       very often.

                          The work hierarchy is flat as Danes value equality and openness.

                              The  flat  hierarchical  structure  is  a  distinguishing  feature  of  Danish  workplace


                       culture.  Danes  take  pleasure  in  their  egalitarian  worldview,  which  is  typical  of  Danish

                       culture as a whole. This is why titles are so often to used at work and everyone is treated

                       equally and respectfully, regardless of their position in the organization.

                          Danes value socializing.

                              In  Denmark,  socializing  with  colleagues  at  various  occasions  and  events  is


                       regarded as a sign of integration, appreciation, and prospering. The majority of Danes

                       speak  English fluently, and  a growing  number of significant  Danish  corporations  have

                       made English their corporate language. Despite this, social interactions, small chat, and

                       lunch  conversations  are  still  conducted  in  Danish,  and  many  employers  will  actually

                       require Danish abilities when hiring. Internationals are consequently strongly encouraged

                       to study Danish, since it considerably aids and accelerates the process of integrating into

                       Danish society and any Danish workplace.


                       II. Implications of Culture to Marketing Mix

                          A.  Product

                                     In Denmark, when businesses are going to produce a product, it must be

                              minimalist in terms of its packaging and used positive colors that will determine

                              what kind of product the firm offered. in terms of language use, it is okay to use the


                              English language in the description of the product, but using the Danish language

                              it has description translated in Danish will make it better and will be appreciated by

                              Danes. People in demark are also into sustainable and organic products, so this

                              kind of behavior of them might serve as a guide to firms who wanted to plant and

                              produce product or service in Denmark.

                                                                                                           24]]></page><page Index="50"><![CDATA[B.  Price

                              One of the things that makes Denmark a country that has a high cause of living is

                          its pricy goods that are offered in the market.  But those goods are only considered as


                          pricy also because of the currency of the country. Like in the Philippines and Denmark,

                          Denmark’s currency is higher than the Philippine currency.  Nowadays, most Danes

                          or people in Denmark are willing to pay a higher price if the product is organic and

                          social-friendly products.


                          C.  Place
                              Denmark  is  indeed  a  flat  and  small  country,  but  one  of  the  most  developed


                          countries in the world. Distribution and placing products in Denmark don’t require so

                          much to establish. Market in Denmark are both available online and offline so firm can

                          place its product both online and offline.

                          D.  Promotion

                              Being informal and being open have become part of Danes’ characteristics, which

                          can use in promoting products or services but using jokes in promoting is not effective

                          in Danishes, especially in sexist or racist jokes. In addition, when a firm will promote a


                          product in demark on different platforms, it must be honest because trust plays big

                          part in Dane’s people. In addition to promotion, Although English is  the worldwide

                          business language and many Danish individuals can speak it, trade literature may be

                          supplied in English at the beginning of a relationship with a Danish commercial partner.

                          However,  as  the  relationship  progresses,  it  is  planned  that  all  trade  literature  and


                          technical instructions for usage in Denmark would be translated into Danish so that

                          the promotion will be clearly understood by Danish.

                                     Denmark and the Philippines both have embassies in Manila, whereas the

                              Philippines  has  an  embassy  in  Copenhagen.  When  diplomatic  ties  were

                              established on September 28, 1946, the Philippines did not open a permanent

                              mission in Denmark. Notes were exchanged in 1954 signaling intent to proceed

                              into discussions for a formal agreement on air arrangements. Between 1970 and


                              1972, the Philippines exported $8.8 million in goods to Denmark. The majority of

                              Filipino  exports  consisted  of equipment  and  industrial goods.  Until  1979,  when

                              jurisdiction over Denmark was handed to the newly opened Philippine embassy in

                              Stockholm, relations were managed through the Philippine embassy in London. In

                              2007, authority was again shifted to the newly established Philippine embassy in

                              Oslo,  with  diplomatic  contacts  handled  through  an  honorary  consulate  in

                              Copenhagen. Denmark's embassy in Manila was closed in 2002, even though it


                              maintained diplomatic relations with the Philippines through honorary consulates

                              in Manila, Cebu, and Davao.

                                     The Philippines also wanted to export finished clothing, canned fruits and

                              juice, wood products, lumber, and other raw resources to Denmark in the future

                              that  time.  In  the  first  half  of  2008  more  than  $43  million  in  commodities  were


                              transferred  between  Denmark  and  the  Philippines. In  2009,  Denmark  exported

                              500.9 million DKK to the Philippines, while the Philippines exported 306.8 million

                              DKK  to  Denmark.  A  wind  farm  was  also  developed  in  Cagayan  in  2005  with

                              make development more inclusive, the Philippines might learn from Denmark's


                              economic success, which is based on free trade and exports.

                              therefore the Constitutional Act establishes their rights and responsibilities. As a

                              result, Denmark is recognized as an autonomous country since it does not abuse

                              its position.

                                     The present form of the Philippine national government is the consequence

                              of the People Power Revolution of 1986, which deposed long-serving Philippine

                              tyrant Ferdinand Marcos. The ensuing 1987 Constitution established a democratic

                              republic  fashioned  after  the  national  government  of  the  United  States.  The

                              Nature of the Philippine Legal System



                                     With two basic sources of law, the Philippine legal system is a combination

                              of Roman (civil law) and Anglo-American (common law). Civil law covers family

                              law,  succession  law,  contract  law,  property  law,  and  criminal  law,  whereas

                              common law laws and notions can be found in areas such as constitutional law.



                              Source of Law


                                     Statutes  or  statutory  law,  written  law  is  distinguished  from  oral  or

                              customary law. Or regulatory legislation enacted by the government, or common

                              law  enacted  by  the  court.  Statutes  can  be  drafted  by  national,  state,  or  local


                              legislatures.  the  Constitution,  as  well  as  legislative  acts  Constitutions,  treaties,

                                     Jurisprudence or case law, are also interchangeably used with common


                              law. It is founded on precedents, which are court decisions from past cases, rather

                              than on law. All decisions made by administrative and legislative tribunals, such as

                              the Presidential, Senate, or House Electoral Tribunals, are also included.

                              Philippines’ Administrative Rules and Regulations

                                     Administrative  rules  and  regulations  are  orders,  rules,  and  regulations


                              issued by the heads of Departments Bureaus, and other government agencies to

                              effectively  implement  laws  within  their  authority.  To  be  legal,  such  rules  and

                              regulations must be within the allowed limits and jurisdiction of the agency issuing

                              them, as well as in conformity with the conditions of the legislation permitting their

                              issue. The present Administrative Code was drafted in 1917, when the relationship

                              between the people and the government was determined by the colonial rule in


                              place. It is hoped that the new administrative Code would be beneficial to both

                              officers and employees. However, the government and workers must be fairer as

                              a result of the legislation.

                                     Prior  to  the  Administrative  Code  of  1987,  certain  orders,  rules,  and

                              regulations were published in the Official Gazette on a case-by-case basis. As a

                              result, the only place to obtain a copy of the text of these rules and regulations is

                              through  the  originating  government  body. When  the  1987  Administrative  Code


                              (Executive Order No. 292) was promulgated, all governmental and department

                              orders,  rules,  and  regulations  were  required  to  be  filed  with  the  University  of

                              were required to file three (3) certified copies of their orders, rules, and regulations

                              The sculptor's family, Edvard Erikson, is so protective of the statue's copyright that

                              gay-friendly  clubs  across  the  city.  This  is  also  true  in  other  towns  and  cities

                              spend almost USD2 billion on advertising each year. The most popular mediums

                              are  internet  display  and  paid  searches,  followed  by  television.  In  some  ways,

                              Denmark's  advertising  legislation  is  more  conservative  and  concerned  with


                              consumer protection than that of the United States. Other areas are more liberal.

                              Tobacco and pharmaceutical ads on television are prohibited. Commercials aimed

                              specifically  towards  children  are  subject  to  legal  regulations.  The

                              "Markedsforingsloven" establishes the rules and regulations for advertising and

                              marketing  (the  Marketing  Practices  Act).  Denmark  implemented  'opt-in'

                              Consumer Ombudsman is in charge of ensuring that the Marketing Practices Act

                              is  followed.  He  may  act  on  his  own  initiative  or  in  response  to  third-party

                              This means that it must be obvious to the recipient if a blog post, Instagram post,

                              numerous and vary by product. The requirements may be based on Danish or EU

                              legislation  and  regulations.  The  Danish  importer's  support  is  required  for  the

                              exporter  to  comply.  As  a  general  rule,  consumer  products  must  be  labeled  in


                              Danish or in a language that differs only slightly in spelling from Danish. In practice,

                              this implies Norwegian, and in some cases, Swedish. Certain products must be

                              properly labeled with the nation of origin. In rare situations, the importer may mark

                              the products after they arrive in Denmark. Weights and measurements must be

                              given  in  metric  units.  Labels  and  markings  on  packages  must  appropriately


                              describe  the  contents.  The  importer  is  responsible  for  adhering  to  Denmark's

                              marking and labeling rules. Exporters, on the other hand, must carefully follow

                              importers' directions. Failure to do so may result in customs delays and additional

                              costs, perhaps harming future business.

                                     It is also critical to differentiate between marks and labels. A trademark is

                              a sign or pictogram that appears on a product or its packaging. These range in

                              breadth from hazard signs to recommendations of correct recycling and disposal


                              techniques. The purpose of such marks is to offer market surveillance authorities,

                              importers, distributors, and end-users with information about a product's safety,

                              health, energy efficiency, and/or environmental issues. Labels, on the other hand,

                              take the shape of written language or numerical declarations that may or may not

                              be  widely  recognized.  Labels  often  provide  more  specific  information  about  a


                              product, such as measurements or an indication of materials that may be present.

                          D.  Pricing

                                     Exporters frequently quote Danish importers c.i.f. Copenhagen pricing. The

                              c.i.f. pricing covers all domestic freight charges in the United States, as well as

                              ocean/air  freight  and  insurance,  but  excludes  Danish  import  duty  or  VAT.  On

                              commodities,  including  cigarettes  and  tobacco,  alcoholic  beverages,  energy,

                              including  oil  and  gasoline,  and  automobiles.  Despite  a  180  percent  tax  on

                              automobile purchases, there are over two million passenger cars on Danish roads

                              (roughly one for each household). Market research is generally the best way to


                              establish the suitable price for a product in the Danish market. A number of private

                              companies in Denmark conduct market research. The US Foreign Commercial

                              Service in Copenhagen can provide contact information for these businesses.


                          E.  Channels of Distribution


                                     Distribution methods  in Denmark  differ  depending  on the  product.  Non-

                              stocking sales agents are typically in charge of capital goods, commodities, and

                              industrial raw materials. Specialized and high-tech items are usually sold through

                              wholly  owned  subsidiaries,  of  which  there  are  over  400.  These  account  for  a

                              sizable share of US corporate sales of goods and services in Denmark. Consumer

                              goods are typically offered through importing brokers and wholesalers, however

                              big retail and department shops are increasingly importing directly. Chain stores


                              dominate the non-food retail trade.

                                     Two huge retail chains (COOP and Salling Group) dominate the Danish

                              food retail sector, accounting for almost 70% of the total food retail market. These

                              companies have substantial in-house wholesale and import businesses. Denmark

                              has approximately 30 significant independent food product importers.

                          A.  Product

                                     The  product  that  is  going  to  enter  Denmark  must  first  legalize  by  the


                              authority of the country, the product must pass the criteria of the country, and must

                              not include illegal o banned material/ingredients like drugs. After inspection, the

                              product can be registered for the intellectual properties to also got protected by the

                              authority.


                          B.  Price
                                     In Denmark, industrial products, import duties normally range between 5


                              and  14  percent.  Furthermore,  the  importer  must  pay  a  25%  Value  Added  Tax

                              (VAT) on the total of the landed (c.i.f.) cost plus the duty. The price of the product

                              tends  to  get  higher  or  lower  depending  on  expenses  and  taxes  including  in

                              manufacturing and distributing it.

                          C.  Place

                                     In Denmark, there are also places that are restricted and under government

                              protection. So, when a firm is planning to establish a physical store or factory it


                              should be consulted and legalized by authority.

                       advertising and communications. In Denmark, there are various ways to advertise.

                       Although only TV2 broadcasts commercials, radio advertising is immensely popular. The

                       Tidende and Politiken, as well as Jyllandsposten in Jutland, are powerful. The Internet is

                       the fastest expanding advertising media, and let us not ignore the role of trade

                       newspapers. The trade press is vast, and the publications are effective. But in promoting

                              In Denmark, competing with local and global products may be the challenging part

                       because  Denmark  was  known  as  an  open  country  that  encourages  and  welcome

                       businesses. Aside from competitors, Danish unique characteristics and culture must be

                       learned for the business goods also.



                              In terms of the distribution, there is no need to worry because the internet is widely

                       available  in  the  country and  Denmark’s geography  is  not  as  big  as  other  countries  in

                       Europe, so it is easier to reach customers from a different place in the country.


                              Since Denmark also has advanced technology, other options for a transaction can

                       be  done  online.  Denmark  is  also  open  in  different  payment  options  that  might  give

                       convenience to the business itself and to the customers.



                              Furthermore, Denmark's characteristics may surprise a company or new

                       immigrant in the country due to its forthrightness and openness. So, if a company is

                       going to hire a Danish employee, it must be prepared to deal with it and be accustomed

                       to it. Danish people value their trust, so when a company earns it, it must keep and


                       treasure it.

                       State University-Tanza Campus, Tanza, Cavite. January 2022. Adviser: Ms. Debbie
                       Rose B. Fabian.

                              This study was conducted to determine the online shopping personality types

                       and consumers' buying behavior in Cavite. Specifically, the study aimed to determine


                       the demographic profiles of the participants; describe the online shopping personality

                       type of consumers; identify the type of buying behavior of online shoppers; determine

                       if there is a significant difference between their personality type and buying behavior

                       when grouped according to their demographic characteristics.

                              The study followed a descriptive design. It was used to describe the online


                       shopping personality types of consumers. It was also used to identify online shoppers'

                       buying  behavior  and  determine  if  there  is  a  significant  difference  between  their

                       personality type and buying behavior when grouped according to their demographic

                       characteristics. Furthermore, the researchers used quota sampling to determine the

                       number of participants.

                              The  data  were  gathered  using  self-administered  survey  questionnaires  that

                       were distributed to 200 online shoppers in Cavite.


                                  The researchers gathered data from September to December 2021. As a result,

                       most  of the  participants  belonged  to the  age  bracket  of  25-40  years  old  and  were

                       female. Also, most of them are employed and have a monthly income ranging from

                       10,000 and below.

                              Furthermore, researchers gathered data that online shopping personality types


                       are  shopping  lovers  and  fun-seekers,  and  consumers'  buying  behavior  is  complex

                       buying behavior, dissonance-reducing behavior, and habitual buying behavior. Based

                       on the result, there is a significant difference between online shopping personality type,

                       is a significant difference between buying behavior in age and employment status. The

                       null  hypothesis  formulated  for  this  research  study  was  no  significant  difference

                       between their personality types and buying behavior when grouped according to their


                       demographic profile. The null hypothesis was rejected.

                              Most of the participants belonged to the age bracket of 25-40 years old and

                       were female, and most of them were employed and had monthly incomes ranging from

                       10,000 and below. The personality types of consumers were fun-seekers, and the type

                       of buying behavior of online shoppers was complex buying behavior. Meanwhile, in


                       the  significant  difference  between  personality  types  and  buying  behavior  when

                       grouped according to their demographic profile, it is shown that age, sex, employment

                       status, and monthly income have a significant difference in business users, fearful

                       personality  types  and  buying  behavior  have  a  significant  age  difference,  and

                       employment status in variety-seeking buying behavior.

                              E-retailers  can  use  the  findings  of  this  study  to  allocate  their  marketing

                       resources  better  and  create  a  more  successful  marketing  mix  for  each  of  their


                       products. Future researchers will use the study as another reference or source if they

                       have  the  same study  or  are  likely  about the  online  shoppers'  personality  type  and

                       buying behavior. Marketers can collect ideas about the typologies of online shoppers

                       and their buying behavior. Also, this study would help the psychologist to understand

                       customers' behavior with a high degree of reliability.

                                                           INTRODUCTION



                              Online shopping is an easy solution to the busy life in today's world. There has

                       been  a  massive  change  in  customers'  shopping  in  the  past  decade.  Despite

                       consumers'  continued  buying  from  a  physical  store,  the  users  or  buyers  feel  very

                       convenient  with  online  shopping.  Online  shopping  saves  crucial  time  for  modern

                       people because they get so preoccupied that they are unable or reluctant to devote


                       much time to shopping.(Rahman, 2018).

                              Consumers decide to purchase products through e-commerce. The behaviors

                       themselves — identifying a problem or deciding to make a purchase — are based on

                       ever-evolving  expectations  and  needs.  And  while  needs  look  different  for  every

                       shopper, the new expectations that drive online consumer behavior are entrenched in

                       commonality (Wenzl, 2021).

                              The extent of involvement in a purchase decision determines consumer buying


                       behavior. The most common types of buying behavior are complex buying behavior,

                       dissonance-reducing buying behavior, habitual buying behavior, and variety-seeking

                       buying behavior (Clootrack, 2021).]]></page><page Index="98"><![CDATA[2


                              There  are  different  online  shopper  personality  types  or  behavioral

                       characteristics  of  shoppers.  It  includes  adventurous  explorers,  shopping  lovers,

                       business  users,  fearful  browsers,  shopping  avoiders,  and  fun-seekers.  Each  has

                       certain traits, and skillful marketing professionals stress the importance of learning


                       each  type  to  design  attractive  shopping  services  for  members  of  every  customer

                       segment (Bajaj, 2018).

                              Statistics show that only two percent of Filipino netizens have purchased goods

                       or services online before the pandemic. Fashion apparel, athletic goods, and footwear

                       were the greatest sellers in the pre-COVID era. In the post-COVID age, a new category


                       has developed. Personal protection equipment, sanitary supplies, and consumables

                       have  all  become  hot  commodities  in  recent  years.  Consumers  have  put  off  non-

                       essential purchases due to their time spent at home (Masigan, 2020).

                              Because of the growth of e-commerce in the Philippines due to COVID-19,

                       consumers  chose  to  buy  essential  and  non-essential  goods  online.  This  research

                       describes consumers' personality types and buyers' behavior when they shop online.]]></page><page Index="99"><![CDATA[3

                       Objectives of the Study

                              The study mainly aimed to determine the online shopping personality types

                              Specifically, the study aimed to:

                                     a.  age;

                                     b.  sex;

                                     c.  occupation; and


                                     d.  monthly income;

                                 and  buying  behavior  when  grouped  according  to  their  demographic

                                 characteristics;]]></page><page Index="100"><![CDATA[4


                       Hypothesis


                              The  null  hypothesis formulated for this  research  study  was  that there  is  no

                       significant  difference  between  their  personality  type  and  buying  behavior  when

                       grouped according to their demographic characteristics. It was accepted based on the

                       result of the study


                       Conceptual Framework of the Study

                              This section presents the framework used by the researchers in presenting the

                       study. It illustrates how the concept is interrelated to achieve the study's objectives.

                       The variables being studied are online shopping personality and their buying behavior

                       on  essential  and  non-essential  goods.  According  to  Bajaj  (2018),  there  are  many

                       different online shopper personality types or behavioral characteristics of shoppers,


                       including adventurous explorers, shopping lovers, business users, fearful browsers,

                       shopping avoiders, and fun-seekers.

                              The  study's  demographic  characteristics,  age,  sex,  monthly  income,  and

                       occupation  were  determined  as  the  type  of  online  shopping  personality  and  their

                       buying  behavior.  After  identifying  those  variables,  the  researchers  described  the

                       significant difference between online shopping personality type and buying behavior


                       when grouped according to their demographic profile.

                       Significance of the Study


                              The study results would be beneficial to E-retailers to allocate their marketing

                       resources  better  and  create  a  more  successful  marketing  mix  for  each  of  their

                       products. Also, it will give them valuable insight into the behavioral features of each

                       consumer segment and their buying behavior.


                              Furthermore,  future  researchers  will  use  the  study  as  another  reference  or

                       source if they have the same study or likely about the online shoppers' personality type

                       and  buying  behavior. This  research  will  give  them  an  idea  about  the typologies  of

                       online shoppers and their buying behavior because they are responsible for creating

                       an involvement chain between the customer and the product or service offered by the

                       company.


                       Time and Place of the Study

                              The  study  was  conducted  in  Cavite.  The  researcher  gathered  data  from

                       September to December 2021.

                       Scope and Limitations of the Study

                              The study focused on determining the demographic profile of the participants

                       in terms of age, sex, occupation, and monthly income, the online shoppers’ personality


                       types, and the type of their buying behavior. The online shopping personality types

                       under  study  are  adventurous  explorers,  shopping  lovers,  business  users,  fearful

                       browsers, shopping avoiders, and fun-seekers. The buying behavior types included

                       are complex buying behavior, dissonance-reducing buying behavior, habitual buying

                       behavior, and variety-seeking buying behavior.

                              The study selected participants from Cavite. The result of the study was limited

                       to the responses of consumers buying online.]]></page><page Index="102"><![CDATA[6


                       Definition of Terms

                       This section presents the terms that were used in the study:

                              Adventurous  explorers believe  online  shopping  is  fun.  They  are  likely  the

                       opinion leaders for all things online.


                              Business users use the Internet primarily for business purposes.

                              Buying behavior refers to people's decision processes and acts in buying and

                       using products.

                              Complex buying behavior occurs when the consumer is highly involved with

                       the  purchase  and  when  there  are  significant  differences  between  brands.  This


                       behavior can be associated with purchasing a new home or a personal computer.

                              Dissonance-reducing  buying  behavior occurs  when  a  consumer  buys  an

                       easily available product.

                              E-commerce refers to a business model that allows companies and individuals

                       to buy and sell goods and services over the Internet.

                              Fearful browser fears about credit card security, shipping charges, and buying

                       products sight unseen were overcome.


                              Fun seekers see the entertainment value on the Internet, but buying things

                       online frightens them.

                              Habitual buying behavior occurs when consumers buy products that they use

                       for their daily routine, they do not put a lot of thought.

                              Online shoppers are those who purchase products and services online.


                              Personality is  a  characteristic  way  of  thinking,  feeling,  and  behaving.  It

                       embraces moods, attitudes, and opinions and is most clearly expressed in interactions

                       with other people.

                              Shopping avoiders do not like to wait for products to be shipped to them, and

                       they like seeing merchandise in person before buying.

                              Shopping  lovers enjoy  buying  online  and  do  so  frequently.  They  are

                       competent computer users and will likely continue their shopping habits.]]></page><page Index="103"><![CDATA[7

                                                 REVIEW OF RELATED LITERATURE



                              This  section  contains  different  articles  that  are  used  to  support  the

                       conceptualization  of  the  study.  It  also  includes  relevant  studies  that  support  and


                       contribute in the development of the study.

                       Online Shopping During Pandemic

                              In  the  past,  consumers  around  the  world  had  been  more  skeptical  about

                       shopping  online;  however,  with  time,  that  sentiment  has  decreased  considerably,

                       especially during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.


                               In  2020,  over  80  percent  of  consumers  across  the  globe  shopped  online:

                       reaching nearly 90 percent each; the leading regions that year were South America

                       and Asia. North America had the lowest share, with just over three in four consumers

                       buying  items  on  the  internet.  The  online  store  that  was  used  most  frequently  by

                       shoppers worldwide was Amazon.com. Retail e-commerce sales worldwide amounted

                       to 4.28 trillion US dollars, and e-retail revenues are projected to grow to 5.4 trillion US

                       dollars in 2022. Online shopping is one of the most popular online activities worldwide.


                              According to Campos (n.d.), as cited by Masigan (2020), 91 percent of Filipino

                       internet  users  searched for goods  and  services  to  purchase  during  the  quarantine

                       period. Of all those who searched, 76 percent consummated the transaction. This is a

                       clear  indication  that  Filipinos  are  finally  warming  up  to  e-commerce.  From  a  sales

                       turnover of $500 million in 2015, e-commerce in the Philippines is seen to top $12


                       billion by the year 2025. It already realized $3 billion in 2019. In the first six months of

                       2020, growth has already doubled in terms of the number of buyers and the peso value

                       of purchases compared to 2019.

                              A survey conducted by Global Web (2020) shows that 48 percent of Filipinos

                       plan to do more online shopping after the pandemic is over. During the pre-COVID era,

                       fashion apparel, sporting goods, and footwear were the best sellers at 54 percent, 18

                       percent, and 10 percent of the sales mix. A new category has emerged in the post-]]></page><page Index="105"><![CDATA[9


                       COVID era. Nowadays, essentials that include personal protective equipment, sanitary

                       goods, and groceries have emerged as brisk sellers.

                                  Time  spent  at  home  has  caused  consumers  to  delay  any  non-essential

                       purchases. This has led to pent-up demand. A recent survey indicates that when the


                       Filipinos  are  able,  they  will  prioritize  purchasing  clothing  at  19  percent,  home

                       appliances and devices at 18 percent, home furniture and accessories at 15 percent,

                       electronic gadgets at 15 percent, and smartphones at 11 percent.

                                   According  to  a  survey  conducted  by  Rakuten  Insight,  41  percent  of  the

                       respondents stated they purchased more online during the COVID-19 pandemic in the


                       Philippines as of May 2020. In contrast, only 20 percent said they did not make online

                       purchases (Statista Research Department, 2021).

                              The pandemic has changed the focus to the top priority of better health. That

                       is why consumers' thoughts have changed toward the basic needs, increasing the

                       demand for hygiene, staples, and cleaning products while decreasing the order for

                       non-essential  categories.  For  the  consumers,  the  top  priority  is  personal  health,

                       followed by that of family and friends. Financial security, food, personal safety, and


                       medical security are other priorities. People focus on products with health defense

                       benefits on beverage and food products, especially those with immunity benefits and

                       natural products. Given this is an unpredictable period, we are uncertain about the

                       economic future. Thus, many consumers are concentrating on their short-term and

                       primary needs. During crises, consumers tend to focus on goods and services at low


                       prices, requiring a tangible reason to go for more expensive ones (Bohlen, Carlotti &

                       Mihas, n.d.as cited by Sharma, 2020).

                              Due to the sudden outbreak of COVID-19, e-commerce platforms saw a surge

                       in their activities as people actively resorted to online buying of the respondents who

                       have  purchased  essential  goods  from  online  platforms  mainly  due  to  the  COVID

                       outbreak. Groceries and hygiene products were given preference over luxury products

                       during  the  pandemic  of  the  population  purchased  groceries  and  59.5  purchased]]></page><page Index="106"><![CDATA[10


                       hygiene products online, while 31 of the population purchased clothing apparel and

                       16.8 purchased ready-made food items from various online platforms. Hygiene and

                       health were the most important things to be maintained during the pandemic to avoid

                       infection. People were seen shifting their online platforms due to scarcity of goods on


                       their preferred platforms and trust and hygiene maintenance issues. Respondents will

                       be ready to shift the platforms due to scarcity of products, 17 claimed to be loyal to

                       their daily online platforms, and 48 were still confused. (Salunke P. 2020)

                              According to the study of Laguna (2020), changes in the popularity of searches

                       related  to  food  were  observed  during  the  lockdown  period.  People's  interest  in


                       restaurants decreased, and interest in recipes and delivery reached huge popularity,

                       comparable  or  higher  than  searches  related  to  health  (symptoms  and  spread).

                       People's concerns about diet decreased, but the interest in food products like flour,

                       bread, fruits, milk, and chicken (related to cooking, baking, and storage conditions)

                       increased.

                              Geographically,  38  percent  of  all  e-commerce  transactions  occur  in  Metro

                       Manila,  nine  percent  in  Cavite  and  Laguna,  six  percent  in  Cebu,  six  percent  in


                       Pampanga  and  Bulacan,  three  percent  in  Davao,  and  three  percent  in  Rizal,  two

                       percent in Iloilo, and two percent in Batangas. The rest of the regions are too small to

                       be categorized. Cash on delivery is still the preferred mode of payment, comprising 67

                       percent of all transactions. Credit cards follow this at 24 percent. Paypal has a five

                       percent  share  of  payment  transactions,  while  G-Cash  has  a  two  percent  share.  A


                       massive  79  percent  of  all  e-commerce  transactions  are  consummated  over  the

                       smartphone (Masigan, 2020).

                       Demographics Characteristics of Online Shoppers

                              The Philippine population of 110.3 million people skews towards a young, tech-

                       savvy group of Millennial and Gen Z consumers (the country's average age is 25.7

                       years). Unsurprisingly, these consumers are prolific users of the Internet, spending an

                       average of 10 hours and 56 minutes2 browsing the Internet each day. Nearly half of]]></page><page Index="107"><![CDATA[11


                       that time—4 hours and 15 minutes—is spent on social media. Like other countries in

                       Southeast Asia, the advent of powerful and affordable mobile devices is at the heart of

                       this surge of Internet usage among Filipinos. The Philippines has been a mobile-first

                       nation since 2014, and this can be seen in Hootsuite, and We Are Social's findings that


                       98.5 percent of adult Filipinos use mobile phones of any type. In contrast, only 77.3

                       percent have a laptop or desktop computer (Bahasa & Leong, 2019).

                              Filipinos shop online to find products not found locally or in brick-and-mortar

                       stores. Social media listening will go a long way towards understanding the unmet

                       needs of Filipino online shoppers. (Benedict, 2021)


                              Benedict (2019) reveals that 67 percent (73.91 million) of the country's total

                       population of 107.3 million people are active Internet users. 38.88 million. Based on

                       the same report, people in the Philippines have purchased a product or service online.

                       25 to 34-year-olds, followed by 16 to 24-year-olds, shop at least 3 to 6 times a week.

                       These groups are more likely to shop online every day than all the age groups. More

                       women (11.5 percent) shop online than men (8.2 percent), even if fewer women have

                       credit cards. Cash on Delivery is still the preferred payment method in the Philippines,


                       with  71  percent  of  the  Philippines'  population  being  unbanked.  The  increase  in  e-

                       commerce adoption was nationwide and not limited to urban areas.

                              In terms of demographics, 72 percent of Filipino online shoppers are female,

                       while 28 percent are male. Age-wise, 45 percent are between 25 to 35 years old, 22

                       percent are between 18 to 24 years old, 16 percent are between 35 to 44 years old,


                       and 17 percent are 45 years old or older (Masigan, 2020).

                                  According  to  Goldring  and  Azab  (2020),  the  study  compares  differences  in

                       market mavens between two generations: the young adult portion of Gen Z, born from

                       approximately 1997 through 2012, to their Gen X parents, taken from 1965 through

                       1980,  using  a  field  study  of  traits,  shopping  habits,  and  social  media  behaviors.

                       Building  on  generational  cohort  theory  conducted  paired  comparisons  across

                       generations  and  in  mavens  versus  non-mavens.  They  found  differences  between]]></page><page Index="108"><![CDATA[12


                       mavens  and  non-mavens  related  to  value  consciousness,  marketplace  interfaces,

                       status  consumption,  need  for  uniqueness,  and  social  outcomes  decision  making.

                       Significant differences were also found between Ganz's and GenX's mavens regarding

                       status consumption and social outcomes decision making. We also analyzed social


                       media  engagement  by  product  category  and  platform  and  suggested  managerial

                       implications.

                              According to the study by Kiyuci (2012), the Internet is an essential facilitator

                       for humans. Humans use this medium in almost every phase as a shopping medium;

                       the Internet attracts humans, attracting researchers. In this research, younger people


                       can adopt newer technologies to adapt to the Internet as a shopping tool. It is tried to

                       define college of education students' online shopping behavior and online shopping

                       activities; research results show that male students are more familiar and have a more

                       positive  attitude  than  female  students.  Teacher  students  who  have  more  monthly

                       income and have more internet self-efficacy have a positive attitude and intention to

                       shop online. Participants with credit cards have no more familiarity and less anxiety

                       concerning internet shopping.


                       Consumer Typologies

                              Consumer typologies classify heterogeneous populations into meaningful and

                       distinct subgroups (Lee, Kim, & Lee, 2013). From a marketing perspective, consumer

                       typologies provide a basis for more precise and effective segmentation, targeting, and

                       positioning strategies (Yankelovich & Meer, 2006).


                              According  to  Teodorescu  et  al  (2008),  the  typology  of  buyers  and  buying

                       actions  contracts  are  specific  categories  of  consumer  behavior,  determining  group

                       buyers and buying actions in classes, to fragment the markets. Market fragmentation

                       through buyer typology and/or segmentation is presently characterized by a multitude

                       of theoretical approaches and are especially generated by the common practice in the

                       respective business. These two concepts are used for the same purpose, the essential

                       difference  being  their  starting  point:  the  segmentation  fragments  the  markets  as  a]]></page><page Index="109"><![CDATA[13


                       whole, while the typology of the buyer and of buying actions generate classifications

                       starting from individual cases.

                              There  are  many  different  online  shopper  personality  types,  or  behavioral

                       characteristics of shoppers. Each has certain traits, and skillful marketing professionals


                       stress the importance of learning each type in order to design a shopping services that

                       are attractive to members of each type or customer segment (Bajaj, 2018). Here are

                       some of the online shopping personality types:

                              Adventurous explorers.  Adventurous explorers, (30% of online spending)

                       are  a  small  segment  that  presents  a  large  opportunity.  They  require  little  special


                       attention by Internet vendors because retailers should nurture and cultivate them to be

                       online community builders and shopping advocates.

                              Shopping  lovers.  Shopping  lovers,  (24%  of  online  spending)  enjoy  buying

                       online  and  do  so  frequently.  They  are  competent  computer  users  and  will  likely

                       continue their shopping habits. They also spread the word to others about joys of online

                       shopping  whenever  they  have  the  opportunity.  They  represent  an  ideal  target  for

                       retailers.


                              Business users. Business users, (19% of online spending) are among the

                       most computer literate. They use the Internet primarily for business purposes. They

                       take a serious interest in what it can do for their professional life. They don’t view online

                       shopping as novel and aren’t usually champions of the practice.


                              Fearful browsers. Fearful browsers, (5% of online spending) are on the cusp

                       of buying online. They are capable Internet and computer users, spending a good deal

                       of time “window shopping.” They could become a significant buying group if their fears

                       about credit card security, shipping charges and buying products sight unseen were


                       overcome.

                              Shopping  avoiders.  Shopping  avoiders,  (3%  of  online  spending)  have  an

                       appealing income level, but their values make them a poor target for online retailers.]]></page><page Index="110"><![CDATA[14


                       They  don’t  like  to  wait  for  products  to  be  shipped  to  them  and  they  like  seeing

                       merchandise in person before buying. They have online shopping issues that retailers

                       will not easily be able to overcome.

                              Fun seekers. Fun seekers, (2% of online spending) are the least wealthy and


                       least  educated market  segment. They  see  entertainment  value  in  the  Internet,  but

                       buying things online frightens them. Although security and privacy issues might be

                       overcome, the spending power of the segment suggests that only a marginal long-term

                       payback would be possible (Bajaj, 2018).

                              According to Bajaj (2018), many consumers (online) have different traits and


                       habits. Since every industry dynamic are different, so are the consumer habits.

                              Meanwhile, Brophy and Hodge (2021) identified eight types of shoppers on

                       physical stores.

                              The bargain hunter. Most retailers regularly encounter bargain hunters in their

                       shops. Also called discount shoppers, bargain hunters are usually armed with coupons

                       or discount codes, know when all of the best sales are, and rarely buy without some

                       sort of deal in hand.


                              Whereas some shoppers are looking for something sentimental, the bargain

                       hunter’s  purchase  will  be  primarily  determined  by  price  and  a  sense  that  they  are

                       saving money. The bargain hunters need sales and deals.

                              The browser. Browsing customers, sometimes called wandering customers,

                       are shoppers who are not looking for a particular item or to purchase from a specific


                       location. They happened to come across your store and are curious as to what you

                       have to offer. The browsing customer is motivated to make a purchase based on an

                       experience or a connection.

                              The showrooming customers. This type of shopping is particularly popular

                       among  people  in  the  market  for  furniture,  appliances,  or  other  large,  expensive

                       products that are supposed to last. While large companies like Ikea have molded their

                       entire  business  model  on  the  show  rooming  customer,  show  rooming  can  be]]></page><page Index="111"><![CDATA[15


                       problematic for small businesses because often, shoppers will view your product only

                       to purchase it from another retailer at a lower price. If you can give the show rooming

                       customer’s  peace  of  mind  and  simplify  their  shopping  process,  you  will  meet  their

                       needs and convert them into an in-store sale.


                              The impulse shoppers. Impulse shoppers make unplanned purchases based

                       on items that appeal to them in the moment. I am sure that you have been in line at

                       the grocery store or convenience shop and have grabbed a pack of chips at checkout.

                       That is an impulse buy. Typically, impulse shopping is often buying small items that

                       catch people’s attention.


                              The  mission-driven  shopper.  Mission-driven  buyers  are  on  the  hunt  for

                       particular products or are shopping from a list. They are even sometimes called “list

                       shoppers” because they so often come with a physical litany of things they want to

                       buy. Others have termed them “need-based” and “reluctant” shoppers because, for

                       them,  buying  is  driven  strictly  by  need  and  not  because  they  necessarily  enjoy

                       shopping.

                              The indecisive patron. Indecisive shoppers are looking to make a purchase


                       but  are  reluctant  or  hesitant  to  do  so  because  of  price,  information  overload,  or

                       insufficient information. I know I ran into this type of shopper all the time at my store.

                       They would try things on, but struggle to make a decision and constantly make excuses

                       as to why they shouldn’t buy the piece.

                              The educated consumer. The educated shopper researches products or a


                       store’s  inventory  online,  reads  customer  reviews,  and  scans  general  pricing

                       information before visiting the store. They also typically have an idea of what they want

                       to buy by the time they make it in.

                              The  loyal  customer.  Loyal  customers,  or  regular  customers,  are  every

                       retailer’s  favorite.  The  loyal  customer  is  someone  who  visits  your  shop  often  and

                       makes regular purchases. You might even know them by name and have a rapport

                       with them (Brophy & Hodge, 2021).]]></page><page Index="112"><![CDATA[16


                              According  to  Gautam  and  Prasad  (2019),  develops  a  typology  based  upon

                       motivations for online shopping. They identified the types of online shoppers labeled

                       as  fear  shoppers,  convenience  shoppers,  novice  seekers,  trusted  buyers  and

                       traditional  shoppers.  The  fear  shoppers  worried  about  their  security  and  privacy


                       concern. The convenience shoppers are more motivated by convenience. The novice

                       seekers  are  substantially  more  motivated  by  information  seeking  across  retail

                       alternatives. Trusted buyers are moderately motivated by quality and variety seeking.

                       The traditional shoppers are more motivated by physical store orientation.


                       Consumer Buying Behavior

                              Consumer buying behavior refers to consumers' actions taken (both on and

                       offline) before buying a product or service. This process may include consulting search


                       engines, engaging with social media posts, or various other actions. It is valuable for

                       businesses to understand this process because it helps companies better tailor their

                       marketing  initiatives  to  the  marketing  efforts  that  have  successfully  influenced

                       consumers to buy in the past (JD, TEAM 2020).

                                  A consumer's buying decision depends on the products they need to buy. A

                       consumer's behavior while buying a coffee is different from while purchasing a car.


                       Based on observations, it is clear that more complex and expensive purchases involve

                       higher deliberation and many more participants.

                                  Consumer  buying  behavior  is  determined  by  the  level  of  involvement  in  a

                       purchase decision. The amount of risk involved in purchase also determines the buying

                       behavior.  Higher-priced  goods  tend  to  have  a  higher  risk,  thereby  seeking  higher

                       involvement in buying decisions. The following are the types of purchasing behavior.

                              Complex  buying  behavior.  Complex  buying  behavior  is  encountered


                       particularly  when  consumers  are  buying  an  expensive  product.  In  this  infrequent

                       transaction, consumers are highly involved in the purchase decision. Consumers will

                       research thoroughly before committing to invest.]]></page><page Index="113"><![CDATA[17


                              Consumer  behaves  very  different  when  buying  an  expensive  product  or  a

                       product that is unfamiliar to him. When the risk of buying a product is very high, a

                       consumer consults friends, family, and experts before making the decision.

                              For  example,  when  a  consumer  is  buying  a car for  the first  time,  it’s  a  big


                       decision as it involves high economic risk. There is a lot of thought on how it looks,

                       how his/her friends and family will react, how will his/her social status change after

                       buying the car, and so on.

                              In complex buying behavior, the buyer will pass through a learning process. He

                       will first develop beliefs about the product, then attitudes, and then making a thoughtful


                       purchase choice.

                              For  complex  buying  behavior  customers,  marketers  should  have  a  deep

                       understanding  of  the  products.  It  is  expected  that  they  help  the  consumer  to

                       understand about their product. It is important to create advertising message in a way

                       that influences the buyer’s beliefs and attitudes.

                              Dissonance-reducing  buying  behavior.  In  dissonance-reducing  buying

                       behavior  consumer  involvement  is  very  high.  This  might  be  due  to  high  price  and


                       infrequent  purchase.  In  addition,  there  is  a  low  availability  of  choices with  less

                       significance differences among brands. In this type, a consumer buys a product that is

                       easily available.

                              Consumers will be forced to buy goods that do not have too many choices and

                       therefore consumers will be left with limited decision making. Based on the products


                       available,  time  limitation  or  the  budget  limitation,  consumers  buy  certain  products

                       without a lot of research.

                              For example, a consumer who is looking for a new collapsible table that can be

                       taken for a camping, quickly decides on the product based on few brands available.

                       The main criteria here will be the use and the feature of the collapsible table and the

                       budget available with him.]]></page><page Index="114"><![CDATA[18


                              Marketers  should  run  after-sale  service  camps  that  deliver  focused

                       messaging.  These campaigns should aim to support consumers and convince them

                       to continue with their choice of their brand. These marketing campaigns should focus

                       on building repeat purchases and referrals by offering discounts and incentives.


                              Habitual  buying  behavior.  Habitual  buying  behavior is  depicted  when  a

                       consumer has low involvement in a purchase decision. In this case the consumer is

                       perceiving only a few significant differences between brands.

                              When consumers are buying products that they use for their daily routine, they

                       do not put a lot of thought. They either buy their favorite brand or the one that they use


                       regularly – or the one available in the store or the one that costs the least.

                              For example, while a consumer buys a loaf of bread, he tends to buy the brand

                       that he is familiar with without actually putting a lot of research and time. Many products

                       fit into this category. Everyday use products, such as salt, sugar, biscuits, toilet paper,

                       and black pepper all fit into this product category.

                              Consumer just go for it and buy it – there is no brand loyalty. Consumers do

                       not research or need information regarding purchase of such products.


                              Habitual  buying  behavior  is  influenced  by  radio,  television  and  print  media.

                       Moreover, consumers are buying based on brand familiarity. Hence marketers must

                       use repetitive advertisements to build brand familiarity. Further to initiate product trial,

                       marketers should use tactics like price drop promotions and sales promotions.

                              Marketers should attract consumers using visual symbols and imagery in their


                       advertising. Consumers can easily remember visual advertisements and can associate

                       with a brand.

                              Variety  seeking  buying  behavior.  In  variety  seeking  consumer  behavior,

                       consumer involvement is low. There are significant differences between brands. Here

                       consumers often do a lot of brand switching. The cost of switching products is low, and

                       hence  consumers  might  want  to  try  out  new  products  just  out  of  curiosity  or]]></page><page Index="115"><![CDATA[19


                       boredom. Consumers  here,  generally  buy  different  products  not  because  of

                       dissatisfaction but mainly with an urge to seek variety.

                              For example, a consumer likes to buy a cookie and choose a brand without

                       putting much thought to it. Next time, the same consumer might may choose a different


                       brand out of a wish for a different taste. Brand switching occurs often and without

                       intention.

                              Brands have to adopt different strategies for such type of consumer behavior.

                       The  market  leader  will  persuade  habitual  buying  behavior  by  influencing  the  shelf

                       space. The shelf will display a large number of related but different product versions.


                              Marketers  avoid  out-of-stock  conditions,  sponsor  frequent  advertising,  offer

                       lower  prices,  discounts,  deals,  coupons  and  free  samples  to attract consumers.

                       (Clootrack, 2021).

                       Consumer Buying Behavior towards Online Shopping

                              Today’s  online  consumers  have  more  control  and  bargaining  power  than

                       consumers  of  conventional  stores  because  the  Internet  offers  more  interaction

                       between  customers  and  products/service  providers  and  greater  availability  of


                       information  about  products  and  services.  The  Internet  has  fundamentally  changed

                       customers’  notions  of  convenience,  speed,  price,  product  information,  and  service

                       (Patro, 2018).

                              Online  shopping  has  unique  characteristics,  emphasizing  that  the  lack  of

                       physical interaction tends to be the critical impediment in online retail sales, followed


                       by the privacy of individual information and security of financial transactions over the

                       Internet (Esha, Sultana & Molnar, 2018).

                              Consumer attitudes toward online shopping usually been determined by two


                       factors; one is trust, and another is perceived benefits. Therefore, trust and perceived

                       benefits  seem  to  be  the  critical  conjectures  of  consumer  behavior  toward  online

                       shopping (Sultana & Chakravorty, 2018).]]></page><page Index="116"><![CDATA[20


                       Also, demographic variables such as age, gender, and income level play a facilitating

                       role because they influence consumer perception and consumer behavior that drives

                       them towards online shopping (Molnar, 2018).

                              Huseynov and Yıldırım (2014) emphasized that the lack of physical interaction


                       tends to be the critical impediment in online retail sales, followed by the privacy of

                       individual  information  and  security  of  financial  transactions  over  the  Internet.

                       Demangeot and Broderick (2016) also revealed that perceived ease of use does not

                       affect the behavioral pattern but is rather influenced by security and privacy issues. No

                       relationship  is  built  between  the  customer  and  the  online  shop  in  the  presence  of


                       perceived online risk, even if a customer spent hours on the Internet (Zuroni & Goh,

                       2012).

                              Day-by-day tastes, preferences, and choices vary regarding different factors

                       such as Internet emergence. However, this development needs more understanding

                       of the consumer’s behavior. Consumer behavior research identifies a general model

                       of  buying  behavior  that  depicts  the  processes  used  by  consumers  in  making  a

                       purchase decision (Vrender, 2016). Those designs are paramount to the marketer as


                       they  can  explain  and  predict  consumer  purchase  behavior.  Jarvenpaa  and  Todd

                       (1997) proposed a model of general attitude, behavior, and shopping intention towards

                       Internet shopping. The design includes several indicators classified into four broad

                       categories: product value, quality services offered through the website, the shopping

                       experience, and the risk perception of online shopping.


                              Chang, Cheung, and Lai (2016) studied categories of variables that drive online

                       shopping activity. In their study, they divided the features into three broad categories.

                       Perceived characteristics of the web sale channel are the first one which includes risk,

                       online shopping experiences, advantage, service quality, and trust.

                              The  second  category  is  a  website  and  product  features:  risk  reduction

                       measures, site features, and product characteristics; and the last group is consumer

                       characteristics.  Various  features,  demographic  variables,  consumer  shopping]]></page><page Index="117"><![CDATA[21


                       orientations, consumer innovativeness and psychological variables, computer, Internet

                       knowledge, and usages drive consumer characteristics. Consumer attitudes toward

                       online shopping usually been determined by two factors; one is trust, and another is

                       perceived  benefits  (Hoque,  Ali,  &  Mahfuz,  2016).  Therefore,  trust  and  perceived


                       benefits  seem  to  be  the  critical  conjectures  of  consumer  behavior  toward  online

                       shopping  (Al-Debei,  Akroush,  &  Ashouri,  2016;  Hajli,  2017).  Moreover,  information

                       quality,  merchandise  attribute,  website  design,  transaction  capability,  payment,

                       security/privacy,  delivery,  self-consciousness,  state  of  mind,  the  consumer’s  time

                              Time-saving  and  available  varieties  of  products  are  the  main  grounds  for

                       shopping online. All these four factors motivate an online shopper to buy over the

                       Internet.  Therefore,  companies  should  design  strategies  and  develop  varieties  of

                       products to attract and retain online shoppers. This finding also confirms the findings

                       of Gong (2013) and Hoque et al. (2015), where the respondents found to adopt e-

                       commerce for its usefulness.


                              According to Kaemingk (2020), like it or not, in the confusing and busy world of

                       online  shopping,  people  want  reassurance  before  committing  to  a  purchase.  Your

                       potential customers are turning to online review sites to learn all about your service or

                       product. Sites like Yelp, Google Maps, and TripAdvisor allow customers to give advice

                       or to read past customer experiences directly from the source. How powerful is this


                       route to market on customer buying decisions? The answer is very. 91% of 18-34-

                       year-olds trust online reviews as much as personal recommendations, and 93% of

                       consumers say that online reviews influence their purchase decisions.

                              Online reviews give power to the customers to tell their side of the buying story.

                       This provides social proof to other potential customers. Social proof is the level of

                       credibility that the public offers to a service or product. The more people who use or

                       enjoy a product, the more likely others are to follow. Positive public endorsement of a]]></page><page Index="118"><![CDATA[22


                       brand by a celebrity can provide high social proof, directly impacting sales. Likewise,

                       a negative review can drive customers away. There’s also evidence to suggest that

                       online  reviews  are  the  primary  way  to  choose  where  to  shop  locally.  Nearly  all

                       consumers (97%) now use online media when researching products or services in their


                       local area.

                       Spending Habits

                              According to Bump (2021), most consumers were more conscientious about

                       purchases  than  before  the  pandemic.  Because  of  this,  most  households  primarily

                       budgeted  around  essential  products  and  services.  As  businesses  and  economies


                       closed down due to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, consumers also tightened up

                       their budgets. When someone is on a tight budget, each dollar they spend has to be

                       worth  it. This means that the  products  or  services  they  buy  have  to  help  them  do

                       something essential, solve a common pain point, save them time or money, or fulfill

                       other major needs.

                              Consumers  sometimes  see  low  prices  as  simply  good  deals.  Shoppers’

                       perceptions of a low price depend on what they’re thinking about when deciding to buy


                       a product. Younger generations are also more likely to be price conscious and to price

                       compare, as over half of those two age segments report they are annoyed when they

                       can find products they want for lower prices elsewhere. While 18-29 year olds and 30-

                       44 year olds are fairly aligned on getting products at lower prices and getting irrelevant

                       offers, the 30-44 year old group is not nearly as sold on finding the best price at the


                       expense of finding unique products (Baird, 2019).

                              According  to  Glover  (2021),  many  best  practices  and  marketing  tactics

                       encourage natural word of mouth, but campaigns — particularly on social media —

                       can have the explicit aim of promoting an online business’ social exposure. 92 percent

                       Factors that Influence Buying Behavior


                          Consumer behavior is influenced by many different factors. A marketer should try

                       to understand the factors that influence consumer behavior.

                          Psychological factors. Human psychology is a major determinant of consumer

                       behavior. These factors are difficult to measure but are powerful enough to influence

                       a buying decision. Some of the important psychological factors are:


                          Motivation. When a person is motivated enough, it influences the buying behavior

                       of  the  person.  A  person  has  many  needs  such  as  the  social  needs,  basic  needs,

                       security needs, esteem needs and self-actualization needs. Out of all these needs, the

                       basic needs and security needs take a position above all other needs. Hence basic

                       needs and security needs have the power to motivate a consumer to buy products and

                       services.

                          Perception.  Consumer  perception is  a  major  factor  that  influences  consumer


                       behavior. It is a process where a customer collects information about a product and

                       interprets the information to make a meaningful image about a particular product.

                          When  a  customer  sees  advertisements,  promotions,  customer  reviews,  social

                       media feedback relating to a product, they develop an impression about the product.

                       Hence  consumer  perception  becomes  a  great  influence  on  the  buying  decision  of


                       consumers.

                          Learning. When a person buys a product, he/she gets to learn something more

                       about  the  product.  Learning  comes  over  a  period  of  time  through  experience.  A

                       consumer’s learning depends on skills and knowledge. While a skill can be gained

                       through practice, knowledge can be acquired only through experience.]]></page><page Index="120"><![CDATA[24


                          Attitudes  and  beliefs.  Consumers  have  certain  attitude  and  beliefs  which

                       influence the buying decisions of a consumer. Based on this attitude, the consumer

                       behaves in a particular way towards a product.

                          Social factors. Humans are social beings and they live around many people who


                       influence their buying behavior. Human try to imitate other humans and also wish to

                       be socially accepted in the society. Hence their buying behavior is influenced by other

                       people around them. These factors are considered as social factors. Some of the social

                       factors are:

                          Family. Family plays a significant role in shaping the buying behavior of a person.


                       A person develops preferences from his childhood by watching family buy products

                       and continues to buy the same products even when they grow up.

                          Reference groups. Reference group is a group of people with whom a person

                       associates  himself. Generally,  all  the  people  in the  reference group  have  common

                       buying behavior and influence each other.

                          Roles and status.  A person is influenced by the role that he holds in the society.

                       If a person is in a high position, his buying behavior will be influenced largely by his


                       status.

                          Cultural  factors.  A  group  of  people  are  associated  with  a  set  of  values  and

                       ideologies  that  belong  to  a  particular  community.  When  a  person  comes  from  a

                       particular community, his/her behavior is highly influenced by the culture relating to

                       that particular community. Some of the cultural factors are:


                          Culture.  Cultural  factors  have  strong  influence  on  consumer  buyer

                       behavior.   Cultural  factors  include  the  basic  values,  needs,  wants,  preferences,

                       perceptions, and behaviors that are observed and learned by a consumer from their

                       near family members and other important people around them.

                          Subculture.  Within  a  cultural  group,  there  exists  many  subcultures.  These

                       subcultural groups share the same set of beliefs and values. Subcultures can consist]]></page><page Index="121"><![CDATA[25


                       of  people  from  different  religion,  caste,  geographies  and  nationalities.  These

                       subcultures by itself form a customer segment.

                          Social class. Each and every society across the globe has form of social class.

                       The social class is not just determined by the income, but also other factors such as


                       the occupation, family background, education, and residence location. Social class is

                       important to predict the consumer behavior.

                          Personal  factors.  Factors  that  are  personal  to  the  consumers  influence  their

                       buying  behavior.  These  personal  factors  differ  from  person  to  person,  thereby

                       producing different perceptions and consumer behavior. Some of the personal factors


                       are:

                          Age. Age is a major factor that influences buying behavior. The buying choices of

                       youth differ from that of middle-aged people. Elderly people have a totally different

                       buying  behavior.  Teenagers  will  be  more  interested  in  buying  colorful  clothes  and

                       beauty  products.  Middle-aged  are  focused  on  house,  property  and  vehicle  for  the

                       family.

                          Income. Income has the ability to influence the buying behavior of a person. Higher


                       income gives higher purchasing power to consumers. When a consumer has higher

                       disposable income, it gives more opportunity for the consumer to spend on luxurious

                       products. Whereas  low-income  or  middle-income  group  consumers  spend  most  of

                       their income on basic needs such as groceries and clothes.

                          Occupation. Occupation of a consumer influences the buying behavior. A person


                       tends to buy things that are appropriate to this/her profession. For example, a doctor

                       would buy clothes according to this profession while a professor will have different

                       buying pattern.

                          Lifestyle.  Lifestyle  is  an  attitude,  and  a  way  in  which  an  individual  stay  in  the

                       society. The buying behavior is highly influenced by the lifestyle of a consumer. For

                       example when a consumer leads a healthy lifestyle, then the products he buys will

                       relate to healthy alternatives to junk food.]]></page><page Index="122"><![CDATA[26


                          Economic factors. The consumer buying habits and decisions greatly depend on

                       the economic situation of a country or a market. It bear a significant influence on the

                       buying decision of a consumer. Some of the important economic factors are:

                          Personal income. When a person has a higher disposable income, the purchasing


                       power increases simultaneously. Disposable income refers to the money

                          Family income. Family income is the total income from all the members of a family.

                       When  more  people  are  earning  in  the  family,  there  is  more  income  available  for

                       shopping basic needs and luxuries. Higher family income influences the people in the

                       family  to  buy  more.  When  there  is  a  surplus  income  available  for  the  family,  the


                       tendency is to buy more luxury items which otherwise a person might not have been

                       able to buy.

                          Consumer credit. When a consumer is offered easy credit to purchase goods, it

                       promotes higher spending. Sellers are making it easy for the consumers to avail credit

                       in the form of credit cards, easy installments, bank loans, hire purchase, and many

                       such  other  credit  options. When  there  is  higher  credit  available  to  consumers,  the

                       purchase of comfort and luxury items increases.


                          Liquid assets. Consumers who have liquid assets tend to spend more on comfort

                       and luxuries. Liquid assets are those assets, which can be converted into cash very

                       easily. Cash in hand, bank savings and securities are some examples of liquid assets.

                       When a consumer has higher liquid assets, it gives him more confidence to buy luxury

                       goods.


                          Savings. A consumer is highly influenced by the amount of savings he/she wishes

                       to set aside from his income. If a consumer decided to save more, then his expenditure

                       on buying reduces. Whereas if a consumer is interested in saving more, then most of

                       his income will go towards buying products. (Clootrack, 2021).

                              According to the study of Vidyapeetham (2018), it was identified that the five

                       factors, quality product, product price, brand name, product packaging and advertising

                       have greater impact on customer buying decision. Consumers go through the rigorous]]></page><page Index="123"><![CDATA[27

                       quality and price are one among the strong competing factors in the decision making

                       factors play a major role in consumer buying decision. Manufacturers and retailers of

                       beauty products must have this thought at the back of their mind as they embark on

                       the marketing of their products (Flores & Castaño 2020).

                       Synthesis of Related Literature and Studies

                              According to Clootrack (2021), a consumer's buying decision depends on the


                       types of products that they need to buy. The behavior of a consumer while buying a

                       coffee is a lot different from while purchasing a car. Meanwhile, learning the personality

                       type is important for marketers in designing shopping services that are attractive to

                       each type (Bajaj, 2018; Teoderescu et al., 2008).

                              Because  of  the  pandemic,  Filipinos  have  increased  their  shopping  online

                       (Campos,  n.d.  as  cited  by  Masigan,  2020;  Global Web,  2020;  Statistica  Research

                       Department, 2021). This sudden change engaged the researchers to study consumers'


                       buying behavior and personality type when buying online.

                              In terms of demographics, 72 percent of Filipino online shoppers are female,

                       while 28 percent are male. Age-wise, 45 percent are between 25 to 35 years old, 22

                       percent are between 18 to 24 years old, 16 percent are between 35 to 44 years old,

                       and 17 percent are 45 years old or older (Masigan, 2018). This became the basis of


                       the sampling technique used by the researchers as they divided their sample according

                       to the age/generation they belonged to. They also wanted to determine if there is a

                       significant  difference  in  the  personality  type  and  buying  behavior  in  terms  of  their

                       demographic profile.]]></page><page Index="124"><![CDATA[28



                                                       METHODOLOGY



                              This chapter presents the research design and the sampling techniques used

                       in  selecting  the  participants  of  the  study.  It  also  presents  the  data  gathering


                       procedures, the data analysis and the statistical treatment to be employed to achieve

                       the objectives of the study.

                       Research Design

                              The study used descriptive design. The study focused mainly on describing the

                       online shoppers’ personality types and their buying behavior.


                       Participants of the Study

                               The participants of the study are online shoppers. The data were gathered

                       from the responses of the participants in Cavite.

                       Sampling Technique

                              The  researchers  used  the  quota  sampling  technique.  A  questionnaire  was

                       developed to be used in this study. It is a structured questionnaire made up of several

                       statements which will determine the online shoppers in Cavite. Two hundred (200)


                       online  shoppers  answered  the  questionnaire.  Before  the  actual  distribution  of  the

                       instrument, the developed questionnaire was pre-tested on online shoppers in Cavite.

                       They were not part of the study to determine its validity and reliability. Once the validity

                       and reliability were established, this was sent to the selected online shoppers in Cavite,

                       wherein  35  percent  are  18-24  years  old,  50  percent  are  25-40  years  old,  and  15


                       percent are 41-56 years old. Simultaneously, each participant was contacted through

                       any communication forms available such as, but not limited to, texts, social media sites,

                       and emails.

                       Data Gathered

                              A  survey  questionnaire  was  developed  to  describe  the  online  shopper's

                       typology when buying online.]]></page><page Index="125"><![CDATA[29


                              Demographic  profile.  The  study  determined  the  participants'  demographic

                       profile, such as age, sex, occupation, and monthly income.

                                  The online shopping personality type of consumers. The study looked into

                       the  different  personalities  of  buyers  when  purchasing  online.  This  section  of  the


                       research provided data to determine their online shopping personality.

                                  The type of buying behavior of online shoppers. The research work is aimed

                       at the different types of purchases made by online buyers. This helped identify the

                       purchasing habits of internet shoppers.

                       Statistical Treatment of Data


                              To analyze the data in terms of online shoppers' personality and the types of

                       their  buying  behavior,  it  used  a  set  of  statements  to  obtain  participant's  degree  of

                       agreement  where they would  check five  if they  strongly  agreed;  4 for agree;  3 for

                       neither agree or disagree; 2 disagree; and 1 for strongly disagree.

                              Demographic profiles of the participants were collected in terms of descriptive

                       statistics-frequency counts and ratings.

                               A conversion table using the Likert scale was used to determine the online


                       shopping  personality  types  and  consumers'  buying  behavior.  It  was  also  used  to

                       measure the online shopping personality types and type of buying behavior.

                              The survey questionnaire was evaluated for validity and reliability before data

                       analysis using Cronbach's alpha analysis. Data were analyzed using statistical tools

                       such as frequency counts, percentage, means, and standard deviation to describe the


                       demographic  profile,  online  shopping  personality  types,  and  consumers'  buying

                       behavior.

                              F-statistics or F-value was used in presenting the test of the difference between

                       their personality types and type of buying behavior when grouped according to age,

                       sex, employment status, and monthly income.]]></page><page Index="126"><![CDATA[30


                              P-value was also used to determine whether there was a significant difference

                       or no significant difference. If it is less than or equal to 0.05, there is a significant

                       difference, but there is no significant difference if it is greater than 0.05.

                              Furthermore,  the  T-statistics  or  T-value  was  used  to  present  the  test  of


                       difference in their personality types and type of buying behavior grouped according to

                       their  demographic  characteristics.  Demographic  profiles  of  the  participants  were

                       collected in terms of descriptive statistics-frequency counts and ratings. A conversion

                       table using a Likert scale was used to determine the online shopping personality types

                       and consumers' buying behavior. It was also used to measure the online shopping


                       personality types and type of buying behavior.

                                                 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION




                              This  chapter  presents  the  findings  of  the  data  as  a  result  of  the  survey


                       conducted. It also presents pertinent information regarding the problem under study.

                       Reliability Analysis

                              The developed questionnaire was administered to 50 participants, who were

                       not  included  in  the  study,  to  determine  its  internal  consistency  before  it  was

                       administered to the actual participants. Chronbach’s analysis was used to assess the

                       constructs reliability.

                              Table  2  presents  the  Cronbachʼs  alpha  reliability  coefficients  of  the  scales


                       under study after accounting for the reversely-worked items. Generally, the minimum

                       acceptable requirements of Cronbachʼs alpha coefficient should be greater than 0.70

                       (Hair 1998; George & Mallery, 2003) to achieve internal consistency among the test

                       items

                              The Cronbachʼs alpha reliability coefficients of each scales was greater than


                       0.70. Therefore, the Cronbach’s alpha reliability coefficients for the online shopping

                       personality  types  and  types  of  buying  behavior  reveal  good  to  high  internal

                       consistency.]]></page><page Index="128"><![CDATA[32

                       questionnaires that were distributed to them. The data included age, sex, civil status,

                       and monthly income.

                              Table 4 shows that most of the participants (50%) belonged to the age bracket

                       of 25-40 years old and were female (68.50%). Mostly, (89.50%) of the participants are

                       employed (47.50%) and have monthly income ranging from Php 10,000 and below.

                         Millennials prefer online shopping because it is more convenient in shipping, delivery,


                       and price comparison. It allows them to shop from the comfort of their own home or

                       office. Women are more enthusiastic about e-commerce and online shopping than

                       men,  who  prefer  to  shop  in  physical  stores  (Columbus,  2020). The majority  of  the

                       participants have a job and a steady income that makes it possible to purchase a

                       product through online shopping.]]></page><page Index="129"><![CDATA[33

                       The lowest weighted mean of 3.33 is they don’t trust Internet retailers, so they are not

                       buying from them. As a result, the study revealed that consumers agree that they are

                       shopping avoiders because buyers lack trust in online shops and incapability to shop

                       online, so retailers will not be able to overcome this readily.


                                  According to Sterling (2020), people do not shop online because they cannot

                       assess the product before they purchase them. Some people would like to check for

                       good  quality  and  perfect  performance  of  the  items  they  require  before  purchasing

                                  According to Daroch (2021), buyers are hesitant due to fear of online theft of

                       family before deciding to buy. The overall result of complex buying behavior weighted

                       mean of 4.74 was interpreted as strongly agree, which means that the consumer is

                       highly involved in the purchase decision. The consumer will research thoroughly before

                       buying products. This implies that online reviews give power to the customers to tell


                       their side of the buying story. This provides social proof to other potential customers.

                       Reading reviews or suggestions before purchasing a product will help customers to

                       get a good quality product to be satisfied with what they buy (Kaeming, 2020).

                              Table 15 shows the overall results of the types of buying behavior of consumers

                       strongly agree and had the highest weighted mean among the others. As a result,

                       complex  buying  behavior  is  the  majority  buying  behavior  of  the  participants.

                       Consumers  are  highly  involved  in  purchasing  decisions  and  thoroughly  research

                       before  buying  products.  Shopping  online  is  risky  because  the  consumer  will  pass


                       through  a  learning  process.  They  will  first  develop  beliefs  about  the  product,  then

                       attitudes, and make a thoughtful purchase choice. While the variety-seeking behavior

                       age. It can be said that a business user's personality type has a significant difference

                       in  terms  of  age.  This  means  that  the  business  user's  personality  type  may  differ

                       according  to  age.  Others  such  as  adventurous,  shopping  lovers,  fearful,  shopping

                       avoiders, and fun-seekers have no significant difference when grouped according to


                       age. This means that the personality of a business user varies with age because being

                       an entrepreneur is dependent on the person who holds it. Anyone can enter this field,

                              Table 17 shows the difference in buying behavior when grouped according to

                       age. It can be shown that there is a highly significant difference between complex

                       buying behavior and a significant difference in variety-seeking buying behavior. Others

                       such  as  dissonance-reducing  and  habitual  have  no  significant  difference  when


                       grouped according to age.

                              This implies that complex buying behavior and variety-seeking behavior have

                       a  significant  age  difference.  According  to  Clootrack  (2021),  age  is  a  major  factor

                       influencing buying behavior. The buying choices of youth differ from that of middle-

                       aged people. Elderly people have different buying behavior. Teenagers will be more


                       interested in buying colorful clothes and beauty products. Middle-aged is focused on

                       house, property, and vehicle for the family.

                       stronger effect on females than males pursuing entrepreneurial activities. Women are

                       earned profit (Bouhnik, 2018). In addition, fearful browsers based on sex have different

                       perspectives on online buying. For example, women prefer to buy what they will use


                       online, whereas men prefer to see the product before purchasing.

                       Meanwhile,  there  is  a  highly  significant  difference  in  complex  buying  behavior

                       according  to  age.  The  null  hypothesis  formulated  was  that  there  is  no  significant

                       demographic  profile  were  rejected  because  some  personality  types  and  buying

                                    SUMMARY, CONCLUSION, AND RECOMMENDATION



                              This chapter presents the summary of the study, the conclusion drawn and the

                       recommendations made regarding to the online shopping personality types and type


                       of buying behavior of consumers in Cavite.

                       Summary

                              This study was conducted to determine the online shopping personality types

                       and consumers' buying behavior in Cavite. Specifically, the study aimed to determine

                       the demographic profiles of the participants; describe the online shopping personality


                       type of consumers; identify the type of buying behavior of online shoppers; determine

                       if there is a significant difference between their personality type and buying behavior

                       when grouped according to their demographic characteristics.

                              The study followed a descriptive design. It was used to describe the online

                       shopping personality types of consumers. It was also used to identify online shoppers'

                       buying  behavior  and  determine  if  there  is  a  significant  difference  between  their

                       personality type and buying behavior when grouped according to their demographic


                       characteristics. Furthermore, the researchers used quota sampling to determine the

                       number of participants.

                                  The  data  were  gathered  using  self-administered  survey  questionnaires  that

                       were distributed to 200 participants' online shoppers in Cavite.

                                  The researcher gathered data from September to December 2021. As a result,


                       most  of the  participants  belonged  to the  age  bracket  of  25-40  years  old  and  were

                       female. Also, most of them were employed and had a monthly income ranging from

                       10,000 and below.

                              Furthermore, researchers gathered data that online shopping personality types

                       are  shopping  lovers  and  fun-seekers,  and  consumers'  buying  behavior  is  complex

                       buying behavior, dissonance-reducing behavior, and habitual buying behavior. Based

                       on the result, there is a significant difference between online shopping personality type,]]></page><page Index="148"><![CDATA[52


                       which is business users, in terms of age, sex, and monthly income. Meanwhile, there

                       is a significant difference between buying behavior in age and employment status.

                       Conclusion

                              After the analysis of the results, the following conclusion were drawn:


                              1.  Most of the participants belonged to the age bracket of 25-40 years old and

                                 were female. Also, most of them were employed and had monthly incomes

                                 ranging from 10,000 and below.

                              2.  It is shown in the results that online shoppers are fun-seekers and shopping

                                 lovers. Most of the participants strongly agree that they are fun-seekers


                                 because they see the entertainment value in the online shop but are careful

                                 when buying the product and shopping lovers result as they enjoy shopping

                                 online with no regrets.

                              3.  The type of buying behavior of online shoppers is complex buying behavior.

                                 This means that the consumer is highly involved in the purchase decision,

                                 and the consumer will research thoroughly before buying products. They

                                 also strongly agree that dissonance-reducing buying behavior means that


                                 consumers buy a readily available product and will be forced to buy goods

                                 that  do  not  have  many  choices.  Therefore,  consumers  will  be  left  with

                                 limited decision-making. Lastly, they strongly agree that they have habitual

                                 buying behavior, which means that the consumer is buying products that

                                 they use for their daily routine, and they do not put a lot of thought into the


                                 product. They tend to buy products that are familiar to them.

                              4.  There is a significant difference between business user personality types in

                                 terms of age, sex, and monthly income, while fearful browsers' personality

                                 types have significant differences according to sex. There is a significant

                                 difference  between  the  participants  in  variety-seeking  behavior  when

                                 grouped  according  to  age  and  employment  status  in  terms  of  buying]]></page><page Index="149"><![CDATA[53


                                 behavior.  Meanwhile,  there  is  a  highly  significant  difference  in  complex

                                 buying behavior according to age.

                       Recommendations

                              The researcher further recommends the following:


                              1.  Online retailers should ensure that their online shopping process through

                                 their website is easy, simple, convenient, and secure for consumers. They

                                 should also build a secure platform to prevent cyber hacking, especially for

                                 customers who are hesitant to buy online because of security issues.

                              2.  This  study  provides  a  foundation  for  future  researchers  in  studying


                                 consumer behavior and types of online shoppers. Further research can be

                                 possible by increasing the sample size, including a rural population that

                                 may reflect the entire scenario of consumer behavior of online shopping in

                                 Cavite.  Furthermore,  the  variables  identified  in  this  study  may  not  be

                                 sufficient,  and  more  variables  are  to  be  considered  in  future  research.

                                 Researchers may also look for factors that influence the online shopping

                                 personality types and types of buying behavior.


                              3.  These findings may provide online business entrepreneurs with pertinent

                                 information to create and plan marketing strategies that are in line with the

                                 online shopping behavior of the consumer considering online shopping is

                                 the most popular online activity. To build consumer trust or loyalty, online

                                 store sites are advised to make useful features such as price comparison


                                 features,  make  online  shop  sites  user-friendly  and  provide  the  latest

                                 information, because the utility of online shop sites will foster trust in the

                                 minds of consumers.

                              4.  The online business should drive clients to pay more attention to product or

                                 service  information  research,  promote  the  products  for  customer

                                 awareness, and then increase the online shopping experience to boost the

                                 online shopper’s acceptance, trust, and loyalty.]]></page><page Index="150"><![CDATA[54

                                                    EXECUTIVE SUMMARY






                       CD-R  King  is  one  of  the  first  retail  chain  to  offer  electronic  accessories  in  the

                       Philippines at an affordable price aiming for every customer’s satisfaction. Through

                       direct selling, CC-R King made sure that end users are satisfied and have their best


                       experience in buying their product. Generally, CD-R King’s ultimate way of capturing

                       customers to gain in the competitive market is to offer all sorts of goods that meet and

                       satisfy the very needs of the customers at an affordable price.

                       This strategic plan is going to take a closer look into CD-R King as a company and

                       how to regain the market share and market position it once has. This plan will also

                       discuss the company’s history, the products, and the services they offer, and how the


                       company operates and sets goals. CD-R King has a vision and a mission statement

                       that is of high importance to them. An external and internal assessment is also going

                       to be done in this strategic plan, along with  corporate and business level strategic

                       analysis,  strategy  implementation,  strategy  evaluation  and  control,  and  looking  at

                       some of CD-R King’s competitors and their financial outlook for the future.]]></page><page Index="186"><![CDATA[2



                                                        INTRODUCTION



                       In 1997, CD-R King opened its first store in Quiapo, Manila. Nicholson Santos and

                       Henry Ngo, according to records, formed the firm. The original CD-R King was a small

                       store along Paterno Street that sold CD-Rs (recordable CDs) when they became the

                       most preferred mode of data storage. After the first location closed, CD-R King began


                       opening sites near colleges and universities, a strategic step to get closer to its target

                       market  of  students  and  educators.  CD-R  King  does  not  make  their  own  products;

                       instead,  they  import  them  from  different  suppliers  in  Taiwan,  China,  and  other

                       countries. CD-R King has built a variety of brands such as Stark, Kenko World, Mobile

                       King, and California Eco-BIKE.

                       Initially, CD-R King sold CD-Rs or recordable CDs back when it was the preferred


                       mode of data storage yet due to the growing demands for newer technologies, they

                       began to diversify their merchandise. Following the release of CD-Rs and CD-RWs

                       (CD-Rewritable),  the  company  expanded  into  the  sale  of  computer  parts,

                       smartphones,  audio  and  video  equipment,  car  accessories,  LED  lights,  and  home

                       appliances. Among the items in the company's portfolio are optical storage media,

                       cellular phones, routers, accessories, mobile gadgets, appliances, switches, electrical


                       bicycles, and a variety of others. These merchandises can be availed in a discounted

                       price which results for the brand to monopolize the market for inexpensive computer

                       parts and electronics (Caῆa, P. 2020, November 11).

                       The generic marketing approach of CD-R King emphasizes low-cost and inexpensive

                       goods. Its low-cost product is one of its competitive advantages, and it is also a factor

                       in  capturing  the  market,  especially  among  price-sensitive  customers.  Furthermore,

                       CD-R King widened its product line, which is not limited to a single category, in the way


                       that it keeps Filipinos up to date with the new IT gadgets. This is the brand where the

                       customer  goes  for  inexpensive  PC  parts,  accessories,  and  portable  disc  drives,]]></page><page Index="187"><![CDATA[3


                       memory  cards,  and  so  forth.  Meanwhile,  In  the  early  to  mid-2000s,  CD-R  King

                       expanded rapidly, opening branches in most large shopping malls such as SM and

                       Robinsons, as well as so-called higher-end malls such as the Podium. According to

                       the Game Changer feature, CD-R King had about 350 branches by 2016. They had


                       branches  in  nearly  every  major  city,  including  in  provinces  like  Baguio,  Batangas,

                       Laguna,  Rizal,  Cebu  and  as  far  away  as  Ozamiz  City.  All  of  them  were  company

                       owned. Another strategy that CD-R King use is through ecommerce. Their products

                       are currently available in different online selling platforms such as Lazada, and their

                       official website which unfortunately, is still in its beta version (Caῆa, P. 2020, November


                       11).

                       Once hailed as the king of electronic retailers, CD-R King is now in the verge of shutting

                       down. Factors such as the increasing popularity of e-commerce, the emergence of

                       other  competitors  with  similar  themes  and  products,  copyright  concerns,  and  the

                       unceasing unfavorable reviews about their products and services contributes to its

                       possible downfall.  In early 2000s, inexpensive electronic merchandise was hard to be

                       availed making it possible for CD-R king to monopolize the market for inexpensive


                       computer parts and electronics. However, nowadays, these products can be availed

                       through competitors such as Miniso, Mumuso, and similarly themed mini-department

                       stores  and  even  through  various  e-commerce  platforms  that  offers  wide  variety  of

                       options. CD-R King has also an outdated payment system wherein they manually write

                       the receipt for every transaction resulting to longer queuing time. This is a drawback


                       since customers at present value their time and detest waiting. Furthermore, because

                       CD-R King items are known for being inexpensive, it logically follows that the quality is

                       below par resulting to the brands’ reputation to be questioned. Although CD-R King

                       already  ventured  into  e-commerce,  their  posted  product  in  Lazada  gets  negative

                       reviews. It is only a matter of time before CD-R King loses its throne if its management

                       fails to review or change their business strategies. It is essential for every business to

                       revise and update their strategic plan when needed in order to adapt to changes inside]]></page><page Index="188"><![CDATA[4


                       and outside the business organization as well as to ensure that the plan is still aligned

                       with the institution's priorities.






                                                      STRATEGIC FOCUS




                       I. Vision Statement

                       “Our Vision is to provide every Filipino with the latest technology at an affordable price.”

                              A. Characteristic of Vision Statement


                                 a.  Possibility

                                     It  entails  innovative  possibility  for  a  dramatic  organizational

                                     improvement which is evident in the mention of a plan to provide latest

                                     technology at an affordable price.

                                 b.  Desirability

                                     It defines a broad aim that directly addresses organizational members.

                                     The ultimate aim paints a vision of the business's future, which in this


                                     case  is  an  organization  that  provides  the  latest  technology  to  every

                                     Filipino at a reasonable price.

                                 c.  Actionability

                                     It is concise and well-communicated, which aids in getting the proper

                                     things done in the organization. Getting the correct thing done improves


                                     organizational  efficiency  and  effectiveness.  Because  organizational

                                     members understand the organizational purpose and objectives, having

                                     a clear vision of what an organization may be in the future helps them

                                     establish priorities.]]></page><page Index="189"><![CDATA[5


                                 d.  Articulation

                                     CD-R King's Vision Statement effectively provides a long-term roadmap

                                     while still defining the kind of business it aspires to be and instilling a

                                     sense of purposeful action in the company.


                          B. Strengths and Weaknesses of Company Vision Statement

                                 a.  Strength: The Vision Statement of CD-R King clearly defines the vision

                                     of the company for the future. It is brief and succinct, it clarifies the

                                     organization's long-term goals and objectives, not too generic and too

                                     specific, and finally, it gives emphasize to what the company is all about


                                     and what it wishes to become.

                                 b.  Weaknesses: The desired size and sphere of influence of CD-R King

                                     as shown in the Vision Statement is limited to local market or within

                                     Philippines  only  which  eliminates the  possibility of  global  expansion.

                                     Furthermore, it easily fit any company or organization making it non-

                                     unique.

                              C. Proposed Changes in the Vision Statement


                              “Our Vision is to be the leading provider of latest technology at an affordable

                              price on a global level.”

                       II. Mission Statement

                       “Our mission is to be the No. 1 top media & technology provider in the Philippines that

                       could provide the latest technology at an affordable price without extra cost and also


                       to be able to deliver up-to-date technologies to the Philippine market with the latest

                       computer related products as well as computer accessories."

                              A.  Components of Mission Statement

                                         the employee’s well-being.

                                 CD-R King's Mission Statement has the quality of being broad, but not too

                                 general, since it is not too vague nor too narrow in terms of the specifics it

                                 entails.  It  also  represents  the  firm's  value  because  it  emphasizes  the

                                 affordable  latest  computer  related  products  as  well  as  computer

                                 accessories.  It  is  also  Enduring  because  it  continues  to  direct  and

                                 for guidance since it acts as a direction or roadmap for meeting the firm's

                              C.  Evaluation of Mission Statement

                                 The  Mission  Statement  of  CD-R  King  is  transparent  and  intuitive  to  all

                                 parties concerned. It also has a primary emphasis on a single strategic

                                 thrust,  which  is  to  provide  the  latest  computer-related  technology  and


                                 accessories at a reasonable price. It also reflects the organization's distinct

                                 competence, which is its cost benefit over rivals. It is also broad enough to

                                 allow  flexibility  in  implementation,  but  not  so  broad  as  to  permit  lack  of

                                 focus. It also serves as a template and be the same means by which the

                                 organization can make decisions. Finally, it reflects attainable goals.


                              D. Strengths and Weaknesses of Mission Statement

                                 a.  Strength: The mission statement of CD-R King presents the company’s

                                     purpose, goals, its primary customers or market, its geographical region

                                     of operation, and the kind of product it offers in a concise and simple

                                     declaration.

                                 b.  Weaknesses: The firm failed to include the quality of the products they

                                     offer as well as their concern for improvement of quality of work life,


                                     equal opportunity for all, measures for employee welfare etc.

                              E. Proposed Changes in the Mission Statement

                              “Our  mission  is  to  be  the  No.  1  top  media  &  technology  provider  in  the

                              Philippines that could provide high quality latest computer related products as

                              well as computer accessories at an affordable price without extra cost and also


                              provide  employees  with  on-going  training  and  offer  opportunities  for

                              advancement.”]]></page><page Index="192"><![CDATA[8

                          B.  Industry Boundaries

                              Boundaries to entry are specific to each part of the sector. These boundaries

                              make it costly or cumbersome for new firms to enter the market and help shield

                              established firms from competition. The presence of these boundaries and the


                              resulting lack of competition enable established firms to set higher prices, which

                              limits demand. Boundaries can protect such as:

                              a. Market share

                              b. Patent Protections

                              e. High customer switching cost

                          C.  Industry Environment

                              The electronics sector is growing rapidly as a result of increasing demand from

                              emerging  market  economies.  As  a  result,  many  countries  are  increasingly

                              producing  more  electronics,  and  investment  in  the  foreign  production  of

                              electronics  has  increased  dramatically.  Electronics  sector  growth  is


                              accelerated by increased consumer spending around the world. As developing

                              economies grow, consumer demand for electronics also grows. Countries that

                              produce  electronics  now  have  strong  consumer  bases  that  can  afford  new

                              electronic products. At the same time, increased competition is driving the costs

                              of electronics production down, making products even cheaper for individuals.


                              Electronics  retail,  however,  is  becoming  increasingly  competitive  and

                              fragmented from experiencing a unique set of challenges. Many electronics

                              brands  are  now  offering  their  products  at  their  own  stores  as  a  means  of

                              becoming more profitable. These stores compete with flagship retailers, such

                              as  Best  Buy  (BBY),  for  customer  traffic.  Though  the  electronics  sector  is

                              growing,  primarily  the  semiconductor  industry,  due  to  increased  consumer

                              spending in emerging markets, the sector continues to become fragmented and]]></page><page Index="197"><![CDATA[13


                              competitive as the landscape changes, new technologies are introduced, and

                              new  entrants  enter  the  market.  As  a  result,  the  stock  prices  of  electronics

                              companies are likely to experience some volatility.

                          D.  Industry Structure


                              Globalization  in  the  electronics  industry  combines  a  massive,  yet  highly

                              concentrated,  international  dispersion  of  the  value  chain  with  an  important

                              organizational  innovation,  the  spread  of  global  production  networks  (GPN).

                              These  networks  are  a  response  to  the  flagship’s  increasingly  pervasive

                              outsourcing  requirements  and  the  demanding  coordination  requirements  of


                              geographic  dispersion:  they  integrate  the  dispersed  supply  and  customer

                              Acer or Samsung). The main purpose is to gain quick access to lower-cost

                              foreign  capabilities  that  are  complementary  to  the  flagship’s  own

                              competencies.  The  creation  of GPN reflects  increasing  pressures  to  exploit

                              complementarities that result from the interactive nature of knowledge creation.

                              that enables global brand-name companies to combine cost reduction, product

                              differentiation  and  time-to-market.  A  peculiar  feature  of  this  new  model  of

                              industrial  organization  is  that  manufacturing  is  de-coupled  from  product

                              development, and is dispersed across firm and national boundaries.

                              The electronics sector includes consumer electronics, specialized electronics

                              for other industries, and component parts such as semiconductors. Barriers to


                              entry are specific to each part of the sector. These barriers make it costly or

                              cumbersome for new firms to enter the market and help shield established firms]]></page><page Index="199"><![CDATA[15


                              from  competition.  The  presence  of  these  barriers  and  the  resulting  lack  of

                              competition enable established firms to set higher prices, which limits demand.

                              Common barriers to entry include economies of scale and scope, research and

                              development, capital-intensive production, switching costs, and brand loyalty.


                          F.  Industry performance

                                 •  Production

                              The  Philippine  semiconductors  and  electronics  industry  are  the  largest

                              contributor  to  the  country's  manufacturing  sector.  In  2013,  the  industry

                              accounted for 41% of total exports, brought in US$ 918 million-worth of foreign


                              and domestic investments, and employed 2.2 million workers.

                                 •  Sales

                              The  Philippine  Electronics  Industry  is  classified  into  73%  Semiconductor

                              Manufacturing Services (SMS) and 27% Electronics Manufacturing Services

                              (EMS). Most of the electronics businesses in the country operate in four key


                              areas:  Metro  Manila,  CALABARZON,  Northern/Central  Luzon  and  Cebu.

                              Electronic  companies  in  the  country  practice  the  best-known  methods  in

                              manufacturing with capabilities ranging from IC packaging, PCB Assembly and

                              Full Product Assembly.

                              Year-to-date (January  –  February)  data  of  2021  shows  that  PH  Electronics

                              Exports has a total value of US$ 6.8 billion. Moreover, 18.33% of the country’s

                              electronics  exports  goes  to  Hong  Kong,  followed  by  USA  (14.6%),  China


                              (11.37%), Japan (8.06%), and Singapore (6.9%) that completes the top five

                              exports destination of the electronics sector.

                                 •  Profitability

                              Philippine  consumer  electronics  market  spending  from  2020-2024  should

                              reach $8.1 billion and spending in 2020 alone should be around $6 billion. The


                              most popular subsectors would include mobile handsets, computer hardware,

                              and audio-visual devices. Many favorable factors have poised this industry for]]></page><page Index="200"><![CDATA[16


                              continued growth. The first would be that the Philippine economy has been

                              consistently growing for years and that 60% of its population is under 23 years

                              old.  A  new  middle  class  is  also  emerging,  and  an  estimated  1.5  million

                              households will reach an income of $25,000 by 2024. This group will purchase


                              consumer electronics for the first time, and is eager to own mobile devices,

                              televisions, and possibly computers.

                              The mobile device market is the largest, making up over 55% of all consumer

                              electronics related spending. About 44 million of the 100 million population own

                              smartphones, and a CNN report noted that Filipinos spent an average of 10


                              hours  online  a  day,  much  of  it  on  social  media.  Long  commute  times  and

                              computer-based work likely are significant contributors. Even for those who do

                              not have smartphones, mobile phones are a necessity and are used to send

                              and receive money for the unbanked population. Computer hardware sales will

                              increase  as  more  first-time  computer  owners  emerge.  The  phasing  out  of

                              Microsoft  7  (which  still  accounts  for  30%  browsing  traffic)  will  induce  new

                              purchases. The audio-visual segment will see growth with more users buying


                              their  first  flat-screen  televisions.  The  analog  switches  off  will  also  promote

                              further purchases.

                              The actual purchasing power for the nation as a whole is distorted by the $33

                              billion in remittances that enter the country. A unique challenge of the Philippine

                              market is over reliance on mobile devices. Due to the mobile device sector


                              being  so  strong,  there  is  limited  demand  for  other  consumer  electronic

                              products,  including  cameras,  printers,  computers,  and  gaming  consoles.  As

                              mobile devices can perform many functions, getting consumers to purchase

                              products  with  seemingly  redundant  features  will  be  more  challenging.

                              Differentiating  products  and  features  and  setting  appropriate  pricing  is

                              essential.]]></page><page Index="201"><![CDATA[17


                              The challenges in the Philippines include a lack of cell coverage due to limited

                              towers  and  the  slowest  Internet  in  Asia.  The  newly  formed  Department  of

                              Information and Communication Technology (DICT) Department is working to

                              address such challenges with a Broadband Plan, a new Common Tower Policy,


                              and the introduction of a third player in the telecom market. There is hope that

                              such reforms will improve infrastructure to enable more powerful utilization of

                              consumer electronics. Firms interested in entering the market would need to

                              find a local partner or distributor. Commercial Service Philippines can assist

                              with this process.


                                 •  Technology advancement

                              Philippines is not the world's least technologically advanced country; it is far

                              from  leading.  It  ranks  83rd  out  of  138  countries  in  terms  of  technological

                              readiness, according to the Department of Science and Technology (DOST).

                              The  Department  of  Science  and  Technology’s  (DOST)  established  the

                              Advanced Device and Materials Testing Laboratory (ADMATEL) to improve the


                              industry’s  current  capabilities.  The  facility  contains  equipment  for  failure

                              analysis  and  materials  characterization,  thereby  lessening  production  costs

                              and lead time for testing products abroad.

                              Moreover, the Philippine government and SEIPI are working to further develop

                              the industry’s labor force, including strengthening industry-academe linkages

                              through the promotion of more apprenticeship and immersion programs among


                              firms and training schools.

                          G.  Industry practices

                              Electronics  manufacturing  is  the  most  important  industry  of  the  Philippines.

                              Electronics  exports  from  the  Philippines  totaled  US$28.6  billion  in  2016,

                              accounting for more than 50% of the country’s exports. The industry has been

                              an  important  source  of  jobs  and  foreign  direct  investment,  attracting

                              multinational companies like Intel, Acer, Texas Instruments, and Toshiba to]]></page><page Index="202"><![CDATA[18


                              invest in the Philippines. Electronics manufacturing is one of the Philippines’

                              most  competitive  sectors,  its  global  competitiveness  has  declined  between

                              2000 and 2010, which is a cause of concern for the country. One of the major

                              reasons for this decline is the focus of the cluster on producing low value-added


                              intermediate components as opposed to high value-added finished products.

                              Labor productivity has also not improved significantly, and continues to lag the

                              level of other regional economies like Malaysia, Thailand, or Singapore

                                 •  Product Policy

                              Since  the  1970s,  electronic  &  electrical  (E&E)  equipment  have  figured


                              significantly in the Philippine economy and have remained the foundation of

                              the country’s exports until today. In 2014, the Philippines exports in E&E related

                              products  registered  US$29  billion,  87%  of  which  was  electronic,  and  13%

                              electrical. In the same year, these sectors accounted for 47% of total exports

                              from the Philippines. This export-oriented industry is characterized by large,

                              labor-intensive operations, which make it an important source of employment.


                              For instance, a total of 258 E&E firms operating out of the Philippines employ

                              about 344,450 workers. These firms also tend to be branch plants of foreign

                              MNCs. Additionally, E&E investments account for the majority of all FDIs in the

                              country. While the sector is strong locally, it is still a relatively small contributor

                              to the global industry, accounting for just one percent of global E&E exports in

                              2014. The Philippines participates primarily in the component stage of the value


                              chain, which accounts for over two-thirds of exports and firms. Within electronic

                              components,  integrated  circuits  -  particularly  A&T  activities  for  analog

                              semiconductors - are the main area.

                                 •  Pricing Policy

                              In the Philippines’ consumer electronics market, existing brands already have


                              a strong following and consumers are unlikely to pay a premium for a relatively

                              unknown brand. However, there is a strong demand for mid-priced and mass]]></page><page Index="203"><![CDATA[19


                              market products, especially among consumers in second and third tier cities

                              and younger consumers looking for good value for money gadgets. Hong Kong

                              companies are likely to find more opportunities by adopting a mass market or

                              mid end pricing strategy, as opposed to the sort of premium pricing strategy


                              that global brands such as Apple employ. In the case of smartphones, low price

                              products are priced below PHP5,000 (US$100), while premium priced ranges

                              such as Apple and Samsung cost at least PHP40,000 (US$790).

                              Hong  Kong  companies  targeting  the  Philippines  market  should  avoid

                              competing directly with incumbent brands that have already secured a strong


                              market share, and instead position themselves in certain market niches and

                              price their products according to that niche. Hong Kong SMEs should market

                              their products as being able to perform specific functions extremely well, rather

                              than  offering  a  full  package  of  features  and  competing  within  the  premium

                              market segment.

                              (DTI) - Export Marketing Bureau/Philippine Trade and Investment Center, will

                              spearhead the first-ever Philippine electronics business mission to France on

                              23-27 October 2018.


                              The  mission  aims  to  directly  promote  the  capabilities  of  the  Philippine

                              electronics sector to foreign partners through proactive business engagements

                              with  French  companies,  and  to  establish  partnerships  with  French  industry

                              promotion of Philippine electronic products and services. This is aligned with

                              the electronics industry’s roadmap called the Product and Technology Holistic

                              Strategy (PATHS), which identifies niche products and technologies that the

                              Philippines should be focusing on in the next five years.


                                 •  Distribution Policy

                              The production and manufacture of electronics products for export are among

                              the export activities listed in the IPP, specifically the production/manufacture of

                              non-traditional export products and with export requirement of at least 50% of

                              its output, if Filipino-owned, or at least 70%, if foreign-owned.


                          H.  Industry’s future prospects

                              The  Philippine  semiconductors  and  electronics  industry  are  the  largest

                              contributor  to  the  country's  manufacturing  sector.  In  2013,  the  industry

                              accounted for 41% of total exports, brought in US$ 918 million-worth of foreign

                              and domestic investments, and employed 2.2 million workers. The potential for

                              the industry remains high, as member firms intend to move to higher value-


                              added  manufacturing  to  meet  global  demand.  These  companies  plan  to

                              improve  current  production  capacities,  to  expand  current  research  and

                              development and design capabilities, and to further develop the labor force

                              over the next several years.

                              The  industry  is  working  to  drive  up  the  semiconductor  and  electronics

                              manufacturing index of the country by identifying customers' needs, understand


                              suppliers' baseline, develop relevant capabilities, match industry supply and

                              demand, and conduct periodic assessment of its performance. In addition, the

                              industry  recommends  that  the  government  continue  with  its  scholarship

                              program  for  operators  and  technicians,  improving  the  country's  business

                              environment,  conducting  R&D  capability  development,  and  aggressively

                              promoting local industries and SMEs through investment missions abroad.]]></page><page Index="205"><![CDATA[21

                              •  Political Factors

                                 The Philippines has a presidential system with the president being the head

                                 of state, the head of government, and the commander-in-chief of the armed

                                 forces. It is a unitary state; however, the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region

                                 in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) is mostly free from the control of the national

                                 government. The Philippines is an active member of the UN. It is also an

                                 active member of a number of prestigious organizations e.g., the East Asia


                                 Summit (EAS), the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), the World

                                 Bank, World Trade Organization (WTO), and the Group of 24. It has also

                                 put  efforts  in  place  to  obtain  the  observer  status  of  the  Organization  of

                                 Islamic  Cooperation  (OIC).  It  maintains  very  good  trade  and  diplomatic

                                 relations  with  China,  the  USA,  and  many  other  countries.  The  political

                                 environment  is  relatively  stable;  however,  nepotism,  controversial  anti-


                                 drugs campaigns, and extra-judicial killings of suspects in the Philippines

                                 have  drawn  a  lot  of  local  and  international  criticisms.  Though  the

                                 government has launched wars, corruption still remains a major problem in

                                 the country.

                              •  Economic Factors

                              The  COVID-19  pandemic  has constrained  economic  activity  not  only  in  the


                              Philippines, but across the globe. Nevertheless, we are seeing early signs of

                              recovery. The manufacturing purchasing managers index has risen to 49.9 in

                              November, close to the 50-point expansion threshold. At the same time, the

                              manufacturing  volume  of  production  index  has  also  improved.  The  gradual

                              easing of lockdown measures and promising developments regarding vaccines


                              have  contributed  to  improvements  in  business  operating  conditions.  Latest

                              surveys indicate improved optimism of businesses and consumers, however.]]></page><page Index="206"><![CDATA[22


                              The  overall  business  confidence  index  reverted  to  positive  territory  at  10.6

                              percent in Q4 from –5.3 percent in Q3. This optimism in the last quarter of 2020

                              was attributed to the reopening of businesses amid the "new normal," easing

                              of community quarantines nationwide, seasonal factors such as an uptick in


                              demand during the holiday season and the start of the milling season, and the

                              increase  in  volume  of  sales  and  orders.  Meanwhile,  the  overall  consumer

                              confidence  index  was  more  optimistic  at  –47.9  percent  in  Q4  from  –54.5

                              percent in Q3. The improved outlook during the current quarter was brought

                              about by expectations of more jobs and permanent employment; additional and


                              high income; effective government policies and programs such as the Social

                              Amelioration Program and the Plant, Plant, Plant Program; reduced community

                              restrictions, the reopening of businesses, and the expected end of the COVID-

                              19 pandemic when vaccines are made broadly available.

                              The DBCC, in consultation with the BSP, decided to retain the current inflation

                              target range for 2021 to 2022 at 2 to 4 percent and retain the same inflation

                              target  band  for  2023  to  2024.  Amid  all  the  uncertainty,  the  national


                              government's  inflation  target  remains  an  important  anchor  for  guiding  the

                              economy  through  the  downturn  and  recovery  stages.  This  inflation  target

                              serves  as  an  important  guidepost  for  the  BSP.  Monetary  authorities  could

                              continue to provide support to the economy after the health crisis through a

                              resolute  commitment  to  deliver  low  and  stable  inflation.  Latest  forecasts


                              indicate that inflation will remain within target in 2020 until 2022. BSP forecasts

                              suggest that inflation could average at 2.6 percent for 2020, 3.2 percent for

                              2021, and 2.9 percent for 2022. The balance of risks to the inflation outlook

                              also leans toward the downside from 2020 to 2022, owing largely to potential

                              disruptions  to  domestic  and  global  economic  activity  amid  the  ongoing

                              pandemic. Similarly, inflation expectations appear to be well-anchored to the

                              target range (Diokno, 2021).]]></page><page Index="207"><![CDATA[23


                              •  Social Factors

                              The  Philippines  had  a  population  of  110.3  million  in  January  2021.  The


                              Philippines’s  population  increased  by  1.5  million  (+1.3%)  between  January

                              2020 and January 2021. 49.8% of the Philippines’s population is female, while

                              50.2% of its population is male [note: The United Nations does not publish data

                              for  genders  other  than  ‘female’  and  ‘male’].  47.6%  of  the  Philippines’s

                              population lives in urban centers, while 52.4% lives in rural areas.

                              Filipinos are generally very friendly, hospitable, helpful, and optimistic people.

                              They are also well-known for their positive attitude and the sense of humor.


                              Many of them do their best and go extra miles in making visitors feel almost

                              like VIP’s. No wonder why many tourists visit the country time and again. Both

                              Filipino  and  English  are  the  official  languages  in  the  Philippines;  however,

                              about  87  dialects  are  spoken  all  over  the  country.  Christianity  is  the  major

                              religion, and Islam is in the 2nd position. As of January 2020, the population of

                              the country is approximately 108 million. The life expectancy for men is 66


                              years, while 73 years for women (BBC, 2018). An educated, highly trainable,

                              and English-speaking work force has made it easy for foreign companies to run

                              their operations in the Philippines. However, the country is not without some

                              social challenges e.g., corruption, poverty, drug abuse, extra-judicial killings,

                              and lack of job opportunities to name but a few.

                              •  Technological Factors


                              The  use  of  digital  technologies  such  as  digital  payments,  e-commerce,

                              telemedicine, and online education, is rising in the Philippines and has helped

                              individuals,  businesses,  and  the  government  cope  with  social  distancing

                              measures, ensure business continuity, and deliver public services during the

                              pandemic. The use of digital technologies in the Philippines, however, is still


                              below its potential, with the country’s digital adoption generally trailing behind

                              many regional neighbors. The “digital divide” between those with and without]]></page><page Index="208"><![CDATA[24


                              internet leads to unequal access to social services and life-changing economic

                              opportunities.  Where  internet  services  are  available,  Filipino  consumers

                              experience slow download speeds. At 16.76 megabytes per second (Mbps),

                              the  Philippines’s  mobile  broadband  speed  is  much  lower  than  the  global


                              average of 32.01 Mbps. In the region, the 3G/4G mobile average download

                              speed  stands  at  13.26  Mbps  compared  to  only  seven  (7)  Mbps  in  the

                              Philippines.  Efforts  to  enhance  digital  infrastructure  in  the  Philippines  are

                              hindered by a lack of competition as well as restrictions on investment in the

                              telecommunications  markets,  according  to  the  report.  These  restrictions


                              include the public utility designation of telecommunications, which limits foreign

                              ownership and places a cap on the rate of return.

                              •  Environmental Factors

                              The Philippines is prone to natural disasters, particularly typhoons, floods,

                              landslides,  volcanic  eruptions,  earthquakes,  and  tsunamis,  lying  as  it  does

                              astride the typhoon belt, in the active volcanic region known as the “Pacific Ring


                              of  Fire,”  and  in  the  geologically  unstable  region  between  the  Pacific  and

                              Eurasian  tectonic  plates.  The  Philippines  also  suffers  major  human-caused

                              environmental  degradation  aggravated  by  a  high  annual  population  growth

                              rate,  including  loss  of  agricultural  lands,  deforestation,  soil  erosion,  air  and

                              water pollution, improper disposal of solid and toxic wastes, loss of coral reefs,

                              mismanagement and abuse of coastal resources, and overfishing. More than

                              attractions  mesmerize  tourists  in  the  Philippines.  However,  the  country  is

                              constantly faced with some environmental challenges. For instance, it is prone

                              to earthquakes, typhoons and volcanic eruptions. It loses around $6.4 billion

                              each year due to natural disasters and 20 typhoons on average hit it every year.]]></page><page Index="209"><![CDATA[25


                              Other environmental challenges to mention are air and water pollution, illegal

                              mining, deforestation, coastal erosion, and loss of biodiversity.

                                 than  is  essential  and  should  be  clear,  transparent,  objective,  non-

                                 discriminatory,  proportional,  flexible,  and  technologically  neutral.

                                 Mechanisms for private sector input and involvement in policy making shall

                                 be promoted and widely used.

                              b.  Role of the Private Sector. - The development of electronic commerce shall


                                 be  led  primarily  by  the  private  sector  in  response  to  market  forces.

                       IV. Benchmarking




                          A.  Identify Problematic Areas

                              •  Rapid Expansion

                                 CD-R King expanded rapidly in the early to mid-2000s, opening branches

                                 in most of the major shopping centers like SM and Robinsons malls, and

                                 even in so-called higher-end malls like the Podium. By 2016, CD-R King


                                 had about 350 branches, according to the Game Changer feature. They

                                 had branches in nearly every major city, including in provinces like Baguio,

                                 Batangas, Laguna, Rizal, Cebu and as far away as Ozamiz City. All of them

                                 were  company-owned.  Although  CDR-King  was  able  to  expand

                                 excessively, these branches are all company owned and not franchised.


                                 Which results to increased growth risk.

                              •  Product Quality

                                 Many questioned the quality of the products, with some accusing the store

                                 of selling substandard merchandise that broke or fell apart way too soon.

                                 Despite gaining popularity for offering gadgets and computer accessories

                                 at  discounted  prices,  the  company  has  gained  a  somewhat  dubious

                                 reputation for its build quality, with some items breaking down shortly after


                                 purchase.

                              •  Payment system

                                 For years, sales personnel wrote out receipts by hand for all purchases,

                                 which doubled or tripled the waiting time for its customers. Even well into]]></page><page Index="216"><![CDATA[32


                                 its 10th year of existence, the store still kept the same system, which has

                                 led many people to question why it hasn’t adopted a more efficient way of

                                 completing this part of the transaction.


                              •  Lack of online presence

                                 Currently, CDR-King only have items for sale in Lazada, but not in other e-

                                 commerce platforms. It’s a fact that consumers will simply buy these items

                                 where  it’s  convenient  for  them.  And  when  we  talk  about  convenience,

                                 there’s probably nothing more convenient than buying them online.

                          B.  Identify other Industries that have Similar Processes


                              Electronic  Industry  which  CDR-King  belongs  has  the  similar  process  with

                              Manufacturing  Industry.  Manufacturing  is  the  process  of  converting  raw

                              material and components into the final product to sell in the marketplace for

                              public consumption. Manufacture industry has many categories, for example,

                              food  industry,  petroleum  industry,  paper  industry,  wood  industry,  leather

                              industry,  textile  mill  industry,  apparel  industry,  transportation  equipment


                              industry, electrical equipment industry etc. Goods can be prepared in the mill,

                              factories or plants for example fabric and goods can also be prepared by hands

                              to sell in the market. Manufacturing industries provide employment to educated

                              as well as labor class population of any country. In America, approximately 12

                              billion people are employed in the manufacturing industry.

                          C.  Identify Organizations that are Leaders in these Areas


                              As  economies  prosper  all  over  the  world,  the  top  10  largest  electronics

                              companies  in  the  world  are  contributing  to  stellar  growth  through  the

                              manufacturing,  exports,  imports,  and  sales  of  consumer  electronics  —  the

                              segment  driving  a  vast  majority  of  this  growth.  Aside  from  consumer

                              electronics,  the  electronics  industry  is  also  divided  into  electric  utilities  and

                              general  electronics.  Just  how  much  is  the  electronics  industry  worth?  The]]></page><page Index="217"><![CDATA[33


                              global market for electronic components is predicted to grow at a compound

                              annual growth rate (CAGR) of about 5.6% from by 2024

                              At the forefront of an evolving electronics market are companies like Apple,

                              innovating with iPhones and Samsung with their Samsung Galaxy devices and


                              the leading manufacturer of semiconductors for the global electronics market.

                              Foxconn, from Taiwan, is also paving the way in the industry, changing the

                              rules and disrupting the market through its contract electronics manufacturing

                              services. Which  of these  companies  will  come out  at the  top  of  our  largest

                              electronics  companies  in  the  world  list?  This  article  will  breakdown  the  top


                              companies  by  revenue,  in  addition  to  the  top  electronics  exporters  and

                              importers in the global market in 2020.

                              Apple is the largest electronics company in the world by revenue, generating a

                              total of USD 260.17 billion in revenue in 2019. As a leader among the largest

                              electronics  companies  in  the  world,  this  American  multinational  technology

                              company  based  in  California  designs,  develops,  and  sells  consumer

                              electronics, computer software, and online services. Apple’s flagship product


                              is  the  iPhone,  a  game-changer,  and  an  industry  pioneer  in  the  world  of

                              smartphones. Apple is considered one of the Big Four technology companies,

                              along  with  Microsoft,  Google,  and  Amazon.  Apple  became  the  world’s  first

                              company  to  record  a  market  capitalization  of  $1  trillion,  and  subsequently

                              passed the $1.3 trillion threshold in Dec. 2019. To put it in perspective. that


                              number is larger than entire economies — only 14 countries have annual GDP

                              figures greater than Apple’s market cap.

                              Samsung Electronics is the 2nd largest electronics company in the world with

                              image sensors. Samsung is also the world’s largest manufacturer of mobile

                              phones and smartphones, known for its flagship Samsung Galaxy product line

                              of smartphones. The company also created the phablet market with its line of


                              Samsung Galaxy note devices.

                              Ranking 3rd on BizVibe’s list of the top 10 largest electronics companies in the

                              world  in  2020  is  Taiwanese  multinational  electronics  manufacturer  Hon Hai

                              Precision Industry — also known as Foxconn. Foxconn is the largest private

                              employer  in  Taiwan  and  the  largest  provider  of  electronics  manufacturing


                              services in the world. In 2019, Hon Hai Precision Industry generated revenues

                          D.  Best Practices of other Companies

                              The first best practice is the ability to use the vast data that has been collected

                              over  a  period  of  time  and  run  time  data.  Processes  use  modern  data

                              warehousing and heuristic modelling to predict the future. This is especially

                              useful in the two critical areas of finance and global supply chain management.


                              Apple is famous for its innovation and design. But few people know that the

                              way Apple handles inventory is also a factor that led to success. In a nutshell,

                              Apple purchases components and materials from various suppliers, then gets

                              them  shipped  to  the  assembling  plant  in  China.  From  there,  products  are

                              shipped  directly  to  consumers  (via  UPS/FedEx)  who  bought  from  Apple's

                              Online Store. For other distribution channels such as retail stores and other

                              distributors,  Apple  keeps  products  at  Elk  Grove,  California  (where  central]]></page><page Index="219"><![CDATA[35


                              warehouse and call center are located) and ships products from there. At the

                              end of product's life, customer can send products back to nearest Apple Stores

                              or dedicated recycling facilities.






                                CORPORATE AND BUSINESS LEVEL STRATEGIC ANALYSIS



                       I. Corporate Strategies

                       CD-R  King’s  corporate  strategy  is  to  constantly  expand  their  product  base.  CD-R


                       King’s business began in the selling recordable media in bulk at a fraction of the cost,

                       but CD-R King has developed itself to become much more than that specific industry.

                       CD-R King now offers a variety of different products that include optical storage media,

                       cellular phones, electronic gadgets, accessories, appliances, and electric bicycles. A

                       way that CD-R King incorporates its strategy is by using product differentiation and to

                       be specific, Concentric Diversification. Concentric Diversification is characterized by

                       the addition of a new yet related company/products. It entails the purchase of firms


                       that  are technologically,  market-wise,  or  product-wise connected to the purchasing

                       organization.  The  chosen  new  business  is  compatible  with  the  firm's  present

                       operations. CD-R King sells various products under their CD-R King, Stark and Kenko

                       World brands, in addition to licensed merchandise based on Disney properties among

                       other  things.  CD-R  King  have  their  branding  divisions  like  STARK  for  appliances,


                       California  ECO-BIKE  for  electric  bicycles,  Mobile  King  for  cell  phones,  and  Kenko

                       World for their cell phone accessories and health and beauty products.

                       II. Business Level Strategies

                       CD-R  King’s  vision  “Is  to  provide  every  Filipino  with  the  latest  technology  at  an

                       affordable price” and the mission is “To be the No. 1 top media & technology provider

                       in the Philippines that could provide the latest technology at an affordable price without]]></page><page Index="220"><![CDATA[36


                       extra  cost  and  also  to  be  able  to  deliver  up-to-date  technologies  to  the  Philippine

                       market with the latest computer related products as well as computer accessories.”

                       CDR King’s generic marketing strategy places an emphasis on low cost and affordable

                       products. The cost leadership strategy involves a company winning market share by


                       focusing  on  cost-conscious  or  price-sensitive  customers.  This  is  accomplished  by

                       having the lowest prices in the target market, or the lowest price to value ratio. For this

                       approach  to  be  successful  the  company  must  have  lower  operating  cost  than  its

                       competitors. CDR King accomplishes this by; Not selling their branded products, they

                       do  not  participate  in  heavy  advertising,  warranties  are  kept  short  so  they  are  not


                       factored into the price CDR King operates very similar to a franchise model, all of its

                       products are sold with a CDR King logo, all employees wear uniforms and every CDR

                       King store has the same color scheme, the model of the company is molded after

                       McDonalds except they sell cd’s and technology gadgets and not hamburgers, and

                       CDR King collects all payments manually and manage inventory in the same manner.

                       The strategy is to penetrate the technology market through customers they consider

                       the regular Joe. The current target market of CDR king is the C and D market across


                       the Philippines.

                       III. Corporate and Business Level Strategic Analysis

                       CD-R King has moved beyond selling recordable media to offering a variety of different

                       products  that  include  optical  storage  media,  cellular  phones,  electronic  gadgets,

                       accessories,  appliances,  and  electric  bicycles.  Diversification  is  in  it  itself  a  good


                       marketing strategy, but the company should concentrate on development of quality

                       products to cut down on increased numbers of defective products and recalls.



                          A.  Gap Analysis

                              Gap analysis is a methodology that helps a company identify gaps and decide

                              upon marketing strategies and tactics. For CD-R King, there is a large gap

                              between  product  strategy  and  socio-economic  and  demographic  changes.]]></page><page Index="221"><![CDATA[37


                              Also, not being able to keep in pace with technology resulted for the company

                              bad reputation it accumulated over time facilitated the further weakening of its

                          C.  Alternative Strategies

                              CD-R King’s current strategy of launching more new products to expand the

                              markets  should  be  sustained.  However,  the  company  should  also  try  to

                              promote its products through media advertising and improve the product quality

                              to increase the satisfaction level of the customers. CD-R king never seemed to


                              experience intense competition before since it had strong market power and

                              had  the  ability  to  introduce  new  products,  but  nowadays,  electronic  retail

                              industry had numerous new entrants thus CD-R king must invest in its R & D

                              department to produce high quality products. Also, to reduce the queuing time,

                              CD-R king should use POS counters instead of manually computing the items.

                          D.  Evaluating Alternative Strategies

                              CDR-King should further digitalize the promotion and services of its business.


                              To increase organic traffic and online presence the company should publish

                              SEO-optimized blog posts on the company's own website and external sources

                              the target audience follows.

                              Although it may severely stretch the company budget at first, investing in R&D

                              will be beneficial for the company in the long-run. Considering the fact that


                              ruined reputation due to numerous complaints regarding the product quality is]]></page><page Index="223"><![CDATA[39


                              one of the main factors why CD-R king is now suffering loss, investing in R&D

                              is definitely the right strategy.

                          E.  Final Strategies

                              Employees  are  important  asset  of  the  organization.  They  serve  as  human

                              enjoyment,  work  relationships,  and  work  processes.  However,  culture  is

                              something which the people cannot actually see, except through its physical

                              manifestations in workplace.

                                     the inequality in the organization. Some employees have more power

                                     than  others,  while  some  other  employees  have  better  status  and

                                     respect in the organization.

                                     organization interest and employees’ self-interest have perfectly been

                                     matched.

                                 •  Uncertainty avoidance – In the dimension of uncertainty avoidance, all

                                     employees have to face the fact that they do not know what is going to

                                     happen tomorrow.


                                 •  Masculinity and femininity – Masculinity and femininity reflect whether

                                     a  certain  organization  is  predominantly  male  or  female  in  terms  of

                                     cultural values, gender roles and power relations.

                                     mission.  When  values  are  out  of  alignment,  people  work  towards


                                     different goals, with different intentions, and with different outcomes.]]></page><page Index="228"><![CDATA[44

                       II. Strategic Control

                       Upon evaluating your proposed strategies, CD-R King will use Balanced Scorecard as

                       its  strategic  control  technique.  A  balanced  scorecard  is  a  strategy  performance

                       management tool – a well-structured report, that can be used by managers to keep


                       track of the execution of activities by the staff within their control and to monitor the

                       consequences arising from these actions. To effectively monitor the effectiveness of

                       the strategies that the company implemented, a balanced scorecard is the suitable tool

                       to be used. The balanced scorecard includes financial measures that tell the results of

                       actions already taken. And it complements the financial measures with operational


                       measures  on  customer  satisfaction,  internal  processes,  and  the  organization’s

                       innovation and improvement activities—operational measures that are the drivers of

                       future financial performance.

                       III. Organizational Systems in Evaluation

                              The Proposed organization system in evaluating the proposed strategies for

                       CD-R  King  is  Control  system.  Controlling  is  the  measurement  and  correction  of

                       performance in order to make sure that enterprise objectives and the plans devised to


                       attain them are being accomplished. Control is the last function of management. The

                       controlling  function  will  be  unnecessary  to  the  management  if  other  functions  of

                       management are performed properly. If there is any imperfection in the planning and

                       actual performance, control will be needed.]]></page><page Index="233"><![CDATA[49
