The course begins with an introduction to the nature of mathematics as an exploration of patterns (in nature and the environment) and                                as an application of inductive and deductive reasoning. By exploring these topics, students are encouraged to go beyond the typical                                understanding of mathematics as merely a set of formulas but as a source of aesthetics in patterns of nature, for example, and a rich                 Course         language in itself (and of science) governed by logic and reasoning.                 Description                                 The course then proceeds to survey ways in which mathematics provides a tool for understanding and dealing with various aspects                                of present-day living, such as managing personal finances, making social choices, appreciating geometric designs, understanding                                codes, used in data transmission and security, and dividing limited resources fairly. These aspects will provide opportunities for actually                                doing mathematics in a broad range of exercises that bring out the various dimensions of mathematics as a way of knowing and test                                the students’ understanding and capacity.

DEPARTMENT OF ARTS AND SCIENCES   COURSE SYLLABUS  First Semester, AY 2022-2023  Course   GNED 03   Course   Mathematics in the Modern World   Type   Lecture    Credit   3  Code   Title                                   Units  This course deals with nature of mathematics, appreciation of its practical, intellectual and aesthetic dimensions, and application of  mathematical tools in daily life.   The course begins with an introduction to the nature of mathematics as an exploration of patterns (in nature and the environment) and  as an application of inductive and deductive reasoning. By exploring these topics, students are encouraged to go beyond the typical  understanding of mathematics as merely a set of formulas but as a source of aesthetics in patterns of nature, for example, and a rich  Course   language in itself (and of science) governed by logic and reasoning.  Description   The course then proceeds to survey ways in which mathematics provides a tool for understanding and dealing with various aspects  of present-day living, such as managing personal finances, making social choices, appreciating geometric designs, understanding  codes, used in data transmission and security, and dividing limited resources fairly. These aspects will provide opportunities for actually  doing mathematics in a broad range of exercises that bring out the various dimensions of mathematics as a way of knowing and test  the students’ understanding and capacity.
