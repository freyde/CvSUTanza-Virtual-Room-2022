                               This course deals with nature of mathematics, appreciation of its practical, intellectual and aesthetic dimensions, and application of
                               mathematical tools in daily life.

                               The course begins with an introduction to the nature of mathematics as an exploration of patterns (in nature and the environment) and
                               as an application of inductive and deductive reasoning. By exploring these topics, students are encouraged to go beyond the typical
                               understanding of mathematics as merely a set of formulas but as a source of aesthetics in patterns of nature, for example, and a rich
                Course         language in itself (and of science) governed by logic and reasoning.
                Description

                               The course then proceeds to survey ways in which mathematics provides a tool for understanding and dealing with various aspects
                               of present-day living, such as managing personal finances, making social choices, appreciating geometric designs, understanding
                               codes, used in data transmission and security, and dividing limited resources fairly. These aspects will provide opportunities for actually
                               doing mathematics in a broad range of exercises that bring out the various dimensions of mathematics as a way of knowing and test
                               the students’ understanding and capacity.

 COURSE SYLLABUS
 First Semester, AY 2022-2023
 Course   GNED 03   Course   Mathematics in the Modern World   Type   Lecture    Credit   3
 Code   Title                                   Units
 This course deals with nature of mathematics, appreciation of its practical, intellectual and aesthetic dimensions, and application of
 mathematical tools in daily life.

 The course begins with an introduction to the nature of mathematics as an exploration of patterns (in nature and the environment) and
 as an application of inductive and deductive reasoning. By exploring these topics, students are encouraged to go beyond the typical
 understanding of mathematics as merely a set of formulas but as a source of aesthetics in patterns of nature, for example, and a rich
 Course   language in itself (and of science) governed by logic and reasoning.
 Description

 The course then proceeds to survey ways in which mathematics provides a tool for understanding and dealing with various aspects
 of present-day living, such as managing personal finances, making social choices, appreciating geometric designs, understanding
 codes, used in data transmission and security, and dividing limited resources fairly. These aspects will provide opportunities for actually
 doing mathematics in a broad range of exercises that bring out the various dimensions of mathematics as a way of knowing and test
 the students’ understanding and capacity.
