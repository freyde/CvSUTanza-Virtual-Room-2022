             Videos on Importance of Segmentation and Positioning

             According to Prof. Rakesh Kumar segmentation is the process of dividing a heterogeneous
             market into specific homogeneous market based on specific consumer characteristics.
             Marketing segmentation is based on demographics, psychological factor, lifestyle, marketing
             context, culture and price band associated with the product category. As I watch the video I
             could say that segmentation and positioning plays a big role in the market industry because it
             is the one who classifies customers' needs and wants based on the benefits that they were
             looking for. Just like what Professor Kumar said that "different consumer segment requires
             different benefits “that is why segmentation and positioning is important.


             Videos on Segmentation and Marketing Mix Elements
                   Based on my understanding of this, there are so-called stimuli in consumer behavior
             because they have various aspects of the environmental impact on our senses.
             In other words called five senses for sensory branding to know what the product is showing.
             and in the Marketing mix, it is said to have an important impact on the physche of the
             consumer. It is said that the stimulus factor is not only associated with the specific brand, it is
             also said to be a competitive environment. Marketing mix elements are not only based on
             respective brands but also from the offering of competitive brands.]]></page><page Index="35"><![CDATA[Videos on Types of Brand and Value

                 The man in the video says that, “The brand needs to ensure what excels in the
             difference among its competitors.”

             The video about the Brand and Value and their different types and their functions or
             benefits to the consumers. It

             can be functional, symbolic or hedonic. It’s also about what the consumers receive in
             exchange of money or the

             effort they exert.


             Videos on Targeting and Positioning

                     After I watch the video about Targeting and Positioning, I realize that Consumer
             Behavior are indeed connected to the Targeting and Positioning. The antidote of consumer
             towards to the brands is likely to be strengthen. That is the aspects of Consumer Behavior. In
             most Brand Positioning and Targeting it teach the consumer to have self-reliance,
             independence, woman empowerment and Ideal man that doing well,  and it develop self-
             esteem of the consumers. Brand Positioning and Targeting has an impact on consumer from
             product to brand, it gives unique aspects and also create an image in the mind of the
             consumer with the respect to the brand. Speaker end the discussion saying that "It gives an
             idea on how segmentation, targeting and positioning is all about, module does not deal with
             the operation aspects but on how segmentation can be accomplish to the brand."

             Videos on Psychographics


                  On my understanding, psychographics are kind of like demographics. Demographics
             explain "who" you buyer is, while psychographics explain "why" they buy. Psychographic
             information might be your buyer's hobbies, habits, spending habits and values. It seems like
             being able to quickly judge the psychographics of your customers will help you to understand
             what they are looking for.

                 The only thing that I can say about the video is, it is hard to understand because of the
             accent of Professor Kumar but when you read the module it become easier to understand.
             But in over all, videos on psychographics is very useful and we can use all the information
             that we learned on videos to marketing.]]></page><page Index="36"><![CDATA[Republic of the Philippines

             Videos on Types of Decision and Decision Making

             Decision making is one of the complex ideas of human behavior, we will know how to apply the
             decision making on how consumers decides. There is different kinds of decisions, day to day
             decisions, well-thought out decisions, and impulsive decisions. The complexity of consumer decisions
             can be attribute to some aspects, this include some factors that influence the consumer decision
             making. Consumer behavior are use to analyze the decision of the consumer. There are three kinds
             of decision making, first is routine decision making, it is some kind of re-ordering, second is
             intermediary decision making, it talks about kind of getting new, last is elaborate decision making
             where there is process of information. In degree of involvement, target segment reflects the enduring
             involvement or situational involvement, this kind of decision making there is impulse buying tension
             was created because brand or products that can be seen by the consumer the tension was result only
             when the consumer buys it. It impulsive buying because the consumer wants to buy the products with
             or without thinking of the consequence of making to buy.




             Videos on Consumer Decision Making Influencers

             There are some aspects to consider in decision making, you have to know what to acquire, when to
             acquire, when to consume, where to consume and how to consume it, how to dispose the product off?
             There is so much hypothetically examples that consumer decision making, it is like buying a watch
             what and why he/she want to buy it ? is it for promotion? Collections of branded watch, to see her/his
             friends wear it? Is she/he inspired? Power of emotions in various context, emotions extremely]]></page><page Index="37"><![CDATA[important in rational and irrational decisions. Rational is not completely rational to economic
             viewpoint, consumer is train to apply the recent when coming to decision making. Irrational decisions
             is more in emotional decision where the consumer is not giving in to a rational arguments. Power of
             emotions appeal in deferent aspects. Automatic Information Processing is a process of information
             automatically with their knowledge, it is also has impact for the feelings, goals and behavior, the
             concept of adaptive unconscious, consumer can use automatic processing system to create an
             automatic set of behavior concern in routine matters.









             Videos on Role of Culture in Decision Making

             Cultural backdrop affects in consumer decision making, cultural aspects before entering into decision
             making the mind to the consumer. Culture is need to be consider in the marketing program.












             Videos on Role of Emotions in Decision Making

             According to Prof. Rakesh Kumar motivation is the actionable part of consumers, which
             propel the consumers into action. A consumer without a specific motivation will not be able to
             focus on its efforts. Also, motivation plus emotion provides a powerful focus for the consumer.
             Therefore, emotion plays a big role in decision making because consumer choice is the result
             of a rational analysis of available alternatives it also create preferences, which lead to
             someone's decision. As I watched the video I could say that emotions really affect someone's
             decision making.



             Videos on Social Judgment Theory

             Social Judgement Theory

                    This theory of self-persuasion proposed by Carolyn Sherif, Muzafer Sherif, Carl Hovland, and
             defined by Sherif. It is when an approach and evaluation of an idea change compared to the current
             situation or event.]]></page><page Index="38"><![CDATA[Republic of the Philippines

             Videos on Importance of Consumer Behavior


                     Understanding  Consumer  Behavior  is  important  for  a  company  to  find  success  for  its  current
             products as well as new product launches. It is important to understand to understand the consumer

             behavior on marketing strategies because it is the essence of marketing used to energized the business.
             There  are  three  impact  of  Consumer  Behavior  on  Marketing  Concepts;  Consumer  Mindset  as  the

             direction, Organizational Direction and Environmental Direction. It can be define by the consumer's

             emotions,  sensual  pleasure  of  a  consumers  and  tangible  benefits.  Consumer  Behavior  is  important
             because it has a direction taking in the mindset of the consumer also has to connect with the lifestyle of

             the consumers.




             Videos on Consumer Behavior Frameworks


                     The world of business is characterized by a spirit of stiff competition in the market. This situation
             calls  for  sensitivity  and  readiness  of  every  business  firm  in  order  to  survive  in  the  competitive
             environment. Hence, understanding consumer behavior framework will help us to determine what goes

             in the minds of consumers and what are the factors that influence on their decision-making in choosing
             a particular brand. Since numerous actions must be put into place to have a sustainable edge and attain

             position in the market, consumer behavior framework can be a good reference in making business
             decisions, doing planning and in formulating better strategies. Moreover, I have noticed the impact of
             consumer behavior framework in the production department since we need to understand and consider

             the  consumer  behavior  if  there  is  need  for  changing  the  existing  products,  adding  new  ones,  and
             decisions on branding, standardizing and other product features.]]></page><page Index="39"><![CDATA[Videos on Cultural Symbolism


                       Cultural Symbolism plays an important role in consumer behavior specially countries with diverse
             culture. The product that the company offers symbolize the culture of its country meaning when you are

             offering a product you also offering your culture to them. Your products shows how you value your
             culture just like the example on the video. The kellog's cornflakes need to be taken with hot milk In India
             but on the other parts of the world they are using cold milk to consume it. That's how India value their

             culture and it need to be symbolize also to their products. And it shows that cultural symbolism really
             affects the consumer behaviors towards buying a product.





             Videos on Digitalization and Consumer Behavior



                      The invention of the Internet has changed the world we live in, the way we communicate, learn,
             and make purchases. Considering that the technology had so significant impact on people's lives, it

             probably changed their behavior as a consumer. Consumer have more power than ever before and
             have more access to information. And also, the marketers can gather more information about consumer.

             In this digital world marketers can enhance relationships with customers more effectively and efficiently.

             Videos on Consumer Learning and Its Types and Importance

                  There are four elements noted concerning to the Behavioral Learning such as Motive,
             Cues, Response and Reinforcement. Motives is within the consumer, what drive the

             consumer to buy the product it is pertaining to the unfulfilled needs. While Cues are the

             stimuli that suggest a specific way to satisfy your motives. There are so many cues
             competing consumer attention, some are part of the external environment while there are

             also created by other marketers and on social media. Response is the consumer’s reaction to
             a cue. Then the Reinforcement leads to brand loyalty because it deals with the reward,

             enjoyment and benefits that the consumer received after buying a product.

             There are two types of Consumer Learning theories Behavioral Learning and Cognitive
             Learning and this two types of learning both can be used to drive awareness and to convince

             customer to purchase your product. Behavioral Learning is referred as stimulus-response
             theories, it focus on the learning occurs in response to external cues or stimuli. Classical

             Conditioning, a well-studied theory of behavioral learning. It suggest that when two stimuli are]]></page><page Index="41"><![CDATA[paired together to produce a particular learned response through repetition, and the absence

             of one stimuli will produce the same response.
             Cognitive Learning says that the consumer doesn’t learn from association. This learning

             focusing on how information is processed by the human mind and it is all about problem

             solving. Gathering facts about the products or services process those facts then recalling
             them. Furthermore, the importance of this two types of learning is to make the consumer

             aware to the products or services while in us marketer it helps us to develop successful
             strategies and campaigns that will drive their awareness, consideration and purchase to our

             products and services.


             Videos on Classical Conditioning and Theory of Learning




                   Classical  conditioning  is  a  form  of  learning  by  which  a conditioned  stimulus be
             transformed  as  associated  with  an  unrelated unconditioned  stimulus in  order  to  produce  a

             behavioral  response  known  as  a conditioned  response. The  conditioned  response  is  the
             learned response to the previously neutral stimulus. The unconditioned stimulus is usually a

             biologically significant stimulus such as food or pain that elicits an unconditioned response from
             the start. The conditioned stimulus is usually neutral and produces no particular response at

             first,  but  after  conditioning  it  bring  out  the  conditioned  response.  Classical  conditioning  is

             established  by  Ivan  Pavlov  which  known  for  his  famous  experiment  with  conditioning  the
             salivation response in dogs, which brought about classical conditioning. He was a Russian

             scientist  whose  work  with  dogs  has  been  influential  in  understanding  how  learning  occurs
             because of his research, the theory of Classical condition established.



             Videos on Application of Classical Conditioning


                     In  Classical  Conditioning  it  explain  many  aspects  of  consumer  behavior  or  human

             behavior. It tackles about different emotional responses of human. Classical conditioning is not

             just in the world of business, its application can be found also in school, or any post traumatic
             disorders that has something to do with their past. Application of Classical Conditioning is very

             challenging for a brand manager because it requires patient and understanding. The brand]]></page><page Index="42"><![CDATA[manager must possess good communication skill in order to apply the classical conditioning

             properly. Classical conditioning is a process of modifying someone’s behavior. It is present in
             our everyday life. Advertising executives usually hired attractive and popular model to promote

             their products because this has something to do with the brand image they want to possess.

             The result is that the product is now appealing to their consumer and it may look like a better
             version of their product.]]></page></pages></Search>
