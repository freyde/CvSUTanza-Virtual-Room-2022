BANATE, MBA              Week      CASE STUDY 1: Planning for the Chevy Volt               2                      General Motors is a company in deep trouble. As car sales in North America collapsed in 2008,         GM, which had already lost money in 2007, plunged deeply into the red. With losses estimated at $14 billion,          the company was forced to go cap in hand to the government to beg for public funds to help it stave off         bankruptcy. Fearing the economic consequences of a collapse of GM, the government agreed to loan funds         to GM, but it insisted that the company have a clear plan charting its way back to profitability. Ironically, such          a plan was already in place at GM. At the heart of it was a potentially huge gamble on a new type of car: the         Chevy Volt.                   The Chevy Volt, which was introduced in 2010, is a compact, four- door electric car with a reserve          gasoline-powered engine. The primary power source is a large lithium ion battery (lithium ion batteries are         typically found in small electric appliances such as cell phones). The battery can be charged by plugging it          into a wall socket for 6 hours; when fully charged, it will fuel the car for 40 miles, which is less than most         people’s daily commute. After that, a gasoline engine kicks in, providing both drive power and recharging the         lithium  ion  battery. GM  estimated fuel  economy  will  be  over  100 miles per  gallon,  and  charging  the  car          overnight from a power outlet would cost about 80% less than filling it with gas at $3 per gallon. The car will         have a starting cost of around $41,000; however, because it uses a battery- powered technology, buyers will         be able to take $7,500 tax credit.                    The Volt was the brainchild of two men, Bob Lutz, GM’s vice- chairman, and Larry Burns, the head         of  Research  \&  Development  and  strategic  planning  at  GM.  Although  Lutz  in  particular  had  always         championed large gas- hungry muscle cars, GM’s planning told them that the market would probably move          away from the SUVs that had been a profitable staple at GM for most of the 1990s. A number of trends were         coming together to make this scenario likely.                    First, oil prices, and by extension, gas prices, were increasing sharply. Although driving an SUV         that gets 12 miles to the gallon might make economic sense when gas was priced at $1 a gallon, it did not         for most people when gas was $4 per gallon. GM’s planning suggested that due to growing  demand in          developed nations, including China and India, and limited new supplies, the days of cheap oil were over.                                                                                                                  1","CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY                                                           Tanza          Second, global warming was becoming an increasing concern, and it seemed possible that tighter regulations         designed to limit carbon emissions would be introduced in the future. As a major source of greenhouses          gases, such as carbon dioxide, automobiles powered by internal combustion engines could hardly escape         this  trend.  Third,  the  cost  of  manufacturing  lithium  ion  batteries  was  falling,  and  new  technology  was         promising to make them more powerful. Finally, GM’s major competitor, Toyota, with its best-selling hybrid,          the Prius, had demonstrated that there was demand for fuel- efficient cars that utilized new battery technology         (the Prius, however, uses a conventional fuel cell as opposed to a lithium ion battery).                   Despite  their  analysis,  when  Lutz  and  Burns  first  proposed  making  the  Volt  in  2003,  other          managers at GM beat them down. For one thing, GM had already invested billions in developing fuel cells,         and many in the company did not want to suddenly switch gears and focus on lithium ion batteries instead.          Besides, said the critics, technologically it would be difficult to produce a large lithium ion battery. Others         were skeptical given that GM had already had one failure with an electric car, the ill- fated EV1 introduced in         the 1990s. Powered by a fuel cell, the EV1 had not sold well (according to many because the company had          not put its weight behind it).                   By 2006, however, the tide had started to turn. Not only were oil prices surging, as predicted by         the strategic planning group, but also a small Silicon Valley start- up, Telsa Motors, had announced that it          would be bringing a lithium ion sports car to market. Lutz’s reaction was, “if a start- up can do it, GM can too!”         So Lutz and Burns formed a skunk works within GM and quickly put together a Chevy Volt concept car, which         they unveiled at the 2007 Detroit auto show. The concept car gained a lot of positive feedback, and Lutz used          this to argue within the company that GM needed to commit to the project. Moreover, he argued, Toyota was         gaining major benefits from its Prius, both in terms of sales and the halo effect associated with making a          green car. This time Lutz and Burns were able to persuade other senior managers to back the project, and it         be was officially launched in early 2007 with an aggressive goal of market introduction in 2010.

BANATE, MBA              Week      CASE STUDY 1: Planning for the Chevy Volt               2                      General Motors is a company in deep trouble. As car sales in North America collapsed in 2008,         GM, which had already lost money in 2007, plunged deeply into the red. With losses estimated at $14 billion,          the company was forced to go cap in hand to the government to beg for public funds to help it stave off         bankruptcy. Fearing the economic consequences of a collapse of GM, the government agreed to loan funds         to GM, but it insisted that the company have a clear plan charting its way back to profitability. Ironically, such          a plan was already in place at GM. At the heart of it was a potentially huge gamble on a new type of car: the         Chevy Volt.                   The Chevy Volt, which was introduced in 2010, is a compact, four- door electric car with a reserve          gasoline-powered engine. The primary power source is a large lithium-ion battery (lithium-ion batteries are         typically found in small electric appliances such as cell phones). The battery can be charged by plugging it          into a wall socket for 6 hours; when fully charged, it will fuel the car for 40 miles, which is less than most         people’s daily commute. After that, a gasoline engine kicks in, providing both drive power and recharging the         lithium-ion  battery. GM  estimated fuel  economy  will  be  over  100  miles  per gallon,  and  charging the  car          overnight from a power outlet would cost about 80% less than filling it with gas at $3 per gallon. The car will         have a starting cost of around $41,000; however, because it uses a battery- powered technology, buyers will          be able to take $7,500 tax credit.                   The Volt was the brainchild of two men, Bob Lutz, GM’s vice- chairman, and Larry Burns, the head         of  Research  \&  Development  and  strategic  planning  at  GM.  Although  Lutz  in  particular  had  always          championed large gas- hungry muscle cars, GM’s planning told them that the market would probably move         away from the SUVs that had been a profitable staple at GM for most of the 1990s. A number of trends were         coming together to make this scenario likely.                    First, oil prices, and by extension, gas prices, were increasing sharply. Although driving an SUV         that gets 12 miles to the gallon might make economic sense when gas was priced at $1 a gallon, it did not         for most people when gas was $4 per gallon. GM’s planning suggested that due to growing demand in                                                                                                                   1","CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY                                                           Tanza          developed nations, including China and India, and limited new supplies, the days of cheap oil were over.         Second, global warming was becoming an increasing concern, and it seemed possible that tighter regulations          designed to limit carbon emissions would be introduced in the future. As a major source of greenhouses         gases, such as carbon dioxide, automobiles powered by internal combustion engines could hardly escape         this  trend.  Third,  the  cost  of  manufacturing  lithium-ion  batteries  was  falling,  and  new  technology  was          promising to make them more powerful. Finally, GM’s major competitor, Toyota, with its best-selling hybrid,         the Prius, had demonstrated that there was demand for fuel- efficient cars that utilized new battery technology         (the Prius, however, uses a conventional fuel cell as opposed to a lithium-ion battery).                    Despite  their  analysis,  when  Lutz  and  Burns  first  proposed  making  the  Volt  in  2003,  other         managers at GM beat them down. For one thing, GM had already invested billions in developing fuel cells,          and many in the company did not want to suddenly switch gears and focus on lithium-ion batteries instead.         Besides, said the critics, technologically it would be difficult to produce a large lithium-ion battery. Others         were skeptical given that GM had already had one failure with an electric car, the ill- fated EV1 introduced in          the 1990s. Powered by a fuel cell, the EV1 had not sold well (according to many because the company had         not put its weight behind it).                   By 2006, however, the tide had started to turn. Not only were oil prices surging, as predicted by          the strategic planning group, but also a small Silicon Valley start- up, Telsa Motors, had announced that it         would be bringing a lithium-ion sports car to market. Lutz’s reaction was, “if a start- up can do it, GM can too!”         So, Lutz and Burns formed a skunk works within GM and quickly put together a Chevy Volt concept car,          which they unveiled at the 2007 Detroit auto show. The concept car gained a lot of positive feedback, and         Lutz used this to argue within the company that GM needed to commit to the project. Moreover, he argued,          Toyota was gaining major benefits from its Prius, both in terms of sales and the halo effect associated with         making a green car. This time Lutz and Burns were able to persuade other senior managers to back the         project, and it was officially launched in early 2007 with an aggressive goal of market introduction in 2010.

BANATE, MBA               Week      CASE STUDY 3: The Pharmaceutical Industry              5-6                  Historically,  the  pharmaceutical  industry  has  been  a  profitable  one.  Between  2002  and  2006  the          average rate of return on invested capital (ROIC) for firms in the industry was 16.45%. Put differently, for         every dollar of capital invested in the industry, the average pharmaceutical firm generated 16.45 cents of         profit. This compares with an average return on invested capital of 12.76% for firms in the computer hardware          industry, 8.54% for grocers, and 3.88% for firms in the electronics industry. However, the average level of         profitability  in the  pharmaceutical  industry  has  been  declining  of  late.  In  2002, the  average  ROIC  in the         industry was 21.6%; by 2006, it had fallen to 14.5%.                 The profitability of the pharmaceutical industry can be best understood by looking at several aspects         of its underlying economic structure. First, demand for pharmaceuticals has been strong and has grown for         decades. Between 1990 and 2003, there was a 12.5% annual increase in spending on prescription drugs in          the United States. This growth was driven by favorable demographics. As people grow older, they tend to         need and consume more prescription medicines, and the population in most advanced nations has been          growing older as the post–World War II baby boom generation ages. Looking forward, projections suggest         that spending on prescription drugs will increase at between 10 and 11% annually through till 2013.                Second, successful new prescription drugs can be extraordinarily profitable. Lipitor, the cholesterol-          lowering drug sold by Pfizer, was introduced in 1997, and by 2006, this drug had generated a staggering         $12.5 billion in annual sales for Pfizer. The costs of manufacturing, packing, and distributing Lipitor amounted          to only about 10% of revenues. Pfizer spent close to $500 million on promoting Lipitor and perhaps as much         again on maintaining a sales force to sell the product. That still left Pfizer with a gross profit of perhaps $10         billion. Since the drug is protected from direct competition by a 20- year patent, Pfizer has a temporary          monopoly and can charge a high price. Once the patent expires, which is scheduled to occur in 2010, other         firms will be able to produce “generic” versions of Lipitor and the price will fall—typically by 80% within a year.                Competing firms can produce drugs that are similar (but not identical) to a patent- protected drug.          Drug firms patent a specific molecule, and competing firms can patent similar, but not identical, molecules         that have a similar pharmacological effect. Thus Lipitor does have competitors in the market for cholesterol         lowering drugs, such as Zocor sold by Merck and Crestor sold by AstraZeneca. But these competing drugs                                                                                                                   1","CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY                                                           Tanza          are also patent protected. Moreover, the high costs and risks associated with developing a new drug and         bringing it to market limit new competition. Out of every 5,000 compounds tested in the laboratory by a drug          company, only five enter clinical trials, and only one of these will ultimately make it to the market. On average,         estimates suggest that it costs some $800 million and takes anywhere from 10 to 15 years to bring a new         drug to market. Once on the market, only three out of 10 drugs ever recoup their R\&D and marketing costs          and turn a profit. Thus the high profitability of the pharmaceutical industry rests on a handful of blockbuster         drugs. At Pfizer, the world’s largest pharmaceutical company, 55% of revenues were generated from just         eight drugs.                    To produce a blockbuster, a drug company must spend large amounts of money on research, most         of which fails to produce a product. Only very large companies can shoulder the costs and risks of doing this,          making it difficult for new companies to enter the industry. Pfizer, for example, spent some $7.44 billion on         R\&D in 2005 alone, equivalent to 14.5% of its total revenues. In a testament to just how difficult it is to get         into the industry, although a large number of companies have been started in the last 20 years in the hope          that they might develop new pharmaceuticals, only two of these companies, Amgen and Genentech, were         ranked among the top 20 in the industry in terms of sales in 2005. Most have failed to bring a product to         market.                    In  addition  to  R\&D  spending,  the  incumbent  firms  in  the  pharmaceutical  industry  spend  large         amounts of money on advertising and sales promotion. While the $500 million a year that Pfizer spends         promoting Lipitor is small relative to the drug’s revenues, it is a large amount for a new competitor to match,          making market entry difficult unless the competitor has a significantly better product.                   There  are  also  some  big  opportunities  on  the  horizon  for  firms  in  the  industry.  New  scientific          breakthroughs in genomics are holding out the promise that within the next decade pharmaceutical firms         might  be  able  to  bring  new  drugs  to  market  that  treat  some  of  the  most  intractable  medical  conditions,         including Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s disease, cancer, heart disease, stroke, and AIDS. However, there are          some threats to the long- term dominance and profitability of industry giants like Pfizer. First, as spending on         health care rises, politicians are looking for ways to limit health care costs, and one possibility is some form          of price control on prescription drugs. Price controls are already in effect in most developed nations, and         although they have not yet been introduced in the United States, they could be.                   Second, between 2006 and 2009, 12 of the top 35 selling drugs in the industry will lose their patent          protection. By one estimate some 28% of the global drug industry’s sales of $307 billion will be exposed to         generic challenge in America alone, due to drugs going of patent between 2006 and 2012. It is not clear to         many industry observers whether the established drug companies have enough new drug prospects in their          pipelines to replace revenues from drugs going off patent. Moreover, generic drug companies have been         aggressive in challenging the patents of proprietary drug companies, and in pricing their generic offerings.         As a result, their share of industry sales has been growing. In 2005, they accounted for more than half of all          drugs prescribed by volume in the United States, up from one third in 1990.                   Third, the industry has come under renewed scrutiny following studies which showed that some                                                                                                                  2","CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY                                                           Tanza          FDA approved prescription drugs, known as COX- 2 inhibitors, were associated with a greater risk of heart         attacks.

BANATE, MBA               Week      CASE STUDY 1: KEEPING WITH THE TIMES—MCDONALD’S, I’M LOVIN’ IT!               2                     McDonald’s,  the  world’s  largest  restaurant  chain  with  over  30,000  outlets  in  more  than  115          countries, brings to mind many terms: golden arches, Big Macs, McNuggets, affordable meals, brand value,         and American capitalism, to name just a few. How did McDonald’s become one of the world’s best-known         brands? Needless to say, being in the food industry entails different menus for different parts of the world          based on varying tastes and preferences. At the time, McDonald’s made its foray into foreign markets it was         almost impossible to have a mass marketing or global strategy in terms of McDonald’s menu items. Therefore,         the company adopted a strategy to appeal to those different preferences. According to the company, the          secret to its successful brand is a type of multidomestic strategy, which the company used successfully by         being able to offer different menus in different countries.                    Previously,  McDonald’s  even  extended  this  strategy  to  marketing  for  its  restaurants  in  foreign         markets. Remember the yellow and red-garbed clown that attracted kids to McDonald’s? McDonald’s had         maintained the same image for years and by the start of the twenty-first century, it was not working anymore.          Additionally, the growing health consciousness among consumers the world over caused the restaurant chain         to  suffer  decreasing  profitability.  Nevertheless,  by  2005,  the  year  that  marked  its  fiftieth  anniversary,          McDonald’s was on its way to regaining its stardom.                   With time, it is necessary for companies to keep abreast of the changes that are taking place in         the environment. Today, many firms are shifting from a multidomestic or multinational strategy to a more          global one. It is believed that one reason for this is the growing convergence in consumer behavior, especially         for food and apparel. For example, consumers all over the world are moving toward a healthy lifestyle that         includes a healthy diet and exercise. For firms, a global strategy allows them to minimize overall costs, and          specifically  marketing  costs,  by  repeating  commercials  with  few  alterations,  justifying  high  advertising         expenditure to release a perfect ad. McDonald’s is one of several companies that have adopted a global         marketing strategy. McDonald’s has had to revive its global business over the past five years, one of the          ways to do it being to replace its previous shoddy image with a hip new one.                                                                                                                   1","CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY                    International Marketing                                                           Tanza                       In the year 2003, the company launched its first truly global marketing campaign called ‘‘I’m lovin’         it.’’ The new promotion effort aimed at changing the company’s image in markets all over the world sends the         same message to its global consumers with small changes for local tastes and preferences. Thus, even          though  there  is  still  a  significant  divergence  in  McDonald’s  menus,  the  new  global  marketing  campaign         instilled  a  distinct  global  brand  value  in  the  minds  of  consumers.  McDonald’s  invested  heavily  in  the         campaign, employing celebrities, such as singer Justin Timberlake and popular music group Destiny’s Child          who draw a global audience, to appear in its advertisements. In addition, McDonald’s introduced more healthy         foods in its menus such as salads. The ‘‘I’m lovin it’’ marketing campaign was targeted at consumers in all          age groups from kids and young adults to seniors. The conceptualization of the ad was also global. It was         the  brainchild  of  a  Germany-based  firm  Heye  and  Partner;  the  company  settled  on  this  agency  after         consulting with several marketing agencies in many different countries. The campaign has been one of the          most successful of its time. The strategy worked, and in just one year, the company’s revenues were up by         more  than  10  percent.  As  for  the  novel  marketing  drive,  the  company  won  Advertising  Age  magazine’s         Marketer of the Year Award for 2004. As for its recent comeback, McDonald’s is truly lovin’ it.                                                                                                                                               2","CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY                    International Marketing                                                           Tanza                                                      CASE ANALYSIS          Case Study:           MCDONALD             I.

BANATE, MBA              Week                      CASE STUDY 2: RUSSIA: A HUGE EMERGING CAR MARKET              3-4                                       ISOLATED   FROMOIL CRISIS                      High oil prices are causing pain for carmakers in America as people there are sacrificing their fancy         for  pick-up trucks  and  sport-utility  vehicles for more frugal  small  vehicles.  In  May  2008, General  Motors         announced a 30 percent fall in car sales, compared with a year earlier; Ford posted a 19 percent drop, and          sales of its F-150 pick-up fell behind Toyota’s Camry and Corolla for the first time. But far in Russia, the high         oil price is powering the expansion of the market rather than painful restructuring. Thanks to abundant natural         resources, Russia has been witnessing a rising economy since decade ago. With nearly doubled and steadily          rising real disposable income, cars are no longer unaffordable for many Russians.                   Currently, car ownership in Russia is still low at about 200 per 1,000 people, compared with the          over 500 in most of Western Europe and the around 800 in American (even in other former communist         countries in Central Europe, the number is between 300 and 350). But the car market there is expanding: in         2007 Russia’s sales of new cars grew 36 percent by volume and 57 percent by value; sales of passenger          vehicles exceeded 2.7million. According to analysts, Russia could outstrip Germany as Europe’s biggest         market by 2008, with sales reaching around 3.3 million; by 2012 Russians will be buying more than 5 million         new cars a year, of which nearly 90 percent will be foreign brands.                    However, all of the growth has been met by foreigners. Sales of Russian brands have stayed flat         for the past few years—hovering between 750,000 and 800,000. Early in 2002, a few years before foreign         carmakers’ rushing into Russia, the Russian government slapped a 25 percent duty on imported used cars          when domestic carmakers were struggling with challenges from imported second-hand cars. Unfortunately,         later new imports took their place as the sale of used imports fell. The new rivals took 48 percent of the          market by value in 2005. This time, instead of raising import duties again, Russian government passed a         measure intended to encourage foreign makers to set up local assembly plants so as to revive the Russian         car industries. According to the terms, to qualify for relief from import duty, foreign carmakers have to build a          factory with a capacity of more than 25,000 vehicles a year—a minimum investment of at least $100m. Within         five years of production starting, the local content in each car had to reach 30 percent.                                                                                                                  1","CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY                    International Marketing                                                           Tanza                    This triggered a scramble by the world’s biggest car firms to build factories in Russia. On the         crowded  list  are  American  firms  Ford  and  GM’s  Chevrolet,  Japan’s  Toyota,  Suzuki,  Nissan,  Isuzu,  and          Mitsubishi, South Korea’s Kia, Hyundai and Daewoo, and European makers Renault, Volkswagen, Fiat and         BMW. Chinese carmakers like Chery, Great Wall, and SsangYong are also trying to head into Russia.                   Doubtlessly, the foreign carmakers’ rush into Russia is promoting this country’s car industry as the          government expected. Currently, assembly of foreign models alone has attracted significant investment over         $2 billion in the first stage. And investment plans already announced suggest that new capacity could reach         1.6m units by 2012. However, foreign carmakers’ expansion on the Russian market is at the expense of          Russian ones.                   In 1990 Russian carmakers built 1.2 million passenger vehicles, but in 2007 they sold just 756,000.          AvtoVAZ, which makes more than 90 percent of the Russian-brand passenger cars, is still selling its Ladas         in  provincial  Russia  because  of  its  low  price,  the  large  number  of  dealers,  and  few  alternatives  there.         Currently, the main threat to Lada comes from very cheap Chinese cars and the possible change in the used-          car  business  policy.  Although  so  far  the  likes  of  Chery  and  Great  Wall  from  China  haven’t  received         permissions from the Russian authorities to set up in Russia, such situation may not last long. And if as         expected the 18 percent VAT on used cars sold by dealers is abolished, Lada’s price advantage will vanish.          Now AvtoVAZ’s main hope lies in the 25 percent stake recently acquired by Renault for $1 billion. Based on         Renault platforms, the largest Russian carmaker is expecting to bring new Ladas to market by 2010.                   Another local producer, Severstal-Auto, has decided to focus on small vans and trucks rather than          taking on foreign car brands due to the potentially large demand from the fast growing retail sectors. Severstal         already has a joint venture with Fiat to produce its Albea and Linea saloons. In May 2008, the first Fiat Ducato          van  was  successfully  driven  off  the  firm’s  new  production  line  in  Elabuga,  a  ‘‘free  economic  zone’’  in         Tatarstan.  Severstal  also  makes  small  and  medium-sized  Isuzu  trucks.  Another  possible  section  of  this         company probably will be high-margin services—actually Severstal is as well thinking about building a dealer          network so as to sell services such as adapting vehicles for school and hospitals, providing full-service leasing         arrangements and offering credit terms with local banks.                                                                                                                                 2","CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY                    International Marketing                                                           Tanza                                                      CASE ANALYSIS          Case Study:           RUSSIA: A HUGE EMERGING CAR MARKET ISOLATED   FROMOIL CRISIS          I.

BANATE, MBA              Week      CASE STUDY 1: KEEPING WITH THE TIMES—MCDONALD’S, I’M LOVIN’ IT!               2                      McDonald’s,  the  world’s  largest  restaurant  chain  with  over  30,000  outlets  in  more  than  115         countries, brings to mind many terms: golden arches, Big Macs, McNuggets, affordable meals, brand value,         and American capitalism, to name just a few. How did McDonald’s become one of the world’s best-known         brands? Needless to say, being in the food industry entails different menus for different parts of the world          based on varying tastes and preferences. At the time, McDonald’s made its foray into foreign markets it was         almost impossible to have a mass marketing or global strategy in terms of McDonald’s menu items. Therefore,          the company adopted a strategy to appeal to those different preferences. According to the company, the         secret to its successful brand is a type of multidomestic strategy, which the company used successfully by         being able to offer different menus in different countries.                    Previously,  McDonald’s  even  extended  this  strategy  to  marketing  for  its  restaurants  in  foreign         markets. Remember the yellow and red-garbed clown that attracted kids to McDonald’s? McDonald’s had          maintained the same image for years and by the start of the twenty-first century, it was not working anymore.         Additionally, the growing health consciousness among consumers the world over caused the restaurant chain         to  suffer  decreasing  profitability.  Nevertheless,  by  2005,  the  year  that  marked  its  fiftieth  anniversary,          McDonald’s was on its way to regaining its stardom.                   With time, it is necessary for companies to keep abreast of the changes that are taking place in         the environment. Today, many firms are shifting from a multidomestic or multinational strategy to a more          global one. It is believed that one reason for this is the growing convergence in consumer behavior, especially         for food and apparel. For example, consumers all over the world are moving toward a healthy lifestyle that         includes a healthy diet and exercise. For firms, a global strategy allows them to minimize overall costs, and          specifically  marketing  costs,  by  repeating  commercials  with  few  alterations,  justifying  high  advertising         expenditure to release a perfect ad. McDonald’s is one of several companies that have adopted a global                                                                                                                      1","CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY                    International Marketing                                                           Tanza          marketing strategy. McDonald’s has had to revive its global business over the past five years, one of the         ways to do it being to replace its previous shoddy image with a hip new one.                    In the year 2003, the company launched its first truly global marketing campaign called ‘‘I’m lovin’         it.’’ The new promotion effort aimed at changing the company’s image in markets all over the world sends the         same message to its global consumers with small changes for local tastes and preferences. Thus, even          though  there  is  still  a  significant  divergence  in  McDonald’s  menus,  the  new  global  marketing  campaign         instilled  a  distinct  global  brand  value  in  the  minds  of  consumers.  McDonald’s  invested  heavily  in  the         campaign, employing celebrities, such as singer Justin Timberlake and popular music group Destiny’s Child          who draw a global audience, to appear in its advertisements. In addition, McDonald’s introduced more healthy         foods in its menus such as salads. The ‘‘I’m lovin it’’ marketing campaign was targeted at consumers in all          age groups from kids and young adults to seniors. The conceptualization of the ad was also global. It was         the  brainchild  of  a  Germany-based  firm  Heye  and  Partner;  the  company  settled  on  this  agency  after         consulting with several marketing agencies in many different countries. The campaign has been one of the          most successful of its time. The strategy worked, and in just one year, the company’s revenues were up by         more  than  10  percent.  As  for  the  novel  marketing  drive,  the  company  won  Advertising  Age  magazine’s         Marketer of the Year Award for 2004. As for its recent comeback, McDonald’s is truly lovin’ it.                                                                                                                                               2","CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY                    International Marketing                                                           Tanza                                                      CASE ANALYSIS          Case Study:           KEEPING WITH THE TIMES—MCDONALD’S, I’M LOVIN’ IT!

In  May  2008, General  Motors         announced a 30 percent fall in car sales, compared with a year earlier; Ford posted a 19 percent drop, and          sales of its F-150 pick-up fell behind Toyota’s Camry and Corolla for the first time. But far in Russia, the high         oil price is powering the expansion of the market rather than painful restructuring. Thanks to abundant natural         resources, Russia has been witnessing a rising economy since decade ago. With nearly doubled and steadily          rising real disposable income, cars are no longer unaffordable for many Russians.                   Currently, car ownership in Russia is still low at about 200 per 1,000 people, compared with the         over 500 in most of Western Europe and the around 800 in American (even in other former communist          countries in Central Europe, the number is between 300 and 350). But the car market there is expanding: in         2007 Russia’s sales of new cars grew 36 percent by volume and 57 percent by value; sales of passenger         vehicles exceeded 2.7million. According to analysts, Russia could outstrip Germany as Europe’s biggest          market by 2008, with sales reaching around 3.3 million; by 2012 Russians will be buying more than 5 million         new cars a year, of which nearly 90 percent will be foreign brands.                    However, all of the growth has been met by foreigners. Sales of Russian brands have stayed flat         for the past few years—hovering between 750,000 and 800,000. Early in 2002, a few years before foreign         carmakers’ rushing into Russia, the Russian government slapped a 25 percent duty on imported used cars          when domestic carmakers were struggling with challenges from imported second-hand cars. Unfortunately,         later new imports took their place as the sale of used imports fell. The new rivals took 48 percent of the          market by value in 2005. This time, instead of raising import duties again, Russian government passed a         measure intended to encourage foreign makers to set up local assembly plants so as to revive the Russian         car industries. According to the terms, to qualify for relief from import duty, foreign carmakers have to build a          factory with a capacity of more than 25,000 vehicles a year—a minimum investment of at least $100m. Within         five years of production starting, the local content in each car had to reach 30 percent.                                                                                                                    1","CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY                    International Marketing                                                           Tanza                    This triggered a scramble by the world’s biggest car firms to build factories in Russia. On the         crowded  list  are  American  firms  Ford  and  GM’s  Chevrolet,  Japan’s  Toyota,  Suzuki,  Nissan,  Isuzu,  and          Mitsubishi, South Korea’s Kia, Hyundai and Daewoo, and European makers Renault, Volkswagen, Fiat and         BMW. Chinese carmakers like Chery, Great Wall, and SsangYong are also trying to head into Russia.                   Doubtlessly, the foreign carmakers’ rush into Russia is promoting this country’s car industry as the          government expected. Currently, assembly of foreign models alone has attracted significant investment over         $2 billion in the first stage. And investment plans already announced suggest that new capacity could reach         1.6m units by 2012. However, foreign carmakers’ expansion on the Russian market is at the expense of          Russian ones.                   In 1990 Russian carmakers built 1.2 million passenger vehicles, but in 2007 they sold just 756,000.          AvtoVAZ, which makes more than 90 percent of the Russian-brand passenger cars, is still selling its Ladas         in  provincial  Russia  because  of  its  low  price,  the  large  number  of  dealers,  and  few  alternatives  there.         Currently, the main threat to Lada comes from very cheap Chinese cars and the possible change in the used-          car  business  policy.  Although  so  far  the  likes  of  Chery  and  Great  Wall  from  China  haven’t  received         permissions from the Russian authorities to set up in Russia, such situation may not last long. And if as         expected the 18 percent VAT on used cars sold by dealers is abolished, Lada’s price advantage will vanish.          Now AvtoVAZ’s main hope lies in the 25 percent stake recently acquired by Renault for $1 billion. Based on         Renault platforms, the largest Russian carmaker is expecting to bring new Ladas to market by 2010.                   Another local producer, Severstal-Auto, has decided to focus on small vans and trucks rather than          taking on foreign car brands due to the potentially large demand from the fast growing retail sectors. Severstal         already has a joint venture with Fiat to produce its Albea and Linea saloons. In May 2008, the first Fiat Ducato          van  was  successfully  driven  off  the  firm’s  new  production  line  in  Elabuga,  a  ‘‘free  economic  zone’’  in         Tatarstan.  Severstal  also  makes  small  and  medium-sized  Isuzu  trucks.  Another  possible  section  of  this         company probably will be high-margin services—actually Severstal is as well thinking about building a dealer          network so as to sell services such as adapting vehicles for school and hospitals, providing full-service leasing         arrangements and offering credit terms with local banks.                                                                                                                                 2","CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY                    International Marketing                                                           Tanza                                                      CASE ANALYSIS          Case Study:  RUSSIA: A HUGE EMERGING CAR MARKET ISOLATED FROM OIL CRISIS          I.

According to the owner the name Kuya                          J was derived from the common Filipinos name such as; Jose, Jesus, James, and Jericho                         and he believes that Kuya J is the appropriate name because most Filipino families have                         a ‘J’ in their family, so he sees that Kuya J is very suitable for our restaurant.

We wanted it to represent  somebody who is a big                         brother and somebody who cares to do it right\".

In terms of managing the restaurant, Kuya J’s Restaurant is also facing incompetency. It                         has a poor service, serving of the food is too slow and some of these are half cooked or                         overcooked and it’s causing trouble for their strategies.

Industry Analysis                                A.  Industry features                                   The  food  industry  is  very  large,  and  if  food  production,  manufacturing,                                   marketing, restaurants and institutions are combined, it is the largest industrial                                   enterprise.  An  appreciation  of the  size,  components,  interrelationships, and                                   responsiveness  to  change  of  the  food  industry  enlarges  food  scientists’                                    understanding of the environment in which they operate.                                  B.  Industry Boundaries                                   From  the  word  boundary  itself  which  means  a  border  or  a  limit,  industry                                   boundaries could be defined as the point at which industries ends or beyond                                   which it becomes something else. This means that industry boundaries are the                                   demarcations between two distinct industries, and so it encompasses both the                                    supply and demand trajectories.                                   Understanding  the  industries  and  its  sectors  and  monitoring  the                                   macroeconomic  environment  are  the  two  main  objectives  of  industry                                   boundaries whereby organizational strategies are at the core of the business                                   conduct.                                   C.  Industry Environment                                   Restaurants and other food-service providers are so widespread that half of all                                   adults have worked in food service in one way or another at some point in their                                   lives. The food service industry encompasses any establishment that serves","17                                    food  to  people  outside  their  home.  This  includes  restaurants,  carryout                                   operations, cafeterias, university dining halls, catering and vending companies,                                   hotels and inns, and rehab and retirement centers.                                      This industry is divided into two groups: Those that prepare and serve food and                                   those that produce and distribute food, equipment, and services needed by                                   food providers. The most common example of the first group is restaurants.                                   Restaurants employ front of the house people and back of the house people.                                   The  former  includes  bartenders,  wait  staff,  hosts,  and  busboys.  The  latter                                    includes chefs, cooks, managers, and dishwashers. Fast food restaurants limit                                   their staff to food preparation people, managers, and cashiers. The trend of                                   food trucks adds a mobile component to food service and requires just a few                                   people to drive the truck, cook the food, and serve it through a window.                                  D.  Industry Structure                                   Foodservice establishments are projected to capture 53 percent of consumers’                                    food  expenditures,  whereas  in  1980,  foodservice  captured  less  than  40                                   percent. The foodservice industry accounts for approximately 4 percent of the                                   Gross  Domestic  Product  and  about  11  million  jobs.  It  has  been  rapidly                                   changing  due  to  economic  factors,  technological  advances,  and  labor                                   matters.1 This overview covers many of the issues and trends affecting the                                    different segments of the foodservice supply chain including the foodservice                                   operators,  distributors  and  food  manufacturers.  Changing  customer                                   demographics are a driving force in the evolution of the foodservice industry.                                   As the baby boomers reach middle age, they do not seem to have time to cook                                   and their children and grandchildren do not seem to have the interest, or talent.","18                                   E.

Food and beverage service is the essential link between the customers and                                   the menu,  beverages  and  other  services  on  offer  in  an  establishment. The                                   server  is  the  main  point  of  contact  between  the  customers  and  the                                   establishment  and  plays  an  important  role  in  a  profession  with  increasing                                   national and international status.

Industry Performance                                   A performance appraisal for customer service expectations is more than simply                                   evaluating employees on whether they greet customers with a smile or whether                                   managers effectively resolve conflicts with suppliers who fail to provide high-                                   quality food products for use in their restaurants. Performance appraisals for                                   customer service in the F\&B world delve deeper into duties such as how to                                    ensure each restaurant patron has an enjoyable dining experience or the ability                                   for  a  bartender  to  take  off  his  mixologist  hat  and  make  the  transition  to                                   psychologist and confidante for a customer who stops in to have a cocktail after                                   a stressful day in the office.

STRATEGIC FOCUS                   I. Vision Statement                          Marikina Shoe Exchange vision is to be at the top of direct selling company in the                 Philippines  and  have  branches  nationwide.

Also, competing globally and offer high standards for the customers committed to why they                 want to offer in the market.                            b.  Desirability                      The vision desirability shows in the statement envision of being top in the direct- selling                  industry and being globally competitive business. It clearly define the company’s where they","5                  heading in the future. Thus, desirability of MSE company maybe a little vague and for short                 term  plan  of  the  company.  Desirability  of  vision  must  attract  future  investment  and                 stakeholders of the company, it challenge the competitors more.

Actionability                      MSE  company  actionability  to  their  vision  is  the  motivation  to  move  ahead  and  the                 success in the industry are but suddenly in today’s time they’re gradually failing. An action to                 achieve  the  vision  is  vital  to  the  company  because  it  leads  to  success  in  the  future  and                  prevent loss. Nowadays, MSE direct selling is vulnerable to the public presence.                            d.  Articulation                       Articulation of MSE company vision is concrete that they want to be top direct selling in                 the  Philippines,  have  branches  nationwide,  and  compete  globally  offering  high  standard                 products.  However,  visualized  larger  market  size  and  desirable  to  reach  globally  as  a                 successful company is not bad, to achieve vision it can be challenging but feasible.                         B.

The  characteristic  of  vision  statement  is                 precisely  envision.  However,  it  can  be  changed  to  attract  and  appeal  to  the  present  and                 future investors and stakeholders. The strength of their vision statement is very specific that                 they want to be on top and globally competitor in direct selling industry. The only weakness                  of their vision statement is it very narrow and unattractive to many people and it doesn’t state                 the action they will do to achieve the vision.                         C. Proposed Changes in the Vision Statement                      The  vision  statement  is  vital  to  the  company  because  it  provided  specific  achievable                 plan in a long-run of the company. It should have defined direction of plan and execution.                 The  changes  can  do  by  MSE  company  in  their  vision  statement  is  to  aim  long  and  wide                 characteristic  with  concrete  plan  to  execute  a  strategy  for  the  company.

MSE  company  vision  statement  should  be  a  top                 network  dealers  known  nationwide  and  globally  competitive  company.  The  proposed                 changes  of  the  vision  statement  is  the  MSE  company  is  an  direct-  selling  company  that                  offers Filipino made products.

The company is committed to continuously                 produce quality with reasonable price.                          A. Components of Mission Statement                      The components of mission statement of MSE are to provide high quality product, give                 satisfaction  and  continuously  produce  reasonable  price  to  the  customers.

B. Characteristic of Mission Statement                      The Marikina Shoe Exchange is a customer-oriented mission that aims to provide high                 quality products and give satisfaction in every customers. MSE provides clear purpose that                 is incredibly important to work in the future. On the other hand, MSE doesn't include other                 components but this mission is inspiring and enduring.                         C. Evaluation of Mission Statement                       The  firms  mission  focused  on  the  purpose  of  providing  satisfaction  to  the  customers                 need and wants of kids, men and women, especially to provide quality and long-lasting shoe                 for all.

Strengths and Weaknesses of Mission Statement                          Like  other  firms,  MSE  also  has  its  own  strengths.  First,  they  provide  high  quality                 products. Next, they give satisfaction to customers. Next, they provide reasoble price. Then,                 their mission is concerned with survival, growth and profitability. And finally, their products                 were originally made in the Philippines.                      The MSE also has its weaknesses. They do not include components like where the firm                 competes.  And  the  products  are  made  only  in  the  Philippines,  but  there  are  some  cities                 where MSE is not popular.","8                          E. Proposed Changes in the Mission Statement                       MSE  mission  statement  must  have  changes  like  in  its  own  mission,  this  need  to  be                 improved and be short but completely include other components. The business world today                 is changing, so MSE should take the trend like an e-commerce and change its promotion.                  The proposed mission statement is, to produce and promote high quality Filipino products to                 the customers and contribute the growth in the country.","9                  III.

Industry Analysis                     A.  Industry Features                             Features of the shoe industry in the Philippines, the core of which is located in                     Marikina City in the northeast of the Manila Metropolitan Area. Initial discussions delve                     with general remarks on industrial clusters and commodity chains with a detailed account                     of their internal structure and changing fortunes. The deeply-rooted failures of the cluster                     since the early 1990s are pinpointed. These can be directly related to the liberalization of                      the Filipino economy, and the concomitant increase in Chinese-made shoes on domestic                     markets. Various private and public responses to the crisis are described and evaluated.                     It is argued that as helpful as many of these responses may be, their overall impact is                     likely to remain limited. Series of possible policy options and their high risks of failure are                     emphasized.  In  conclusion,  the  study  presents  a  developmental  scenario  based  on                     cluster upgrading and intensified export activity.                     B.
