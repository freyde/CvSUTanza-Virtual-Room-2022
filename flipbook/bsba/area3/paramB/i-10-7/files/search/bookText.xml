                    4.1 COURSE SITE

                    A Course Site is an area where a teacher  can add resources and activities intended for students,
                    which is shown in Figure 15. It might be a simple page with downloadable documents, or it might be
                    a complex set of tasks where learning progresses through interaction.

                    The course page is made up of central sections which contain the tasks and (if desired) blocks to the
                    side. The course teacher has control over the layout of the course homepage and he/she can change
                    it at any time. Progress can be tracked in a number of ways.

                         4.1.2.2 HOW TO ADD AN ACTIVITY OR RESOURCE

                         Activity, such as Assignments or Quizzes, properly means that students can contribute directly
                         to  the  course,  and  is  often  contrasted  to  a  Resource,  such  as  a  File  or  Folder,  which  is
                         presented by the teacher as course modules.


                         For instance, if you want to upload documents or presentation, you would use File or Folders
                         or URL if you have a link to a website. Whereas, the Activity, students might submit their work
                         using an Assignment or they might contribute to Forum discussion.

                         There are fourteen (14) different types of activities in the standard course site that can be
                         found when the editing is turned on and the link 'Add an activity or resource' is clicked. These
                         are as follows:

                                    Chat              This  allows  teacher  and  students  to  have  a  real-time
                                                      synchronous discussion.


                                   Choice             This allows a teacher to ask a question and to include
                                                      multiple choice responses.

                                  Glossary            It enables participants to create and maintain a list of
                                                      definitions, like a dictionary.

               1.     State the meaning, nature and importance of strategic management;

               2.     Explain the dimensions and benefits of strategic management;

               3.     Identify the risks involved in strategic management; and

               4.     Discuss the strategic management process.


          I. INTRODUCTION


               If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of hundred battles. If you know

        yourself but the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy
        nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle – Sun Tzu


               Strategic Management is exciting and challenging. It makes fundamental decisions about the future
        direction of a firm – its purpose, its resources and how it interacts with the environment in which it operates.
        Every aspect of the organization plays a role in strategy – its people, its finances, its production methods, its

        customers and so on.
               Strategic Management can be described as the identification of the purpose of the organization and
        the plans and actions to achieve that purpose. It is that set of managerial decisions and actions that determine

        the long-term performance of a business enterprise. It involves formulating and implementing strategies that
        will  help  in  aligning  the  organization  and  its  environment  to  achieve  organizational  goals.  Strategic

        management does not replace the traditional management activities such as planning, organizing, leading or
        controlling. Rather, it integrates them into a broader context taking into account the external environment and
        internal  capabilities  and  the  organization’s  overall  purpose  and  direction.  Thus,  strategic  management

        involves those management processes in organizations through which future impact of change is determined
        and current decisions are taken to reach a desired future. In short, strategic management is about envisioning

        the future and realizing it.

           II. DEFINITION OF STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT


               We have so far discussed the concepts of strategic thinking, strategic decision-making and strategic
        approach which, it is hoped, will serve as an a background understand the nature of strategic management.

        However,  to  get  an  understanding  of  what  goes  on  in  strategic  management,  it  is  useful  to  begin  with
        definitions of strategic management. Later in the unit, we introduce the elements and the process of strategic
        management and the importance, benefits and limitations of strategic management.

               As already mentioned, the concepts in strategic management have been developed by a number of
        authors like Alfred Chandler, Kenneth Andrews, Igor Ansoff, William Glueck, Henry Mintzberg, Michael E.
        Porter, Peter Drucker and a host of others. There are therefore several definitions of strategic management.

        Some of the important definitions are:
               “Strategic management is concerned with the determination of the basic long-term goals and the

        objectives of an enterprise, and the adoption of courses of action and allocation of resources necessary for
        carrying out these goals”.
                                                                                       – Alfred Chandler, 1962

                “Strategic management is a stream of decisions and actions which lead to the development of an
        effective strategy or strategies to help achieve corporate objectives”.
                                                                                        – Glueck and Jauch, 1984

                “Strategic management is a process of formulating, implementing and evaluating cross-functional
        decisions that enable an organization to achieve its objective”.
                                                                                               – Fed R David, 1997

               “Strategic  management  is  the  set  of  decisions  and  actions  resulting  in  the  formulation  and
        implementation of plans designed to achieve a company’s objectives.”

                                                                                    – Pearce and Robinson, 1988
               “Strategic  management  includes  understanding  the  strategic  position  of  an  organization,  making
        strategic choices for the future and turning strategy into action.”

                                                                                      – Johnson and Sholes, 2002
               “Strategic management consists of the analysis, decisions, and actions an organization undertakes

        in order to create and sustain competitive advantages.”
                                                                                     – Dess, Lumpkin & Taylor, 2005











                                                                                                                2]]></page><page Index="86"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                                                    Tanza Campus

               We observe from the above definitions that different authors have defined strategic management in
        different ways. Note that the definition of Chandler that we have quoted above is from the early 1960s, the
        period when strategic management was being recognized as a separate discipline. This definition consists

        of three basic elements:
            1.  Determination of long-term goals
            2.  Adoption of courses of action

            3.  Allocation of resources to achieve those goals
               Though this definition  is simple, it does not consist of all the elements and does not capture the
        essence of strategic management.

               The definitions of Fred R. David, Pearce and Robinson, Johnson and Sholes and Dell, Lumpkin and
        Taylor  are  some  of the definitions  of recent  origin. Taken together, these  definitions  capture three main

        elements that go to the heart of strategic management. The three on-going processes are strategic analysis,
        strategic  formulation  and  strategic  implementation.  These  three  components  parallel  the  processes  of
        analysis, decisions and actions. That is, strategic management is basically concerned with:

            1.  Analysis of strategic goals (vision, mission and objectives) along with the analysis of the external and
               internal environment of the organization.

            2.  Decisions about two basic questions:
                   (a)    What businesses should we compete in?
                   (b)    How should we compete in those businesses to implement strategies?

            3.  Actions to implement strategies. This requires leaders to allocate the necessary resources and to
               design the organization to bring the intended strategies to reality. This also involves evaluation and
               control to ensure that the strategies are effectively implemented.

               The real strategic challenge to managers is to decide on strategies that provide competitive advantage
        which can be sustained over time. This is the essence of strategic management, and Dess, Lumpkin and
        Taylor have rightly captured this element in their definition.


          III. NATURE OF STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT



               Strategic  Management  can  be  defined  as  the  art  &  science  of  formulating,  implementing,  and
        evaluating,  cross-functional  decisions  that  enable  an  organization  to  achieve  its  objectives.  Strategic

        management is different in nature from other aspects of management. An individual manager is most often
        required to deal with problems of operational nature. He generally focuses on day-to-day problems such as
        the efficient production of goods, the management of a sales force, the monitoring of financial performance

        or the design of some new system that will improve the level of customer service.
               Strategic management involves elements geared toward a firm's long term survival and achievement
        of management goals. The components of the content of a strategy making process include a desirable

        future,  resource  allocation,  management  of  the  firm-environment  and  a  competitive  business  ethics.

                                                                                                                3]]></page><page Index="87"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                                                    Tanza Campus

        However, some conflicts may result in defining the content of strategy such as differences in interaction
        patterns among associates, inadequacy of available resources and conflicts between the firm's objectives
        and its environment.


           IV. DIMENSIONS OF STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT


        The characteristics of strategic management are as follows:
                   1.  Top management involvement: Strategic management relates to several areas of a firm’s
                       operations.  So,  it  requires  top  management’s  involvement.  Generally,  only  the  top

                       management has the perspective needed to understand the broad implications of its decisions
                       and the power to authorize the necessary resource allocations.

                   2.  Requirement of large amounts of resources: Strategic management requires commitment
                       of the firm to actions over an extended period of time. So they require substantial resources,
                       such as, physical assets, money, manpower etc.

                              Example:  Decisions  to  expand  geographically  would  have  significant  financial
                       implications in terms of the need to build and support a new customer base.
                   3.  Affect  the  firm’s  long-term  prosperity:  Once  a  firm  has  committed  itself  to  a  particular

                       strategy,  its  image  and  competitive  advantage  are  tied  to  that  strategy;  its  prosperity  is
                       dependent upon such a strategy for a long time.
                   4.  Future-oriented: Strategic management encompasses forecasts, what is anticipated by the

                       managers. In such decisions, emphasis is placed on the development of projections that will
                       enable the firm to select the most promising strategic options. In the turbulent environment, a

                       firm will succeed only if it takes a proactive stance towards change.
                   5.  Multi-functional  or  multi-business  consequences:  Strategic  management  has  complex
                       implications for most areas of the firm. They impact various strategic business units especially

                       in areas relating to customer-mix, competitive focus, organizational structure etc. All these
                       areas will be affected by allocations or reallocations of responsibilities and resources that

                       result from these decisions.
                   6.  Non-self-generative decisions: While strategic management may involve making decisions
                       relatively  infrequently,  the  organization  must  have  the  preparedness  to  make  strategic

                       decisions at any point of time. That is why Ansoff calls them “non-self-generative decisions.”

                                                    Tanza Campus


           V. NEED FOR STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT


               No business firm can afford to travel in a haphazard manner. It has to travel with the support of some
        route map. Strategic management provides the route map for the firm. It makes it possible for the firm to take
        decisions concerning the future with a greater awareness of their implications. It provides direction to the

        company; it indicates how growth could be achieved.
               The external environment influences the management practices within any  organization. Strategy
        links the organization to this external world. Changes in these external forces create both opportunities and

        threats  to  an  organization’s  position  –  but  above  all,  they  create  uncertainty.  Strategic  planning  offers  a
        systematic means of coping with uncertainty and adapting to change. It enables managers to consider how

        to grasp opportunities and avoid problems, to establish and coordinate appropriate courses of action and to
        set targets for achievement.
               Thirdly,  strategic  management  helps  to  formulate  better  strategies  through  the  use  of  a  more

        systematic, logical and rational approach. Through involvement in the process, managers and employees
        become  committed  to  supporting  the  organization.  The  process  is  a  learning,  helping,  educating  and

        supporting activity. An increasing number of firms are using strategic management for the following reasons:
        1.  It helps the firm to be more proactive than reactive in shaping its own future.
        2.  It provides the roadmap for the firm. It helps the firm utilize its resources in the best possible manner.

        3.  It allows the firm to anticipate change and be prepared to manage it.
        4.  It helps the firm to respond to environmental changes in a better way.
        5.  It minimizes the chances of mistakes and unpleasant surprises.

        6.  It provides clear objectives and direction for employees.


          VI. BENEFITS OF STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT


            “We are tackling 20-year problems with five-year plans staffed with two-year personnel funded by

        one–year appropriations”.
                                                                                       – Harlan Cleveland
               The above quotation sums up why today’s decision-makers must plan and manage strategically. In

        developing as well as in industrialized countries, the increasingly rapid nature of change as well as a greater
        openness in the political and economic environments, requires a different set of perspective from that needed
        during more stable times.

               When a certain degree of equilibrium existed in the environment, as during the 1950s, with constant
        positive economic growth, low debt, manageable budgets and relative environmental stability, managers
        could concentrate almost exclusively on the internal dimensions of their organizations and assume constancy




                                                                                                                5]]></page><page Index="89"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                                                    Tanza Campus

        in the external environment. Forward calculations were simple, inputs were predictable, and planning was
        mostly an arithmetic exercise.
               Now, systems are much more open, environment is characterized by increasingly unstable economic

        growth, budgets are constantly revised, inputs are thoroughly unpredictable, and planning in the traditional
        sense is no longer tenable.
               Therefore,  today’s  enterprises  need  strategic  management  to  reap  the  benefits  of  business

        opportunities, overcome the threats and stay ahead in the race. The purpose of strategic management is to
        exploit and create new and different opportunities for tomorrow; while long- term planning, in contrast, tries
        to optimize for tomorrow the trends of today.

               Today, all top companies are involved in strategic management. They are finding ways to respond to
        competitors, cope with difficult environmental changes, meet changing customer needs and effectively use

        available resources. At a time when the business environment is changing rapidly, even established firms
        are  paying  more  attention  to  strategy  because  they  may  face  new  competitors  who  threaten  their  core
        business. Should a firm compete in all areas or concentrate on one area? Should a company try to extend

        the brand to even more diverse areas of activity, or would it gain more by building profits in the existing areas,
        and achieving more synergies across the group? Should the company continue the current strategy as it is

        now, or would it initiate a radical review of its strategy? These are just a few examples of the strategic part of
        the management tasks.
               It is important to note that strategic planning goes far beyond the planning process. Unlike traditional

        planning, strategic planning involves a long-range planning under conditions of uncertainty and complexity.
        Such a planning involves:
               1.  Strategic thinking

               2.  Strategic decision-making
               3.  Strategic approach


            A structured approach to strategy planning brings several benefits (Smith, 1995; Robbins, 2000)
            1.  It reduces uncertainty: Planning forces managers to look ahead, anticipate change and develop

               appropriate responses. It also encourages managers to consider the risks associated with alternative
               responses or options.
            2.  It provides a link between long and short terms: Planning establishes a means of coordination

               between strategic objectives and the operational activities that support the objectives.
            3.  It facilitates control: By setting out the organization’s overall strategic objectives and ensuring that
               these are replicated at operational level, planning helps departments to move in the same direction

               towards the same set of goals.
            4.  It facilitates measurement: By setting out objectives and standards, planning provides a basis for
               measuring actual performance.



                                                                                                                6]]></page><page Index="90"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY

            Strategic management has thus both financial and non-financial benefits:
               1. Financial Benefits: Research indicates that organizations that engage in strategic management
        are more profitable and successful than those that do not. Businesses that followed strategic management

        concepts  have  shown  significant  improvements  in  sales,  profitability  and  productivity  compared  to  firms
        without systematic planning activities.
               2. Non-financial benefits: Besides financial benefits, strategic management offers other intangible

        benefits to a firm. They are:
                   a.  Enhanced awareness of external threats
                   b.  Improved understanding of competitors’ strategies

                   c.  Reduced resistance to change
                   d.  Clearer understanding of performance-reward relationship

                   e.  Enhanced problem-prevention capabilities of organization
                   f.  Increased interaction among managers at all divisional and functional levels
                   g.  Increased order and discipline.

               According to Gordon Greenley, strategic management offers the following benefits:
                   1.  It allows for identification, prioritization and exploitation of opportunities.

                   2.  It provides objective view of management problems.
                   3.  It provides a framework for improved coordination and control of activities.
                   4.  It minimizes the effects of adverse conditions and changes.

                   5.  It allows decision-making to support established objectives.
                   6.  It allows more effective allocation of time and resources to identified opportunities.
                   7.  It allows fewer resources and less time to be devoted to correcting erroneous and ad hoc

                   decisions.
                   8.  It creates a framework for internal communication among personnel.
                   9.  It helps integrate the behaviour of individuals into a total effort.

                   10. It provides a basis for clarifying individual responsibilities.
                   11. It encourages forward thinking.

                   12. It  provides  a  cooperative,  integrated  enthusiastic  approach  to  tackling  problems  and
                       opportunities.
                   13. It encourages a favorable attitude towards change.

                   14. It gives a degree of discipline and formality to the management of a business.

          VII. RISKS INVOLVED IN STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT


               Strategic management is an intricate and complex process that takes an organization into unchartered
        territory. It does not provide a ready-to-use prescription for success. Instead, it takes the organization through
        a journey and offers a framework for addressing questions and solving problems.




                                                                                                                7]]></page><page Index="91"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                                                    Tanza Campus

               Strategic management is not, therefore, a guarantee for success; it can be dysfunctional if conducted
        haphazardly. The following are its limitations:
               1.  It is a costly exercise in terms of the time that needs to be devoted to it by managers. The negative

                   effect of managers spending time away from their normal tasks may be quite serious.
               2.  A  negative  effect  may  arise  due  to  the  non-fulfillment  of  the  expectations  of  the  participating
                   managers, leading to frustration and disappointment.

               3.  Another  negative  effect  of  strategic  management  may  arise  if  those  associated  with  the
                   formulation  of  strategy  are  not  intimately  involved  in  the  implementation  of  strategies.  The
                   participants in formulation of the policy may shirk their responsibility for the decisions taken.

               As quoted by Fred R. David, some pitfalls to watch for and avoid in strategic planning are:
               1.  Using strategic planning to control over decisions and resources

               2.  Doing strategic planning only to satisfy accreditation or regulatory requirements
               3.  Moving too hastily from mission development to strategy formulation
               4.  Failing to communicate the strategic plan to the employees, who continue working in the dark

               5.  Top managers making many intuitive decisions that conflict with the formal plan
               6.  Top managers not actively supporting the strategic planning process

               7.  Failing to use plans as a standard for measuring performance
               8.  Delegating strategic planning to a consultant rather than involving all managers
               9.  Failing to involve key employees in all phases of planning

               10. Failing to create a collaborative climate supportive of change
               11. Viewing planning to be unnecessary or unimportant
               12. Becoming so engrossed in current problems that insufficient or no planning is done

               13. Being so formal in planning that flexibility and creativity are stifled.



           VIII. STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT PROCESS


               Developing  an  organizational  strategy  involves  four  main  elements  –  strategic  analysis,  strategic
        choice, strategy implementation and strategy evaluation and control. Each of these contains further steps,
        corresponding to a series of decisions and actions, that form the basis of strategic management process.

               1.  Strategic  Analysis:  The  foundation  of  strategy  is  a  definition  of  organizational  purpose.  This
        defines the business of an organization and what type of organization it wants to be. Many organizations
        develop broad statements of purpose, in the form of vision and mission statements. These form the spring –

        boards for the development of more specific objectives and the choice of strategies to achieve them.
        Environmental  analysis  –  assessing  both  the  external  and  internal  environments  is  the  next  step  in  the
        strategy process. Managers need to assess the opportunities and threats of the external environment in the

        light of the organization’s strengths and weaknesses keeping in view the expectations of the stakeholders.

                                                                                                                8]]></page><page Index="92"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                                                    Tanza Campus

        This analysis allows the organization to set more specific goals or objectives which might specify where
        people are expected to focus their efforts. With a more specific set of objectives in hand, managers can then
        plan how to achieve them.

               2. Strategic Choice: The analysis stage provides the basis for strategic choice. It allows managers
        to consider what the organization could do given the mission, environment and capabilities – a choice which
        also reflects the values of managers and other stakeholders. (Dobson et al. 2004). These choices are about

        the overall scope and direction of the business.
        Since managers usually face several strategic options, they often need to analyze these in terms of their
        feasibility, suitability and acceptability before finally deciding on their direction.

               3.  Strategy  Implementation:  Implementation  depends  on  ensuring  that  the  organization  has  a
        suitable structure, the right resources and competencies (skills, finance, technology etc.), right leadership

        and culture. Strategy implementation depends on operational factors being put into place.
               4.  Strategy  Evaluation  and  Control:  Organizations  set  up  appropriate  monitoring  and  control
        systems, develop standards and targets to judge performance.

           Week      CASE STUDY: Planning for the Chevy Volt

             2


                  General Motors is a company in deep trouble. As car sales in North America collapsed in 2008,

        GM, which had already lost money in 2007, plunged deeply into the red. With losses estimated at $14 billion,
        the company was forced to go cap in hand to the government to beg for public funds to help it stave off

        bankruptcy. Fearing the economic consequences of a collapse of GM, the government agreed to loan funds
        to GM, but it insisted that the company have a clear plan charting its way back to profitability. Ironically, such
        a plan was already in place at GM. At the heart of it was a potentially huge gamble on a new type of car: the

        Chevy Volt.
                  The Chevy Volt, which was introduced in 2010, is a compact, four- door electric car with a reserve

        gasoline-powered engine. The primary power source is a large lithium ion battery (lithium ion batteries are
        typically found in small electric appliances such as cell phones). The battery can be charged by plugging it
        into a wall socket for 6 hours; when fully charged, it will fuel the car for 40 miles, which is less than most

        people’s daily commute. After that, a gasoline engine kicks in, providing both drive power and recharging the
        lithium  ion  battery. GM  estimated fuel  economy  will  be  over  100 miles per  gallon,  and  charging  the  car
        overnight from a power outlet would cost about 80% less than filling it with gas at $3 per gallon. The car will

        have a starting cost of around $41,000; however, because it uses a battery- powered technology, buyers will
        be able to take $7,500 tax credit.
                  The Volt was the brainchild of two men, Bob Lutz, GM’s vice- chairman, and Larry Burns, the head

        of  Research  &  Development  and  strategic  planning  at  GM.  Although  Lutz  in  particular  had  always
        championed large gas- hungry muscle cars, GM’s planning told them that the market would probably move

        away from the SUVs that had been a profitable staple at GM for most of the 1990s. A number of trends were
        coming together to make this scenario likely.
                  First, oil prices, and by extension, gas prices, were increasing sharply. Although driving an SUV

        that gets 12 miles to the gallon might make economic sense when gas was priced at $1 a gallon, it did not

                                                                                                              10]]></page><page Index="94"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                                                    Tanza Campus

        for most people when gas was $4 per gallon. GM’s planning suggested that due to growing  demand in
        developed nations, including China and India, and limited new supplies, the days of cheap oil were over.
        Second, global warming was becoming an increasing concern, and it seemed possible that tighter regulations

        designed to limit carbon emissions would be introduced in the future. As a major source of greenhouses
        gases, such as carbon dioxide, automobiles powered by internal combustion engines could hardly escape
        this  trend.  Third,  the  cost  of  manufacturing  lithium  ion  batteries  was  falling,  and  new  technology  was

        promising to make them more powerful. Finally, GM’s major competitor, Toyota, with its best-selling hybrid,
        the Prius, had demonstrated that there was demand for fuel- efficient cars that utilized new battery technology
        (the Prius, however, uses a conventional fuel cell as opposed to a lithium ion battery).

                  Despite  their  analysis,  when  Lutz  and  Burns  first  proposed  making  the  Volt  in  2003,  other
        managers at GM beat them down. For one thing, GM had already invested billions in developing fuel cells,

        and many in the company did not want to suddenly switch gears and focus on lithium ion batteries instead.
        Besides, said the critics, technologically it would be difficult to produce a large lithium ion battery. Others
        were skeptical given that GM had already had one failure with an electric car, the ill- fated EV1 introduced in

        the 1990s. Powered by a fuel cell, the EV1 had not sold well (according to many because the company had
        not put its weight behind it).

                  By 2006, however, the tide had started to turn. Not only were oil prices surging, as predicted by
        the strategic planning group, but also a small Silicon Valley start- up, Telsa Motors, had announced that it
        would be bringing a lithium ion sports car to market. Lutz’s reaction was, “if a start- up can do it, GM can too!”

        So Lutz and Burns formed a skunk works within GM and quickly put together a Chevy Volt concept car, which
        they unveiled at the 2007 Detroit auto show. The concept car gained a lot of positive feedback, and Lutz used
        this to argue within the company that GM needed to commit to the project. Moreover, he argued, Toyota was

        gaining major benefits from its Prius, both in terms of sales and the halo effect associated with making a
        green car. This time Lutz and Burns were able to persuade other senior managers to back the project, and it
        was officially launched in early 2007 with an aggressive goal of market introduction in 2010.

          I. INTRODUCTION


               Strategy  formulation  is  the  process  of  determining  appropriate  courses  of  action  for  achieving

        organizational objectives and thereby accomplishing organizational purpose.
               Strategy formulation is vital to the well-being of a company or organization. It produces a clear set
        of recommendations, with supporting justification, that revise as necessary the mission and objectives of the

        organization, and supply the strategies for accomplishing them. In formulation, we are trying to modify the
        current objectives and strategies in ways to make the organization more successful. This includes trying to

        create "sustainable" competitive advantages – although most competitive advantages are eroded steadily
        by the efforts of competitors.
               A  good  recommendation  should  be:  effective  in  solving  the  stated  problem(s),  practical  (can  be

        implemented in this situation, with the resources available), feasible within a reasonable time frame, cost-
        effective, not overly disruptive, and acceptable to key "stakeholders" in the organization. It is important to
        consider "fits"  between resources  plus  competencies  with  opportunities,  and  also fits  between  risks  and

        expectations.
               There are four primary steps in this phase:

                   2.  Identifying  a  rich  range  of  strategic  alternatives  to  address  the  three  levels  of  strategy
                       formulation outlined below, including but not limited to dealing with the critical issues.
                   3.  Doing a balanced evaluation of advantages and disadvantages of the alternatives relative to

                       their feasibility plus expected effects on the issues and contributions to the success of the
                       organization.
                   4.  Deciding on the alternatives that should be implemented or recommended.

               In organizations, and in the practice of strategic management, strategies must be implemented to
        achieve the intended results. Here it has to be remembered that the most wonderful strategy in the history of
        the world is useless if not implemented successfully.


           II. ASPECTS OF STRATEGY FORMULATION



               The following three aspects or levels of strategy formulation, each with a different focus, need to be

        dealt with in the formulation phase of strategic management. The three sets of recommendations must be
        internally consistent and fit together in a mutually supportive manner that forms an integrated hierarchy of
        strategy, in the order given.

            1.  Corporate Level Strategy
            2.  Competitive Strategy
            3.  Functional Strategy

        Let us understand each of them one by one.
               1. Corporate Level Strategy: In this aspect of strategy, we are concerned with broad decisions about
        total organization's scope and direction. Basically, we consider what changes should be made in our growth

        objective and strategy for achieving it, the lines of business we are in, and how these lines of business fit
        together. It is useful to think of three components of corporate level strategy:

            a)  Growth or directional strategy (what should be our growth objective, ranging from retrenchment
               through stability to varying degrees of growth - and how do we accomplish this)
            b)  Portfolio  strategy  (what  should  be  our  portfolio  of  lines  of  business,  which  implicitly  requires

               reconsidering how much concentration or diversification we should have), and
            c)  Parenting strategy (how we allocate resources and manage capabilities and activities across the

               portfolio – where do we put special emphasis, and how much do we integrate our various lines of
               business).
               2. Competitive Strategy: It is quite often called as Business Level Strategy. This involves

        deciding how the company will compete within each Line of Business (LOB) or Strategic Business
        Unit  (SBU).  In  this  second  aspect  of  a  company's  strategy,  the  focus  is  on  how  to  compete

        successfully in each of the lines of business the company has chosen to engage in. The central

        thrust  is  how  to  build  and  improve  the  company's  competitive  position  for  each  of  its  lines  of
        business. A company has competitive advantage whenever it can attract customers and defend

                                                                                                              13]]></page><page Index="97"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                                                    Tanza Campus

        against competitive forces better than its rivals. Companies want to develop competitive advantages
        that  have  some  sustainability  (although  the  typical  term  "sustainable  competitive  advantage"  is

        usually  only  true  dynamically,  as  a  firm  works  to  continue  it).  Successful competitive  strategies
        usually involve building uniquely strong or distinctive competencies in one or several areas crucial

        to success and using them to maintain a competitive edge over rivals. Some examples of distinctive
        competencies are superior technology and/or product features, better manufacturing technology and

        skills, superior sales and distribution capabilities, and better customer service and convenience.

               3. Functional Strategy: These more localized and shorter-horizon strategies deal with how
        each functional area and unit will carry out its functional activities to be effective and maximize

        resource productivity. Functional strategies are relatively short-term activities that each functional
        area within a company  will carry out to implement the broader, longer-term corporate level and

        business level strategies. Each functional area has a number of strategy choices, that interact with
        and must be consistent with the overall company strategies.

               Three  basic  characteristics  distinguish  functional  strategies  from  corporate  level  and

        business  level  strategies:  shorter  time  horizon,  greater  specificity,  and  primary  involvement  of
        operating managers.

               A few examples follow of functional strategy topics for the major functional areas of marketing,

        finance,  production/operations,  research  and  development, and  human  resources management.
        Each area needs to deal with sourcing strategy, i.e., what should be done in-house and what should

        be outsourced?
               Marketing strategy deals with product/service choices and features, pricing strategy, markets

        to be targeted, distribution, and promotion considerations. Financial strategies include decisions
        about  capital acquisition,  capital allocation, dividend  policy,  and  investment  and  working  capital

        management. The production or operations functional strategies address choices about how and

        where  the  products  or  services  will  be  manufactured  or  delivered,  technology  to  be  used,
        management of resources, plus purchasing and relationships with suppliers. For firms in high-tech

        industries, R&D strategy may be so central that many of the decisions will be made at the business
        or even corporate level, for example the role of technology in the company's competitive strategy,

        including choices between being a technology leader or follower. However, there will remain more
        specific decisions that are part of R&D functional strategy, such as the relative emphasis between

        product and process R&D, how new technology will be obtained (internal development vs. external

        through  purchasing, acquisition,  licensing,  alliances,  etc.),  and degree  of  centralization for R&D
        activities. Human resources functional strategy includes many topics, typically recommended by the

        human resources department, but many requiring top management approval.

                                                                                                              14]]></page><page Index="98"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY

          III. BUSINESS VISION



               The first task in the process of strategic management is to formulate the organization’s vision and
        mission statements. These statements define the organizational purpose of a firm. Together with objectives,
        they form a “hierarchy of goals.”

                                         Figure 2.1:  Hierarchy  of  Goals
















               A clear vision helps in developing a mission statement, which in turn facilitates setting of objectives
        of the firm after analyzing external and internal environment. Though vision, mission and objectives together

        reflect the “strategic intent” of the firm, they have their distinctive characteristics and play important roles in
        strategic management.
               Vision can be defined as “a mental image of a possible and desirable future state of the organization”

        (Bennis and Nanus). It is “a vividly descriptive image of what a company wants to become in future”. Vision
        represents top management’s aspirations about the company’s direction and focus. Every organization needs

        to develop a organization of the future. A clearly articulated vision molds organizational identity, stimulates
        managers in a positive way and prepares the company for the future.
               “The critical point is that a vision articulates a view of a realistic, credible, attractive future for the

        organization, a condition that is better in some important ways than what now exists.”
               Vision, therefore, not only serves as a backdrop for the development of the purpose and strategy of
        a firm, but also motivates the firm’s employees to achieve it.

               According to Collins and Porras, a well-conceived vision consists of two major components:
               1.      Core ideology
               2.      Envisioned future

               Core ideology is based on the enduring values of the organization (“what we stand for and why we
        exists”), which remain unaffected by environmental changes. Envisioned future consists of a long-term goal

        (what we aspire to become, to achieve, to create”) which demands significant change and progress.

                                                    Tanza Campus


           IV. DEFINING VISION


               Vision has been defined in several different ways. Richard Lynch defines vision as “ a challenging
        and imaginative picture of the future role and objectives of an organization, significantly going beyond its
        current environment and competitive position.” E1-Namaki defines it as “a mental perception of the kind of

        environment that an organization aspires to create within a broad time horizon and the underlying conditions
        for the actualization of this perception”. Kotter defines it as “a description of something (an  organization,
        corporate culture, a business, a technology, an activity) in the future.”

               Organizational  Vision.  Most  refer  to  a  future  or  ideal  to  which  organizational  efforts  should  be
        directed. The vision itself is presented as a picture or image that serves as a guide or goal. Depending on

        the definition, it is referred to as inspiring, motivating, emotional and analytical. For Boal and Hooijberg,
        effective visions have two components:
               1.      A cognitive component (which focuses on outcomes and how to achieve them)

               2.      An affective component (which helps to motivate people and gain their commitment to it)

                                                  Definitions of  Vision

                      1.   Johnson:  Vision  is  "clear  mental picture  of  a  future  goal  created jointly  by  a
                           group for the benefit of other people, which is capable of inspiring and motivating
                           those whose support is necessary for its achievement".

                      2.   Kirkpatrick et al: Vision is "an ideal that represents or reflects the shared values to
                           which the organization should aspire".
                      3.   Thornberry: Vision is "a picture or view of the future. Something not yet real, but
                           imagined. What the organization could and should look like. Part analytical and
                           part  emotional".

                      4.   Shoemaker: Vision is "the shared understanding of what the firm should be and
                           how it must change".

                      5.   Kanter et al: Vision is "a picture of a destination aspired to, an end state to  be
                           achieved via the change. It reflects the larger goal needed to keep in mind while
                           concentrating on concrete daily activities".

                      6.   Stace and Dunphy: Vision is "an ambition about the future, articulated today, it is a
                           process of managing the present from a stretching view of the future".



           V. NATURE OF VISION


               A vision represents an animating dream about the future of the firm. By its nature, it is hazy and vague.
        That is why Collins describes it as a “Big hairy audacious goal” (BHAG). Yet it is a powerful motivator to

        action. It captures both the minds and hearts of people. It articulates a view of a realistic, credible, attractive
        future for the organization, which is better than what now exists. Developing and implementing a vision is one
        of the leader’s central roles. He should not only have a “strong sense of vision”, but also a “plan” to implement

        it.

                                                                                                              16]]></page><page Index="100"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY

             1.   Henry Ford’s vision of a “car in every garage” had power. It captured the imagination of others and
                  aided internal efforts to mobilize resources and make it a reality. A good vision always needs to be
                  a bit beyond a company’s reach, but progress towards the vision is what unifies the efforts of

                  company personnel.
             2.   One of the most famous examples of a vision is that of Disneyland “To be the happiest place on
                  earth”. Other examples are:

               (a) Hindustan Lever: Our vision is to meet the everyday needs of people everywhere.
               (b) Microsoft: Empower people through great software any time, any place and on any device.
               (c)  Britannia Industries: Every third Indian must be a Britannia consumer.

               (d) A Coke within arm's reach of everyone on the planet (Coca Cola)
               (e) Encircle Caterpillar (Komatsu)

               (f)  Become the Premier Company in the World (Motorola)
               (g) Put a man on the moon by the end of the decade (John F. Kennedy, April 1961)
               (h) Eliminate what annoys our bankers and customers (Texas Commerce Bank)

               (i)  The one others copy (Mobil)



          VI. CHARACTERISTICS OF VISION STATEMENTS


               As may be seen from the above definitions, many of the characteristics of vision given by these

        authors are common such as being clear, desirable, challenging, feasible and easy to communicate. Nutt
        and  Backoff  have  identified  four  generic  features  of  visions  that  are  likely  to  enhance  organizational
        performance:

            1.  Possibility  means  the  vision  should  entail  innovative  possibilities  for  dramatic  organizational
               improvements.
            2.  Desirability means the extent to which it draws upon shared organizational norms and values about

               the way things should be done.
            3.  Actionability means the ability of people to see in the vision, actions that they can take that are

               relevant to them.
            4.  Articulation means that the vision has imagery that is powerful enough to communicate clearly a
               picture of where the organization is headed.

               According  to  Thompson  and  Strickland,  some  important  characteristics  of  an  effective  vision
        statement are:
            1.  It must be easily communicable: Everybody should be able to understand it clearly.

            2.  It must be graphic: It must paint a picture of the kind of company the management is trying to create.
            3.  It must be directional: It must say something about the company’s journey or destination.
            4.  It must be feasible: It must be something which the company can reasonably expect to achieve in due

               course of time.

                                                                                                              17]]></page><page Index="101"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY

            5.  It must be focused: It must be specific enough to provide managers with guidance in making decisions.
            6.  It must be appealing to the long term interests of the stakeholders.
            7.  It must be flexible: It must allow company’s future path to change as events unfold and circumstances

               change.

          VII. IMPORTANCE OF VISION




               Having a strategic vision is linked to competitive advantage, enhancing organizational performance,
        and achieving sustained organizational growth. Clear vision enable firms to determine how well organizational
        leaders are performing and to identify gaps between the vision and current practices. Organizations preparing

        for transformational change regularly undertake “envisioning” exercises to help guide them into the future.
        The visioning process itself can enhance the self-esteem of the people who participate in it because they can
        see the potential fruits of their labors.

               Conversely, a “lack of vision” is associated with organizational decline and failure. As Beaver argues
        “Unless companies have clear vision about how they are going to be distinctly different and unique in adding

        and satisfying their customers, they are likely to be the corporate failure statistics of tomorrow”. Lacking vision
        is used to explain why companies fail to build their core competencies despite having access to adequate
        resources to do so. Business strategies that lack visionary content may fail to identify when change is needed.

        Lack of an adequate process for translating shared vision into collective action is associated with the failure
        to produce transformational organizational change.

               Thus vision statements serve as:
                   a.  A basis for performance: A vision creates a mental picture of an organization’s path and
                       direction in the minds of people in the organization and motivates them for high performance.
                   b.  Reflects core values: A vision is generally built around core values of an organization, and

                       channelizes the group’s energies towards such values and serves as a guide to action.
                   c.  Way  to  communicate:  A  vision  statement  is  an  exercise  in  communication.  A  well-

                       communicated vision statement will bring the employees together and galvanize them into
                       action.
                   d.  A desirable challenge: A vision provides a desirable challenge for both senior and junior

                       managers.
               While providing a sense of direction, strategic vision also serves as a kind of “emotional commitment”.

        Thompson and Strickland point out the significance of “vision” which is broadly as follows:
               1.      It crystallizes top management’s own view about firm’s long-term direction.
               2.      It reduces the risk of rudderless decision-making.

               3.      It serves as a tool for maximizing the support of organization members for internal changes.
               4.      It serves as a “beacon” to guide managers in decision-making.
               5.      It helps the organization to prepare for the future.

               Vision poses a challenge and addresses the human need for something to strive for. It can depict an
        image of the future that is both attractive and worthwhile.
               Indeed, developing a strategic vision may be regarded as a managerial imperative in the strategic

        management process. This is because strategic management presupposes the necessity to look beyond

                                                                                                              19]]></page><page Index="103"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY

        today, to anticipate the impact of new technology, changes in customer needs and market opportunities.
        Creating  a  well-conceived  vision  illuminates  an  organization’s  direction  and  purpose,  and  then  using  it
        repeatedly as a reminder of “where we are headed and why” helps keep organization members on the chosen

        path.

           VIII. ADVANTAGES OF VISION


               Several advantages accrue to an organization having a vision. Parikh and Neubauer point out the
        following advantages:

                   1.     Good vision fosters long-term thinking.
                   2.     It creates a common identity and a shared sense of purpose.

                   3.     It is inspiring and exhilarating.
                   4.     It represents a discontinuity, a step function and a jump ahead so that the company knows
                          what it is to be. It fosters risk-taking and experimentation.

                   5.     A good vision is competitive, original and unique. It makes sense in the market place.
                   6.     A good vision represents integrity. It is truly genuine and can be used for the benefit of

                          people.
                   A vision may fail when it is:
                   1.  Too specific (fails to contain a degree of uncertainty)

                   2.  Too vague (fails to act as a landmark)
                   3.  Too inadequate (only partially addresses the problem)
                   4.  Too unrealistic (perceived as unachievable)

               A.D. Jick observes that a vision is also likely to fail when leaders spend 90 percent of their time
        articulating it to their staff and only 10 percent of their time in implementing it. There are two other reasons
        for vision failure:

                   1.  Adaptability of vision over time
                   2.  Presence of competing visions


          IX. FORMULATING A VISION STATEMENT


               Generally, in most cases, vision is inherited from the founder of the organization who creates a vision.
        Otherwise, some of the senior strategists in the organization formulate the vision statement as a part of
        strategic planning exercise.

               Nutt and Backoff identify three different processes for crafting a vision:
            1.  Leader-dominated  Approach:  The  CEO  provides  the  strategic  vision  for  the  organization.  This
               approach is criticized because it is against the philosophy of empowerment, which maintains that

               people across the organization should be involved in processes and decisions that affect them.

                                                                                                              20]]></page><page Index="104"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                                                    Tanza Campus

            2.  Pump-priming Approach: The CEO provides visionary ideas and selects people and groups within
               the organization to further develop those ideas within the broad parameters set out by the CEO.
            3.  Facilitation Approach: It is a “co-creating approach” in which a wide range of people participate in

               the process of developing and articulating a vision. The CEO acts as a facilitator, orchestrating the
               crafting process. According to Nutt and Backoff, it is this approach that is likely to produce better
               visions  and  more  successful  organizational  change  and  performance  as  more  people  have

               contributed to its development and will therefore be more willing to act in accordance with it.
            While the above frameworks identify the extent to which there is involvement throughout the organization
        in the development of the vision, they do not address the specifics on how to develop the actual vision itself.

        Some routines for producing vision are outlined in the Table.

          X. DEFINING MISSION


               Thompson defines mission as “The essential purpose of the organization, concerning particularly why
        it is in existence, the nature of the business it is in, and the customers it seeks to serve and satisfy”. Hunger
        and Wheelen simply call the mission as the “purpose or reason for the organization’s existence”.

               A mission can be defined as a sentence describing a company's function, markets and competitive
        advantages.  It  is  a  short  written  statement  of  your  business  goals  and  philosophies.  It  defines  what  an
        organization is, why it exists and its reason for being. At a minimum, a mission statement should define who

        are the primary customers of the company, identify the products and services it produces, and describe the
        geographical location in which it operates.

               Example:
                   1.     Ranboxy Petrochemicals: To become a research based global company.
                   2.     Reliance  Industries:  To  become  a  major  player  in  the  global  chemicals  business  and

                          simultaneously grow in other growth industries like infrastructure.
                   3.     ONGC:  To  stimulate,  continue  and  accelerate  efforts  to  develop  and  maximize  the

                          contribution of the energy sector to the economy of the country.
                   4.     Cadbury India: To attain leadership position in the confectionery market and achieve a
                          strong national presence in the food drinks sector.

                   5.     Hindustan  Lever:  Our  purpose  is  to  meet  everyday  needs  of  people  everywhere  –  to
                          anticipate the aspirations of our consumers and customers, and to respond creatively and
                          competitively with branded products and services which raise the quality of life.

                   6.     McDonald: To offer the customer fast food prepared in the same high quality worldwide,
                          tasty and reasonably priced, delivered in a consistent low key décor and friendly manner.
                   7.     Most of the above mission statements set the direction of the business organization by

                          identifying the key markets which they plan to serve.
               Missions have one or more of the five distinct and identifiable components:

                   1.  Customers
                   2.  Products or services
                   3.  Markets

                   4.  Concern for growth
                   5.  Philosophy








                                                                                                              22]]></page><page Index="106"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY

          XI. IMPORTANCE OF MISSION STATEMENT

               The purpose of the mission statement is to communicate to all the stakeholders inside and outside

        the organization what the company stands for and where it is headed. It is important to develop a mission
        statement for the following reasons:
               1.  It helps to ensure unanimity of purpose within the organization.

               2.  It provides a basis or standard for allocating organizational resources.
               3.  It establishes a general tone or organizational climate.
               4.  It serves as a focal point for individuals to identify with the organization’s purpose and direction.

               5.  It  facilitates  the  translation  of  objectives  into  tasks  assigned  to  responsible  people  within  the
                   organization.

               6.  It specifies organizational purpose and then helps to translate this purpose into objectives in such
                   a way that cost, time and performance parameters can be assessed and controlled.
               Developing a comprehensive mission statement is also important because divergent views among

        managers can be revealed and resolved through the process.
               According to Pearce (1982), vision and mission statements have the following value:

               1.  They provide managers with a unity of direction that transcends individual, parochial and transitory
                   needs.
               2.  They promote a sense of shared expectations among all levels and generations of employees.

               3.  They consolidate values over time and across individuals and interest groups. .
               4.  They  project  a  sense  of  worth  and  intent  that  can  be  identified  and  assimilated  by  company
                   outsiders.

               5.  Finally, they affirm the company’s commitment to responsible action, in order to preserve and
                   protect the essential claims of insiders for sustained survival, growth and profitability of the firm.



          XII. CHARACTERISTICS OF A MISSION STATEMENT


               A good mission statement should be short, clear and easy to understand. It should therefore possess
        the following characteristics:
            1.  Not lengthy: A mission statement should be brief.

            2.  Clearly articulated: It should be easy to understand so that the values, purposes, and goals of the
               organization are clear to everybody in the organization and will be a guide to them.
            3.  Broad, but not too general: A mission statement should achieve a fine balance between specificity

               and generality.
            4.  Inspiring:  A  mission  statement  should  motivate  readers  to  action.  Employees  should  find  it
               worthwhile working for such an organization.




                                                                                                              23]]></page><page Index="107"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                                                    Tanza Campus

            5.  It  should  arouse  positive  feelings  and  emotions  of  both  employees  and  outsiders  about  the
               organization.
            6.  Reflect  the  firm’s  worth:  A  mission  statement  should  generate  the  impression  that  the  firm  is

               successful, has direction and is worthy of support and investment.
            7.  Relevant: A mission statement should be appropriate to the organization in terms of its history, culture
               and shared values.

            8.  Current: A mission statement may become obsolete after some time. As Peter Drucker points out,
               “Very few mission statements have anything like a life expectancy of thirty, let alone, fifty years. To
               be good enough for ten years is probably all one can normally expect”. Changes in environmental

               factors and organizational factors may necessitate modification of the mission statement.
            9.  Unique: An organization’s mission statement should establish the individuality and uniqueness of the

               company.
            10. Enduring: A mission statement should continually guide and inspire the  pursuit of organizational
               goals. It may not be fully achieved, but it should be challenging for managers and employees of the

               organization.
            11. Dynamic: A mission statement should be dynamic in orientation allowing judgments about the most

               promising growth directions and the less promising ones.
            12. Basis  for  guidance:  Mission  statement  should  provide  useful  criteria  for  selecting  a  basis  for
               generating and screening strategic options.
            13. Customer orientation: A good mission statement identifies the utility of a firm’s products or services

               to its customers, and attracts customers to the firm.
            14.  A declaration of social policy: A mission statement should contain its philosophy about social

               responsibility including its obligations to the stakeholders and the society at large.
            15. Values, beliefs and philosophy: The mission statement should lay emphasis on the values the firm
               stands  for;  company  philosophy,  known  as  “company  creed”,  generally  accompanies  or  appears

               within the mission statement.



          XIII. FORMULATING A MISSION STATEMENT

               Mission  statements  may  vary  in  length,  content,  format  and  specificity.  But  most  agree  that  an

        effective mission statement must be comprehensive enough to include all the key components. Because a
        mission  statement  is  often  the  most  visible  and  public  part  of  the  strategic  management  process,  it  is
        important that it includes all the following essential components:

            1.     Basic product or service: What are the firm’s major products or services?
            2.     Primary markets: Where does the firm compete?
            3.     Principal technology: Is the firm technologically current?

            4.     Customers: Who are the firm’s customers?

                                                                                                              24]]></page><page Index="108"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                                                    Tanza Campus

            5.     Concern  for  survival,  growth  and  profitability:  Is  the  firm  committed  to  growth  and  financial
                   soundness?
            6.     Company philosophy: What are the basic beliefs, values, aspirations and ethical priorities of the

                   firm?
            7.     Company self-concept: What is the firm’s distinctive competence or major competitive advantage?
            8.     Concern  for  public  image:  Is  the  firm  responsive  to  social,  community  and  environmental

                   concerns?
            9.     Concern for employees: Are employers considered a valuable asset of the firm?
            10.    Concern for quality: Is the firm committed to highest quality?


        Products or Services, Markets and Technology

               An indispensable component of the mission statement is specification of the firm’s basic product or
        service, markets and technology. These three components describe the company’s activity.
        Survival, Growth and Profitability

               Every firm has to secure its survival through growth and profitability. These three economic goals
        guide the strategic direction of almost every business organization.

        A firm that is unable to survive will be incapable of satisfying the aims of any of its stakeholders. Profitability
        is the mainstay goal of a business organization, and profit over the long term is the clearest indication of a
        firm’s ability to satisfy the claims and desires of all stakeholders. A firm’s growth is inextricably linked to its

        survival and profitability.
        Company Philosophy
               The statement of a company’s philosophy (also called company creed) generally appears within the

        mission statement. It specifies the basic values, beliefs and aspirations to which the strategic decision-makers
        are  committed  in  managing  the  company.  The  company  philosophy  provides  a  distinctive  and  accurate
        picture of the company’s managerial outlook.

        Company Self-concept
               Both individuals and companies have a crucial need to know themselves. The ability of a company to

        survive  in  a  highly  competitive  environment  depends  on  its  realistic  evaluation  of  its  strengths  and
        weaknesses. Description of the firm’s self-concept provides a strong impression of the firm’s self-image.
        Public Image

               Mission statements should reflect the public expectations of the firm since this makes achievement of
        the firm’s goals more likely.
                Example: “Johnson & Johnson make safe products” reflects the customer expectations of the company

        in making safe products.
               Sometimes, a negative public image can be corrected by emphasizing the beneficial aspects in the
        mission statements.

                                                    Tanza Campus

        Concern for Employees
               Mission statements should also emphasize their concern for improvement of quality of work life, equal
        opportunity for all, measures for employee welfare etc.

        Customers
               “The customer is our top priority” is a slogan that would be claimed by most of the businesses the
        world over. A focus on customer satisfaction causes managers to realize the importance of providing an

        excellent customer service. So, many companies have made customer service a key component of their
        mission statement.
        Quality

               The emphasis on quality has received added importance in many corporate philosophies.



          XIV. FORMULATING A MISSION STATEMENT

               There  is  no  standard  method  for  formulating  mission  statements.  Different  firms  follow  different

        approaches. As indicated in the strategic management model, a clear mission statement is needed before
        alternative strategies can be formulated and implemented. It is important to involve as many managers as

        possible in the process of developing a mission statement, because through involvement, people become
        committed to the mission of the organization.
               Mission statements are generally formulated as follows:

               1.      In many cases, the mission is inherited i.e. the founder establishes the mission which may
                       remain unchanged down the years or may be modified as the conditions change.
               2.      In some cases, the mission statement is drawn up by the CEO and board of directors or a

                       committee  of  strategists  constituted  for  the  purpose.  Many  companies  hold  brainstorming
                       sessions of senior executives to develop a mission statement. Soliciting employee’s views is
                       also common.

               3.      According to Fred R. David, an ideal approach for developing a mission statement would be
                       to select several articles about mission statements and ask all managers to read these as

                       background  information. Then  ask managers to  prepare  a  draft mission  statement for the
                       organization. A facilitator or a committee of top managers, merge these statements into a
                       single document and distribute this draft mission statement to all managers. Then the mission

                       statement is finalized after taking inputs from all the managers in a meeting. Thus, the process
                       of  developing  a  mission  statement  represents  a  great  opportunity  for  strategists  to  obtain
                       needed support from all managers in the firm.

               4.      Decision on how best to communicate the mission to all managers, employees and external
                       constituencies of an organization are needed when the document is in its final form. Some
                       organizations  even  develop  a  videotape to  explain  the  mission  statement  and  how  it  was

                       developed.

                                                                                                              26]]></page><page Index="110"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                                                    Tanza Campus

               5.      The  practice  in  Indian  companies  appears  to  be  a  consultative-participative  route.  For
                       example,  at  Mahindra  and  Mahindra,  workshops  were  conducted  at  two  levels  within  the
                       organization with corporate planning group acting as facilitators. The State Bank of India went

                       one step ahead by inviting labour unions to partake in the exercise. Satyam Computers went
                       one more step ahead by involving their joint venture companies and overseas clients in the
                       process.


          XV. EVALUATING MISSION STATEMENTS

        For a mission statement to be effective, it should meet the following ten conditions:

            1.  The  mission  statement  is  clear  and  understandable  to  all  parties  involved.  The  organization  can
               articulate and relate to it.

            2.  The mission statement is brief enough for most people to remember.
            3.  The  mission  statement  clearly  specifies  the  purpose  of  the  organization.  This  includes  a  clear
               statement about:

                   (a) What needs the organization is attempting to fill (not what products or services are offered)?
                   (b) Who the organization's target populations are?

                   (c)  How the organization plans to go about its business; that is, what its primary technologies are?
            4.  The mission statement should have a primary focus on a single strategic thrust.
            5.  The mission statement should reflect the distinctive competence of the organization (e.g., what can it

               do best? What is its unique advantage?)
            6.  The mission statement should be broad enough to allow flexibility in implementation, but not so broad
               as to permit lack of focus.

            7.  The mission statement should serve as a template and be the same means by which the organization
               can make decisions.
            8.  The  mission  statement  must  reflect  the  values,  beliefs  and  philosophy  of  operations  of  the

               organization.
            9.  The mission statement should reflect attainable goals.

            10. The mission statement should be worked so as to serve as an energy source and rallying point for
               the organization (i.e., it should reflect commitment to the vision).
        Distinction between Vision and Mission


                           Vision                             Mission
             1.   A  mental  image of a  possible  and   1.   Enduring statement of philosophy, a
                 desirable future state of the      creed statement.
                 organization.
             2.   A dream.                      2.   The purpose or reason for a
                                                    firm’s existence.
             3.   Broad.                        3.   More specific than vision
             4.   Answers the question “what we want   4.   Answers the question “what is
                 to become?”                        our business”.

                                                                                                              27]]></page><page Index="111"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY

          XVI. CONCEPT OF GOALS AND OBJECTIVES



        Goals
               The terms “goals and objectives” are used in a variety of ways, sometimes in a conflicting sense.
        The  term  “goal”  is  often  used  interchangeably  with  the  term  “Objective”.  But  some  authors  prefer  to

        differentiate the two terms.
               A  goal  is  considered  to  be  an  open-ended  statement  of  what  one  wants  to  accomplish  with  no
        quantification  of  what  is  to  be  achieved  and  no  time  criteria  for  its  completion.  For  example,  a  simple

        statement of “increased profitability” is thus a goal, not an objective, because it does not state how much
        profit the firm wants to make. Objectives are the end results of planned activity. They state what is to be

        accomplished by when and should be quantified. For example, “increase profits by 10% over the last year”
        is an objective.
               As may be seen from the above, “goals” denote what an organization hopes to accomplish in a future

        period of time. They represent a future state or outcome of the effort put in now. “Objectives” are the ends
        that state specifically how the goals shall be achieved. In this sense, objectives make the goals operational.

        Objectives  are  concrete  and  specific  in  contrast  to  goals  which  are  generalized.  While  goals  may  be
        qualitative, objectives tend to be mainly quantitative, measurable and comparable.


                               Goals                              Objectives
                         1. General                           Specific

                         2. Qualitative                       Quantitative, measurable
                         3. Broad organization–wide target  Narrow targets set by operating

                                                              divisions
                         4. Long term results                 Immediate, short term results

               Some of the areas in which a company might establish its goals and objectives are:

                          1.     Profitability (net profit)
                          2.     Efficiency (low costs, etc)

                          3.     Growth (increase in sales etc)
                          4.     Shareholder wealth (dividends etc)
                          5.     Utilization of resources (return on investment)

                          6.     Market leadership (market share etc)

        Stated vs. Operational Goals
               Operational goals  are the  real goals  of  an  organization.  Stated goals  are the  official goals  of  an
        organization. Operational goals tell us what the organization is trying to do, irrespective of what the official

        goals say the aims are. Official goals generally reflect the basic philosophy of the company and are expressed
        in abstract terminology, for example, ‘sufficient profit’, ‘market leadership’ etc. According to Charles Perrow,
        the following are the important operational goals:

            1.  Environmental  Goals:  An  organization  should  be  responsive  to  the  broader  concerns  of  the
               communities  in  which  it  operates,  and  should  have  goals  that  satisfy  people  in  the  external
               environment. For example, goals like customer satisfaction and social responsibility may be important

               environmental goals.
            2.  Output Goals: Output goals are related to the identification of customer needs. Issues like what

               markets should we serve, which product lines should be followed, etc. are examples of output goals.
            3.  System Goals: These goals relate to the maintenance of the organization itself. Goals like growth,
               profitability, stability etc. are examples.

            4.  Product Goals: These goals relate to the nature of products delivered to customers. They define
               quantity, quality, variety, innovativeness of products.
            5.  Derived  Goals:  These  goals  relate  to  derived  or  secondary  areas  like  contribution  to  political

               activities, promoting social service institutions etc.

            Objectives

               Objectives are the results or outcomes an organization wants to achieve in pursuing its basic mission.
            The  basic  purpose  of  setting  objectives  is  to  convert  the  strategic  vision  and  mission  into  specific

            performance targets. Objectives function as yardsticks for tracking an organization’s performance and
            progress.
            Characteristics of Objectives

            Well – stated objectives should be:
            1.  Specific

            2.  Quantifiable
            3.  Measurable
            4.  Clear

            5.  Consistent
            6.  Reasonable
            7.  Challenging

            8.  Contain a deadline for achievement
            9.  Communicated, throughout the organization

            Role of Objectives
               Objectives play an important role in strategic management. They are essential for strategy formulation
            and implementation because:

            1.  They provide legitimacy
            2.  They state direction
            3.  They aid in evaluation

            4.  They create synergy
            5.  They reveal priorities
            6.  They focus coordination

            7.  They provide basis for resource allocation
            8.  They act as benchmarks for monitoring progress

            9.  They provide motivation
        Nature of Objectives
        The following are the characteristics of objectives:

        Hierarchy of Objectives
               In a multi – divisional firm, objectives should be established for the overall company as well as for

        each division.
               Objectives are generally established at the corporate, divisional and functional levels, and as such,
        they form a hierarchy. The zenith of the hierarchy is the mission of the organization. The objectives at each

        level contribute to the objectives at the next higher level.
        Long-range and Short-range Objectives
               Organizations  need  to  establish  both  long-range  and  short-range  objectives  (Long–range  means

        more than one year, and short–range means one year and less.) Short-range objectives spell out the near –
        term results to be achieved. By doing so, they indicate the speed and the level of performance aimed at each
        succeeding period. Short – range objectives can be identical to long– range objectives if an organization is

        performing at the targeted long-term level (for example, 20% growth - rate every year). The most important
        situation where short-range objectives differ from the long-range objectives occurs when managers cannot

        reach the long-range target in just one year, and are trying to elevate organizational performance. Short–
        range objectives (one – year goals) are the means for achieving long range objectives. A company that has
        an objective of doubling its sales within five  years can’t wait until the third or fourth year of its five-year

        strategic plan. Short range objectives then serve as stepping-stones or milestones.
        Multiplicity of Objectives
               Organizations pursue a number of objectives. At every level in the hierarchy, objectives are likely to

        be multiple.
                       Example: The marketing division may have the objective of sales and distribution of products.
        This objective can be broken down into a group of objectives for the product, distribution, research and

        promotion activities. To describe a single, specific goal of an organization is to say very little about it. It turns

                                                                                                              30]]></page><page Index="114"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY

        out that there are several goals involved. This may be due to the fact that the enterprise has to meet internal
        as well as external challenges effectively. Moreover, no single objective can place the organization on a path
        of prosperity and progress in the long run.

        Network of Objectives
               Objectives  form  an  interlocking  network.  They  are  inter-related  and  inter-dependent.  The
        implementation  of  one  may  impact  the  implementation  of  the  other.  If  there  is  no  consistency  between

        company objectives, people may pursue goals that may be good for their own function but detrimental to the
        company as a whole. Therefore, objectives should not only “fit” but also reinforce each other. As observed
        by Koontz et al., “it is bad enough when goals do not support and interlock with one another. It may be

        catastrophic when they interfere with one another.”

           Week      CASE STUDY: Formulating a Strategy: Following Apple Turnaround

             3


                  The firm's most important resources and capabilities are those which are durable, difficult to identify

        and  understand,  imperfect  transferable,  not  easily  replicated,  and  in  which  the  firm  possesses  clear
        ownership. These are the company's 'most important assets' and need to be protected; and they play a pivotal
        role in the competitive strategy which the company pursues. The essence of strategy formulation, then, is to

        design a strategy that makes the most effective use of these core resources and capabilities.
                  Consider, for example, the remarkable turnaround of Apple, the computer company behind the

        Macintosh computers, between 2000 to date. Fundamental was Steve Job's recognition that the company's
        sole durable, non-transferable, irreplaceable asset was Apple image and the loyalty that accompanied that
        image. In virtually every other area of competitive performance-production cost, quality, product and process

        technology, and global market scope-Apple was greatly inferior to its other rivals, such as IBM. Apple's only
        opportunity  for  survival  was  to  pursue  a  strategy  founded  upon  Apple's  image  advantage,  while

        simultaneously minimizing Apple' disadvantages in other capabilities. Apple' new marketing strategy involved
        extending the appeal of the Apple image of individuality from its traditional customer group (tech savvy,
        graphic designers) to more a general, young professional types. Protection of the Apple name by means of

        tougher controls over dealers was matched by wider exploitation of the Apple name through entry in other
        industries such as the portable music business.
                  Apple's share of the computer market went from 15% in 1985 to 4% in 2005 and lost around $700

        million in only three months in 1997. However, thanks to the iPod and to the Apple's iTunes music stores, its
        shares grew 90% between 2001 up until today, i.e. from a mere $7/share. Apple is today the premier provider
        of MP3 players. Designing strategy around the most critically important resources and capabilities may imply

        that the firm limits its strategic scope to those activities where it possesses a clear competitive advantage.
        The  principal  capabilities  of  Apple,  are  in  design  and  new  products  development;  it  lacked  both  the

        manufacturing capabilities to compete effectively in the world's computer market. Apple's turnaround from
        year 2000 followed it decision to specialize upon design and new product development.
                  The ability of a firm's resources and capabilities to support a sustainable competitive advantage is

        essential to the time frame of a firm's strategic planning process. If a company's resources and capabilities
        lack durability or are easily transferred or replicated, then the company must either adopt a strategy of short-
        term harvesting or it must invest in developing new sources of competitive advantage.

                  These considerations are critical for small technological start-ups where the speed of technological
        change may mean that innovations offer only temporary competitive advantage. The company must seek
        either to exploit its initial innovation before it is challenged by stronger, established rivals or other start-ups,

        or it must establish the technological capability for a continuing stream of innovations.

                                                                                                              32]]></page><page Index="116"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY

                  The main issue for Apple is to make sure that it takes advantage of this window of opportunity.
        Because there are tougher competitors down the road and the more money it makes, the more companies
        will enter the market making harder for Apple to sustain this new found competitive advantage.

                  In  industries  where  competitive  advantages  based  upon  differentiation  and  innovation  can  be
        imitated (such as financial services, retailing, fashion clothing, toys), firms have a brief window of opportunity
        during which to exploit their advantage before imitators erode it away. Under such circumstances firms must

        be concerned not with sustaining the existing advantages, but with creating the flexibility and responsiveness
        that permits them to create new advantages at a faster rate than the old advantages are being eroded by
        competition.

                                                     LESSON 3

                                             EXTERNAL ASSESSMENT





                Instructional Objectives


               Lesson 3 covers the WEEK 5 and 6 of the course syllabus. After the completion of the lesson,
               students will be able to:


               1.     Explain the concept of environment;

               2.     Discuss porter's five forces theory;

               3.     Explain the concept of industry analysis; and

               4.     Discuss environment scanning.


          I. CONCEPT OF ENVIRONMENT


               External assessment is a step where a firm identifies opportunities that could benefit it and threats

        that it should avoid. It includes monitoring, evaluating, and disseminating of information from the external and
        internal environments to key people within the corporation.
               Environment literally means the surroundings, external objects, influences or circumstances under

        which someone or something exists. The environment of any organization is “the aggregate of all conditions,
        events and influences that surround and affect it.” Davis, K, The Challenge of Business, (New York: McGraw

        Hill, 1975), p. 43.
               Environment refers to all external forces which have a bearing on the functioning of business. Jauch
        and Gluecke has defined environment as “The environment includes factors outside the firm which can lead

        to opportunities or a threat to the firm. Although there are many factors the most important of the sectors are
        socio-economic, technological, supplier, competitor and govt.”
               The relation between a business and an environment is  not a one way affair. The business also

        equally influences the external environment and can bring about changes in it. Powerful business lobbies for
        instance, actively work towards changing government policies. The business environment is not all about the
        economic environment but also about the social and political environment.

                                                    Tanza Campus


               Importance of Business Environment

                   1.  Environment  is  Complex:  The  environment  consists  of  a  number  of  factors,  events,
                       conditions and influences arising from different sources. All these interact with each other to
                       create new sets of influences.

                   2.  It is Dynamic: The environment by its very nature is a constantly changing one. The varied
                       influences operating upon it impart dynamism to it and cause it to continually change its shape
                       and character.

                   3.  Environment is multi -faceted: The same environmental trend can have different effects on
                       different industries. For instance, GATS is an opportunity for some companies but a threat for

                       others.
                   4.  It has a far-reaching impact: The environment has a far-reaching impact on organizations in
                       that the growth and profitability of an organization depends critically on the environment in

                       which it exists.
                   5.  Its impact on different firms with in the same industry differs: A change in environment

                       may  have  different  bearings  on  various  firms  operating  in  the  same  industry.  In  the
                       pharmaceutical industry in India, for instance, the impact of the new IPR (Intellectual Property
                       Rights) law will different for research-based pharmacy companies such as Ranbaxy and Dr.

                       Reddy’s Lab and will be different for smaller pharmacy companies.
                   6.  It may be an opportunity as well as a threat to expansion: Developments in the general
                       environment often provide opportunities for expansion in terms of both products and markets.

                   7.  Changes  in  the  environment  can  change  the  competitive  scenario:  General
                       environmental changes may alter the boundaries of an industry and change the nature of its
                       competition.

                   8.  Sometimes  developments  are  difficult  to  predict  with  any  degree  of  accuracy:
                       Macroeconomic  developments  such  as  interest  rate  fluctuations,  the  rate  of  inflation,  and

                       exchange rate variations are extremely difficult to predict on a medium or a long term basis.
                       On the other hand, some trends such as demographic and income levels can be easy to
                       forecast.


          II. PORTER’S FIVE FORCE ANALYSIS



               The Porter Five Forces analysis model first appeared in a Harvard Business School professor Michael
        E Porter published in Harvard Business Review in 1979. The publication of this paper has historically changed

        the understanding of strategy among enterprises, organizations, and even countries.



                                                                                                              35]]></page><page Index="119"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                                                    Tanza Campus


               A Five Forces analysis can help companies assess industry attractiveness, how trends will affect

        industry  competition,  which  industries  a  company  should  compete  in—and  how  companies  can  position
        themselves for success.


               Five Forces Analysis is a strategic tool designed to give a global overview, rather than a detailed
        business analysis technique. It helps review the strengths of a market position, based on five key forces.
        Thus, Five Forces works best when looking at an entire market sector, rather than your own business and a

        few competitors.


















                                                   Porter’s Five Forces Model


               The Five Forces model developed by Michnal E. Porter has been the most commonly used analytical
        tool for examining competitive environment. According to this model, the intensity of competition in an industry

        depends on five basic forces. These five forces are:
               1.      Threat of new entrants
               2.      Intensity of rivalry among existing competitors

               3.      Bargaining power of buyers
               4.      Bargaining power of suppliers

               5.      Threat of substitute products and services.
               1. The Threat of New Entrants: The first of Porter’s Five Forces model is the threat of new entrants.
        New entrants bring new capacity and often substantial resources to an industry with a desire to gain market

        share. Established companies already operating in an industry often attempt to discourage new entrants from
        entering the industry to protect their share of the market and profits. Particularly when big new entrants are
                                                                                                              36]]></page><page Index="120"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                                                    Tanza Campus


        diversifying from other markets into the industry, they can leverage existing capabilities and cash flows to

        shake up competition. Pepsi did this when it entered the bottled water industry, Microsoft did when it began
        to offer internet browsers, and Apple did when it entered the music distribution business.
               The threat of new entrants, therefore, puts a cap on the profit potential of an industry. When the threat

        is high, existing companies hold down their prices or boost investment to deter new competitors. And the
        threat of entry in an industry depends on the height of entry barriers (i.e. factors that make it costly for new
        entrants to enter industry) that are present and on the retaliation from the entrenched competitors. If entry

        barriers are low and newcomers expect little retaliation, the threat of entry is high and industry profits will be
        moderate. It is the threat of entry, not whether entry actually occurs, that holds down profitability.

               2. Barriers to entry: Entry barriers depend on the advantages that existing companies have relative
        to new entrants. There are seven major sources:
                   a)  Economies of scale: These are relative cost advantages associated with large volumes of

                       production that lower a company’s cost structure. The cost of product per unit declines as the
                       volume of production increases. This discourages new entrants to enter on a large scale. If

                       the new entrant decides to enter on a large-scale to obtain economies of scale, it has to bear
                       high risks associated with a large investment.
                   b)  Product differentiation: Brand loyalty is buyer’s preference for the differentiated products of

                       any  established  company.  Strong  brand  loyalty  makes  it  difficult  for  new  entrants  to  take
                       market share away from established companies. It reduces threat of entry because the task
                       of breaking down well-established customer preferences is too costly for them.

                   c)  Capital requirements: The need to invest large financial resources in order to compete can
                       deter new entrants. Capital may be necessary not only for fixed assets, but also to extend
                       customer credit, build inventories and fund start-up losses. The barrier is particularly great if

                       the capital is required for unrecoverable expenditure, such as up-front advertising or research
                       and development. While major corporations have the financial resources to invade almost any

                       industry, the capital requirements in certain fields limit the pool of likely entrants.
                   d)  Switching costs: Switching costs are the one-time costs that a customer has to bear to switch
                       from one product to another. When switching costs are high, customers can be locked up in

                       the existing product, even if new entrants offer a better product. Thus, the higher the switching
                       costs are, the higher is the barrier to entry. Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software is

                       an example of a product with very high switching costs. Once a company has installed SAP’s
                       ERP system, the cost of moving to a new vendor are astronomical.
                   e)  Access to distribution channels: The new entrant’s need to secure distribution channel for

                       the product can create a barrier to entry. The established companies have already tied up with
                       distribution channels. For example, a new food item may have to displace others from the
                                                                                                              37]]></page><page Index="121"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY

                       supermarket shelf via price breaks, promotions, intense selling efforts or some other means.

                       The more limited the wholesale or retail channels are, tougher will be the entry into an industry.
                       Sometimes, if the barrier is so high, a new entrant must create its own distribution channels
                       as Timex did in the watch industry in the 1950s.

                   f)  Government  policy:  Historically,  government  regulations  have  constituted  a  major  entry
                       barrier into many industries. The government can limit or even foreclose entry into industries,
                       with  such  controls  as  license  requirements  and  limits  on  access  to  raw  materials.  The

                       liberalization  policy  of  the  Indian  government  relating  to  deregulation,  delicensing  and
                       decontrol of prices opened up the economy to many new entrepreneurs.


               3.  Intensity  of  Rivalry  among  Competitors:  The  second  of  Porter’s  Five-Forces  model  is  the
        intensity of rivalry among established companies within an industry. Rivalry means the competitive struggle

        between  companies  in  an  industry  to  gain  market  share  from  each  other.  Firms  use  tactics  like  price
        discounting, advertising campaigns, new product introductions and increased customer service or warranties.

        Intense rivalry lowers prices and raises costs. It squeezes profits out of an industry. Thus, intense rivalry
        among established companies constitutes a strong threat to profitability. Alternatively, if rivalry is less intense,
        companies may have the opportunity to raise prices or reduce spending on advertising etc. which leads to

        higher level of industry profits.
               The intensity of rivalry is greatest under the following conditions:
                   a.  Numerous  competitors  or  equally  powerful  competitors:  When  there  are  many

                       competitors  in  an  industry  or  if  the  competitors  are  roughly  of  equal  size  and  power,  the
                       intensity of rivalry will be more. Any move by one firm is matched by an equal countermove.
                       In such situations rivals find it hard to avoid poaching business.

                   b.  Slow industry growth: Slow industry growth turns competition into fight because the only
                       path to growth is to take sales away from a competitor.

                   c.  High fixed but low marginal costs: This creates intense pressure for competitors to cut
                       prices below their average costs even close to their marginal costs, to steal customers.
                   d.  Lack  of  differentiation  or  switching  costs:  If  products  or  services  of  rivals  are  nearly

                       identical and there are few switching costs, this encourages competitors to cut prices to win
                       new customers. Years of airline price wars reflect these circumstances in that industry.

                   e.  Capacity augmentation in large increments: If the only way a manufacturer can increase
                       capacity is in a large increment, such as building a new plant, it will run that new plant at full
                       capacity  to  keep  its  unit  costs  low.  Such  capacity  additions  can  be  very  disruptive  to  the

                       supply/demand balance and cause the selling prices to fall throughout the industry.


                                                                                                              38]]></page><page Index="122"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                                                    Tanza Campus


                   f.  High exit barriers: Exit barriers keep a company from leaving the industry. Exit barriers can

                       be economic, strategic or emotional factors that keep firms competing even though they may
                       be earning low or negative returns on their investments. If exit barriers are high, companies
                       become locked up in a non-profitable industry where overall demand is static or declining.

                       Excess capacity remains in use, and the profitability of healthy competitors suffers as the sick
                       ones hang on.


               4. Bargaining power of buyers: The third of Porter’s five competitive forces is the bargaining power
        of buyers. Bargaining power of buyers refers to the ability of buyers to bargain down prices charged by firms

        in the industry or driving up the costs of the firm by demanding better product quality and service. By forcing
        lower prices and raising costs, powerful buyers can squeeze profits out of an industry. Thus, powerful buyers
        should be viewed as a threat. Alternatively, if buyers are in a weak bargaining position, the firm can raise

        prices, cut costs on quality and services and increase their profit levels. Buyers are powerful if they have
        more  negotiation  leverage  than  the  firms  in  the  industry,  using  their  clout  primarily  to  pressure  price

        reductions. According to Porter, buyers are most powerful under the following conditions:
                          a.  There are few buyers: If there are few buyers or each one does bulk purchases, then
                   they  have  more  bargaining  power.  Large  buyers  are  particularly  powerful  in  industries  like

                   telecommunication equipment, off-shore drilling, and bulk chemicals. High fixed costs and low
                   marginal costs increase the pressure on rivals to keep capacity filling through discounts.
                          b.  The products are standard or undifferentiated: If the products purchased from the

                   firm are standard or undifferentiated, the buyers can easily find alternative sources of supplies.
                   Then buyers can play one company against the other, as in commodity grain markets.
                          c.  The buyer faces low switching costs: Switching costs lock the buyer to a particular

                   firm. If switching costs are low, buyers can easily switch from one firm’s product to another.
                          d.  The buyer earns low profits: If the buyer is under pressure to trim its purchasing

                   costs, the buyer is price sensitive and bargains more.
                          e.  The quality of buyer’s products: If the quality of buyer’s product is little affected by
                   industry’s products, buyers are more price sensitive.

               5.  Bargaining  power  of  suppliers:  The  fourth  of  Porter’s  Five  Forces  model  is  the
        bargaining power of suppliers. Suppliers are companies that supply raw materials, components,

        equipment, machinery and associated products. Powerful suppliers make more profits by charging
        higher  prices,  limiting  quality  or  services  or  shifting  the  costs  to  industry  participants.  Powerful

        suppliers squeeze profits out of an industry and thus, they are a threat. For example, Microsoft has




                                                                                                              39]]></page><page Index="123"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                                                    Tanza Campus


        contributed to the erosion of profitability among PC makers by raising prices on operating systems.

        PC makers, competing fiercely for customers, have limited freedom to raise their prices accordingly.

               A supplier’s bargaining power will be high under the following conditions:
                   a.  Few suppliers: When the supplier group is dominated by few companies and is more

                       concentrated than the firms to whom it sells, an industry is called concentrated. The
                       suppliers can then dictate prices, quality and terms.

                   b.  Product  is  differentiated:  When  suppliers  offer  products  that  are  unique  or
                       differentiated  or  built-up  switching  costs,  it  cuts  off  the  firm’s  options  to  play  one

                       supplier against the other. For example, pharmaceutical companies that offer patented

                       drugs with distinctive medical benefits have more power over hospitals, drug buyers
                       etc.

                   c.  Dependence of supplier group on the firm: When suppliers sell to several firms and
                       the firm does not represent a significant fraction of its sales, suppliers are prone to

                       exert  power.  In  other  words,  the  supplier  group  does  not  depend  heavily  on  the
                       industry for revenues. Suppliers serving many industries will not hesitate to extract

                       maximum profits from each one. If a particular industry accounts for a large portion of

                       a supplier group’s volume or profit, however, suppliers will want to protect the industry
                       through reasonable pricing.

                   d.  Importance of the product of the firm: When the product is an important input to the

                       firm’s  business  or  when  such  inputs  are  important  to  the  success  of  a  firm’s
                       manufacturing process or product quality, the bargaining power of suppliers is high.

                   e.  Lack of substitutes: The power of even large, powerful suppliers can be checked if
                       they compete with substitutes. But, if they are not obliged to compete with substitutes

                       as they are not readily available, the suppliers can exert power.


               5. Threat of substitute products: The fifth of Porter’s Five Forces model is the threat of

        substitute products. A substitute performs the same or a similar function as an industry’s product.
        Video  conferences  are  a  substitute  for  travel.  Plastic  is  a  substitute  for  aluminum.  E-mail  is  a

        substitute  for  a  mail.  All  firms  within  an  industry  compete  with  industries  producing  substitute
        products. For example, companies in the coffee industry compete indirectly with those in the tea

        and soft drink industries because all these serve the same need of the customer for refreshment.



                                                                                                              40]]></page><page Index="124"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                                                    Tanza Campus


               The existence of close substitutes is a strong competitive threat because this limits the price

        that companies in one industry can charge for their product. If the price of coffee rises too much

        relative to that of tea or soft drink, coffee drinkers may switch to those substitutes. Thus, according
        to Porter, “substitutes limit the potential returns of an industry by placing a ceiling on the prices firms

        in the industry can profitably charge”. For example, the price of tea puts a ceiling on the price of
        coffee. To  the extent that  switching  costs  are  low,  substitutes may  have  a  strong  effect  on  the

        profitability of an industry.
               The more attractive is the price/performance ratio of substitute products, the more likely they

        affect an industry’s profits. In other words, when the threat of substitutes is high, industry profitability

        suffers. If an industry does not ward off the substitutes through product performance, marketing,
        price  or  other  means,  it  will  suffer  in  terms  of  profitability  and  growth  potential  in  the  following

        circumstances:
            a.  It offers an attractive price and performance: The better the relative value of the substitute,

               the worse is the profit potential of the industry. For example, long distance telephone service
               providers suffered with the advent of Internet-based phone services.

            b.  The  buyer’s  switching  costs  to  the  substitutes  is  low:  For  example,  switching  from  a

               proprietary, branded drug to a generic drug usually involves minimum switching costs.

          III. INDUSTRY ANALYSIS


            Each business operates among a group of firms that produce competing products or services known as

        an “industry”. An industry is thus a group of firms producing similar products or services. By similar products
        we mean products that customers perceive to be substitutes for one another.
            Although there are usually some differences among competitors, each industry has its own set of “rules

        of  combat”  governing  such  issues  as  product  quality,  pricing  and  distribution.  This  is  especially  true  in
        industries that contain a large number of firms offering standardized products and services. As such, it is

        important for strategic managers to understand the structure of the industry in which their firms operate before
        deciding how to compete successfully. Industry analysis is therefore a critical step in the strategic analysis of
        a firm.

            In a perfect world, each firm would operate in one clearly defined industry. However, many firms compete
        in multiple industries, and strategic managers in similar firms often differ in their conceptualization of the

        industry environment. In addition, the advent of Internet has completely changed the way business is done.



                                                                                                              41]]></page><page Index="125"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                                                    Tanza Campus


        As  a  result,  the  process  of  industry  definition  and  analysis  can  be  specially  challenging  when  internet

        competition is considered.
            The basic purpose of industry analysis is to assess the strengths and weaknesses of a firm relative to its
        competitors in the industry. It tries to highlight the structural realities of particular industry and the extent of

        competition within that industry. Through industry analysis, an organization can find whether the chosen field
        is attractive or not and assess its own position within the industry.


            Industry Analysis


            1.  Industry Features: Industries differ significantly. So, analyzing a company’s industry begins with
        identifying the industry’s dominant economic features and forming a picture of the industry landscape. An
        industry’s dominant economic features include such factors as:

            (a) Overall size
            (b) Market growth rate

            (c)  Geographic boundaries of the market
            (d) Number and sizes of competitors
            (e) Pace of technological change

            (f)  Product innovations etc.
            Getting a handle on an industry features promotes understanding of the kinds of strategic moves that
        managers should employ. For example, in industries characterized by one product advance after another, a

        strategy of continuous product innovation becomes a condition for survival.
                    Example: Video games, computers and pharmaceuticals.
            2.  Industry Boundaries: All the firms in the industry are not similar to one another. Firms within the

        same industry could differ across various parameters, such as:
            (a) Breadth of market

            (b) Product/service quality
            (c)  Geographic distribution
            (d) Level of vertical integration

            (e) Profit motives
            3.  Industry Environment: Based on their environment, industries are basically of two types:

            (a) Fragmented Industries: A fragmented industry consists of a large number of small or medium-sized
        companies,  none  of  which  is  in  a  position  to  determine  industry  price.  Many  fragmented  industries  are
        characterized by low entry barriers and commodity type products that are hard to differentiate.

            (b) Consolidated  Industries:  A  consolidated  industry  is  dominated  by  a  small  number  of  large
        companies (an oligopoly) or in extreme cases, by just one company (a monopoly). These companies are in
                                                                                                              42]]></page><page Index="126"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                                                    Tanza Campus


        a position to determine industry prices. In consolidated industries, one company’s competitive actions or

        moves directly affect the market share of its rivals, and thus their profitability. When one company cuts prices,
        the competitors also cut prices. Rivalry increases as companies attempt to undercut each other’s prices or
        offer customers more value in their products, pushing industry profits down in the process. The consequence

        is a dangerous competitive spiral.
            4. Industry Structure: Defining an industry’s boundaries is incomplete without an understanding of its
        structural attributes. Structural attributes are the enduring characteristics that give an industry its distinctive

        character.
            Industry structure consists of four elements:

               (a) Concentration: It means the extent to which industry sales are dominated by only a few firms. In a
        highly concentrated industry (i.e. an industry whose sales are dominated by a handful of firms), the intensity
        of competition declines over time. High concentration serves as a barrier to entry into an industry, because it

        enables the firms to hold large market shares to achieve significant economies of scale.
               (b) Economies of scale: This is an important determinant of competition in an industry. Firms that

        enjoy economies of scale can charge lower prices than their competitors, because of their savings in per unit
        cost of production. They also can create barriers to entry by reducing their prices temporarily or permanently
        to deter new firms from entering the industry.

               (c) Product differentiation: Real perceived differentiation often intensifies competition among existing
        firms.
               (d) Barriers to entry: Barriers to entry are the obstacles that a firm must overcome to enter an industry,

        and the competition from new entrants depends mostly on entry barriers.
               5. Industry attractiveness: Industry attractiveness is dependent on the following factors:
               (a) Profit potential

               (b) Growth prospects
               (c) Competition

               (d) Industry barriers etc.
               As a general proposition, if an industry’s profit prospects are above average, the industry can be
        considered attractive; if its profit prospects are below average, it is considered unattractive. If the industry

        and competitive situation is assessed as attractive, firms employ strategies to expand sales and invest in
        additional facilities as needed to strengthen their long-term competitive position in business. If the industry is

        judged as unattractive, firms may choose to invest cautiously, look for ways to protect their profitability. Strong
        companies may  consider  diversification  into more  attractive  businesses. Weak  companies may consider
        merging with a rival to bolster market share and profitability.

               6. Industry performance: This requires an examination of data relating to:
               (a) Production
                                                                                                              43]]></page><page Index="127"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                                                    Tanza Campus


               (b) Sales

               (c) Profitability
               (d) Technological advancements etc.
               7. Industry practices: Industry practices refer to what a majority of players in the industry do with

        respect to products, pricing, promotion, distribution etc. This aspect involves issues relating to:
               (a) Product policy
               (b) Pricing policy

               (c) Promotion policy
               (d) Distribution policy

               (e) R&D policy
               (f) Competitive tactics.
               8. Industry’s future prospects: The future outlook of an industry can be anticipated based on such

        factors as:
               (a) Innovation in products and services

        Competitive Analysis
               The degree of competition in an industry is influenced by a number of forces. To establish a strategic

        agenda for dealing with these forces and grow despite them, a firm must understand:
               1. How these forces work in an industry?
               2. How they affect the firm in its particular situation?

               The essence of strategy formulation is coping with competition. Intense competition in an industry is
        neither a coincidence nor a bad luck. It is rooted in its underlying economics. There are two theories of

        economics – theory of monopoly and theory of perfect competition. These represent two extremes of industry
        competition. In a monopoly context, a single firm is protected by barriers to entry, and has an opportunity to
        appropriate all the profits generated in the industry.

               In a “perfectly competitive” industry, competition is unbridled and entry to the industry is easy. This
        kind of industry structure, of course, offers the worst prospects for long-run profitability. The weaker the forces

        collectively, however, the greater the opportunity for superior performance in terms of profit.
               According to Porter, “each industry’s attractiveness or profitability potential is a direct function of the
        interactions of various environmental forces that determine the nature of competition”.

               Buyers,  suppliers,  new  entrants  and  substitute  products  are  all  competitive  forces.  The  state  of

        competition in an industry is shaped by these forces. The collective strength of these forces determines the
        ultimate profit potential of an industry. It ranges from intense in certain industries to mild in certain industries.
               Whatever their collective strength, the corporate strategist’s goal is to find a position in the industry

        where his or her company can best defend itself against these forces or can influence them in its favor. The
        strategist must delve below the surface and analyze the underlying sources of competition. Knowledge of
        these underlying sources of competition helps:

               1.      To provide the groundwork for a strategic agenda.
               2.      To highlight the competitive strengths and weaknesses of the company.

               3.      To animate the positioning of the company in its industry.
               4.      To clarify the areas where strategic changes may yield the greatest payoff and
               5.      To  highlight  the  sources  of  greatest  significance,  either  as  opportunity  or  thereat.

        Understanding these sources will also help in considering areas for diversification.
               The strongest competitive forces determine the profitability of an industry; so, competitive analysis is

        of crucial importance in strategy formulation.

           IV. ENVIRONMENTAL SCANNING


               Environmental analysis or scanning is the process of monitoring the events and evaluating trends in
        the external environment, to identify both present and future opportunities and threats that may influence the

        firm’s ability to reach its goals. Strategists need to analyze a variety of different components of the external
        environment,  identify  “Key  Players”  within  those  domains,  and  be  very  cognizant  of  both  threats  and
        opportunities  within  the  environment.  It  is  from  such  an  analysis  that  managers  can  make  decisions  on

        whether to react to, ignore, or try to influence or anticipate future opportunities and threats discovered. The
        main purpose of environmental scanning is therefore to find out the correct “fit” between the firm and its

        environment, so that managers can formulate strategies to take advantage of the opportunities and avoid or
        reduce the impact of threats.


        Features of Environmental Analysis
               In  the  context  of  a  changing  environment,  the  process  of  environmental  analysis  is  very  well

        comparable to the functions of radar. From this analogy, it is possible to derive three important features of
        the process of environmental analysis (Ian Wilson).
               Holistic Exercise. Environmental analysis is a holistic exercise in the sense that it must comprise a

        total view of the environment rather than a piecemeal view of trends. It is a process of looking at the forest,
        rather than the trees.
                                                                                                              45]]></page><page Index="129"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                                                    Tanza Campus


               Continuous Activity. The analysis of environment must be a continuous process rather than a one

        – shot deal. Strategists must keep on tracking shifts in the overall pattern of trends and carry out detailed
        studies to keep a close watch on major trends.
               Exploratory Process. Environmental analysis is an exploratory process. A large part of the process

        seeks to explore the unknown terrain and the dimensions of possible future. The emphasis must be on
        speculating systematically about alternative outcomes, assessing probabilities, questioning assumptions and
        drawing rational conclusions.


        Techniques of Environmental Scanning

               So far, we have discussed the constituents of macro and operating environment and how these can
        become  a  threat  or  opportunity.  As  a  corporate  strategist,  one  has  to  identify  the  impact  of  these
        environmental forces on firm’s choice of direction and action.

               Environmental analysis involves two phases, information gathering and evaluation. Glueck and Jauch
        mention the following sources for environmental analysis:

                   1.  Verbal and written information: Verbal information is generally obtained by direct talk with
                       people,  by  attending  meetings,  seminars  etc,  or  through  media.  Written  or  documentary
                       information includes both published and unpublished material.

                   2.  Search and scanning: This involves research for obtaining the required information.
                   3.  Spying:  Although  it  may  not  be  considered  ethical,  spying  to  get  information  about
                       competitor’s business is not uncommon.

                   4.  Forecasting:  This  involves  estimating  the  future  trends  and  changes  in  the  environment.
                       There  are  many  techniques  of  forecasting.  It  can  be  done  by  the  corporate  planners  or
                       consultants.

               For  the  above  purpose,  firms  use  a  number  of  tools  and  techniques  depending  on  their  specific
        requirements in terms of quality, relevance, cost etc.

               Some of the techniques which are generally used for carrying out environmental analysis are:
                   1.  PESTEL analysis
                   2.  ETOP

                   3.  EFE Matrix
                   4.  CPM

        PESTEL Analysis

               PESTEL  Analysis  is  a  checklist  to  analyze  the  political,  economic,  socio-cultural,  technological,
        environmental and legal aspects of the environment.
               While doing PESTEL analysis, it is better to have three or four well-thought-out items that are justified

        with  evidence  than  a  lengthy  list.  Although  the  items  in  a  PESTEL  analysis  rely  on  past  events  and
        experience,  the  analysis  can  be  used  as  a  forecast  of  the  future.  The  past  is  history  and  strategic
        management is concerned with future action, but the best evidence about the future may derive from what

        happened in the past. It is worth attempting the task of deciphering this hidden assumption anyway. For
        example, when the Warner Brothers invested several hundred million dollars in the first Harry Porter film,

        they  made  an  assumption  that  the  fantasy  film  market  would  remain  attractive  throughout  the  world.  A
        structured PESTEL analysis might have given the same outcome even though it is difficult to predict.

        ETOP

               Environmental  Threats  and  Opportunities  Profile  (ETOP)  gives  a  summarized  picture  of
        environmental factors and their likely impact on the organization. ETOP is generally prepared as follows.

            1.  List environmental factors: The different aspects of the general as well as relevant environmental
               factors are listed. For example, economic environment can be divided into rate of economic growth,
               rate of inflation, fiscal policy etc.

            2.  Assess impact of each factor: At this stage, the impact of each factor is assessed closely and
               expressed in qualitative (high, medium or low) or quantitative factors (1, 2, 3). It is to be noted that

               not all identified environmental factors will have the same degree of impact. The impact is assessed
               as positive or negative.















        EFE Matrix

               Just like ETOP, the External Factor Evaluation Matrix (EFE Matrix) helps to summarize and evaluate
        the various components of external environment. The EFE Matrix can be developed in five steps:
            1.  List 10 to 20 important opportunities and threats.

            2.  Assign a weight to each factor from 0.0 (not important) to 1.0 (most important). The higher the weight,
               the more important is the factor to the current and future success of the company.
            3.  Assign  a  rating  to  each  factor  1(poor),  2  (average),  3  (above  average),  4  (superior).  The  rating

               indicates how effectively the firm’s current strategies respond to that particular factor.
            4.  Multiply each factor’s weight by its rating to determine a weighted score.

            5.  Finally, add the individual weighted scores for all the external factors to determine the total weighted

               score for the organization.

                                                                                               Sample EFE Matrix

               The  total  weighted  score  indicates  how  well  a  particular  company  is  responding  to  current  and
        expected factors in the environment. The highest possible total weighted score will be 4.0 and the lowest will

        be 1.0. The average score is 2.5. A score of 4.0 indicates that an organization is responding in an outstanding
        way to existing opportunities and threats. In the example above, the total weighted score of 2.6 means the
        company is above average in responding to factors in the environment.


        Competitive Profile Matrix (CPM)
               This is a competitor analysis, which focuses on each company against whom a firm competes directly.

        It helps to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the major competitors of the firm, vis-à-vis the firm.
        Generally, the Critical Success Factors (CSFs) are compared. In addition, other factors that can be compared
        are breadth of product line, sales, distribution, production capacity and efficiency, technological advantages

        etc. Using the format shown in Table, a firm can prepare competitor profile matrix.

        Forecasting Techniques
               Macro environmental and industry scanning and analysis are only marginally useful if what they do is

        to  reveal  current conditions. To  be  truly  useful,  such  analysis  must forecast future trends  and changes.
        Forecasting is a way of estimating the future events that are likely to have a major impact on the enterprise.
        It  is  a  technique  whereby  managers  try  to  predict  the  future  characteristics  of  the  environment  to  help

        managers  take  strategic  decisions.  Various  techniques  are  used  to  forecast  future  situations.  Important
        among these are:
               1.  Time  series  analysis:  Extrapolation  is  the most  widely  practiced form of forecasting.  Simply

                   stated, extrapolation is the extension of present trends into the future. It rests on the assumption
                   that the world is reasonably consistent and changes slowly in the short run. They attempt to carry
                   a series of historical events forward into the future. Because time series analysis projects historical

                   trends  into  the  future,  its  validity  depends  on  the  similarity  between  past  trends  and  future
                   conditions.

               2.  Judgmental  forecasting:  This  is  a  forecasting  technique  in  which  employees,  customers,
                   suppliers  etc.,  serve  as  a  source  of  information  regarding  future  trends.  For  example,  sales
                   representatives may be asked to forecast sales growth in various product categories based on

                   their interaction with customers. Survey instruments may be mailed to customers, suppliers or
                   trade associations to obtain their judgments on specific trends.

               3.  Expert opinion: This is a non-quantitative technique in which experts in a particular area attempt
                   to  forecast  likely  developments.  Knowledgeable  people  are  selected  and  asked  to  assign
                   importance and probability rating to various future developments. This type of forecast is based

                   on  the  ability  of  a  knowledgeable  person  to  construct  probable  future  developments  on  the
                   interaction of key variables.
                                                                                                              50]]></page><page Index="134"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY

               4.  Delphi  Technique:  This  is  a  forecasting  technique  in  which  the  opinion  of  experts  in  the

                   appropriate field are obtained about the probability of the occurrence of specified events. The
                   responses of the experts are compiled and a summary is sent to each expert. This process is
                   repeated until consensus is arrived at regarding the forecast of a particular event.

               5.  Statistical modeling: It is a quantitative technique that attempts to discover causal factors that
                   link two or more time series together. They use different sets of equations. Regression analysis
                   and other econometric methods are examples. Although very useful for grasping historical trends,

                   statistical  modeling  is  based  on  historical  data.  As  the  patterns  of  relationships  change,  the
                   accuracy of the forecast deteriorates.

               6.  Cross-impact Analysis: By this analysis, researchers analyze and identify key trends that will
                   impact all other trends. The question is then put: “If event A occurs, what will be the impact on all
                   other trends”. The results are used to build “domino chains”, with one event triggering others.

               7.  Brainstorming: It is a technique to generate a number of alternatives by a group of 6 to 10
                   persons. The basic ground rule is to propose ideas without first mentally evaluating them. No

                   criticism is allowed. Ideas tend to build on previous ideas until a consensus is reached. This is a
                   good technique to create ideas.
               8.  Demand/Hazard forecasting: Researchers identify major events that would greatly affect the

                   firm. Each event is rated for its convergence with several major trends taking place in society and
                   its appeal to a group of the public; the higher the event’s convergence and appeal, the higher its
                   probability of occurring.

            5-6      CASE STUDY: The Pharmaceutical Industry


               Historically,  the  pharmaceutical  industry  has  been  a  profitable  one.  Between  2002  and  2006  the

        average rate of return on invested capital (ROIC) for firms in the industry was 16.45%. Put differently, for
        every dollar of capital invested in the industry, the average pharmaceutical firm generated 16.45 cents of
        profit. This compares with an average return on invested capital of 12.76% for firms in the computer hardware

        industry, 8.54% for grocers, and 3.88% for firms in the electronics industry. However, the average level of
        profitability  in the  pharmaceutical  industry  has  been  declining  of  late.  In  2002, the  average  ROIC  in the

        industry was 21.6%; by 2006, it had fallen to 14.5%.
               The profitability of the pharmaceutical industry can be best understood by looking at several aspects
        of its underlying economic structure. First, demand for pharmaceuticals has been strong and has grown for

        decades. Between 1990 and 2003, there was a 12.5% annual increase in spending on prescription drugs in
        the United States. This growth was driven by favorable demographics. As people grow older, they tend to

        need and consume more prescription medicines, and the population in most advanced nations has been
        growing older as the post–World War II baby boom generation ages. Looking forward, projections suggest
        that spending on prescription drugs will increase at between 10 and 11% annually through till 2013.

               Second, successful new prescription drugs can be extraordinarily profitable. Lipitor, the cholesterol-
        lowering drug sold by Pfizer, was introduced in 1997, and by 2006, this drug had generated a staggering
        $12.5 billion in annual sales for Pfizer. The costs of manufacturing, packing, and distributing Lipitor amounted

        to only about 10% of revenues. Pfizer spent close to $500 million on promoting Lipitor and perhaps as much
        again on maintaining a sales force to sell the product. That still left Pfizer with a gross profit of perhaps $10
        billion. Since the drug is protected from direct  competition by a 20- year patent, Pfizer has a temporary



                                                                                                              52]]></page><page Index="136"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY

        monopoly and can charge a high price. Once the patent expires, which is scheduled to occur in 2010, other

        firms will be able to produce “generic” versions of Lipitor and the price will fall—typically by 80% within a year.
               Competing firms can produce drugs that are similar (but not identical) to a patent- protected drug.
        Drug firms patent a specific molecule, and competing firms can patent similar, but not identical, molecules

        that have a similar pharmacological effect. Thus Lipitor does have competitors in the market for cholesterol
        lowering drugs, such as Zocor sold by Merck and Crestor sold by AstraZeneca. But these competing drugs
        are also patent protected. Moreover, the high costs and risks associated with developing a new drug and

        bringing it to market limit new competition. Out of every 5,000 compounds tested in the laboratory by a drug
        company, only five enter clinical trials, and only one of these will ultimately make it to the market. On average,

        estimates suggest that it costs some $800 million and takes anywhere from 10 to 15 years to bring a new
        drug to market. Once on the market, only three out of 10 drugs ever recoup their R&D and marketing costs
        and turn a profit. Thus the high profitability of the pharmaceutical industry rests on a handful of blockbuster

        drugs. At Pfizer, the world’s largest pharmaceutical company, 55% of revenues were generated from just
        eight drugs.

                  To produce a blockbuster, a drug company must spend large amounts of money on research, most
        of which fails to produce a product. Only very large companies can shoulder the costs and risks of doing this,
        making it difficult for new companies to enter the industry. Pfizer, for example, spent some $7.44 billion on

        R&D in 2005 alone, equivalent to 14.5% of its total revenues. In a testament to just how difficult it is to get
        into the industry, although a large number of companies have been started in the last 20 years in the hope
        that they might develop new pharmaceuticals, only two of these companies, Amgen and Genentech, were

        ranked among the top 20 in the industry in terms of sales in 2005. Most have failed to bring a product to
        market.
                  In  addition  to  R&D  spending,  the  incumbent  firms  in  the  pharmaceutical  industry  spend  large

        amounts of money on advertising and sales promotion. While the $500 million a year that Pfizer spends
        promoting Lipitor is small relative to the drug’s revenues, it is a large amount for a new competitor to match,

        making market entry difficult unless the competitor has a significantly better product.
                  There  are  also  some  big  opportunities  on  the  horizon  for  firms  in  the  industry.  New  scientific
        breakthroughs in genomics are holding out the promise that within the next decade pharmaceutical firms

        might  be  able  to  bring  new  drugs  to  market  that  treat  some  of  the  most  intractable  medical  conditions,
        including Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s disease, cancer, heart disease, stroke, and AIDS. However, there are

        some threats to the long- term dominance and profitability of industry giants like Pfizer. First, as spending on
        health care rises, politicians are looking for ways to limit health care costs, and one possibility is some form
        of price control on prescription drugs. Price controls are already in effect in most developed nations, and

        although they have not yet been introduced in the United States, they could be.

                                                                                                              53]]></page><page Index="137"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY

                  Second, between 2006 and 2009, 12 of the top 35 selling drugs in the industry will lose their patent

        protection. By one estimate some 28% of the global drug industry’s sales of $307 billion will be exposed to
        generic challenge in America alone, due to drugs going of patent between 2006 and 2012. It is not clear to
        many industry observers whether the established drug companies have enough new drug prospects in their

        pipelines to replace revenues from drugs going off patent. Moreover, generic drug companies have been
        aggressive in challenging the patents of proprietary drug companies, and in pricing their generic offerings.
        As a result, their share of industry sales has been growing. In 2005, they accounted for more than half of all

        drugs prescribed by volume in the United States, up from one third in 1990.
                  Third, the industry has come under renewed scrutiny following studies which showed that some

        FDA approved prescription drugs, known as COX- 2 inhibitors, were associated with a greater risk of heart
        attacks. Two of these drugs, Vioxx and Bextra, were pulled from the market in 2004.

                                                      LESSON 4

                                              INTERNAL ASSESSMENT




                 Instructional Objectives


                Lesson 4 covers the WEEK 7 and 8 of the course syllabus. After the completion of the lesson,
                students will be able to:


                   1.  state the importance of internal analysis;

                   2.  discuss SWOT analysis;
                   3.  identify organizational capability factors; and

                   4.  describe the concept of benchmarking.




           I. IMPORTANCE OF INTERNAL ANALYSIS

                Internal analysis is also referred to as “internal appraisal”, “organizational audit”, “internal corporate
         assessment” etc. Over the years, research has shown that the overall strengths and weaknesses of a firm’s

         resources and capabilities are more important for a strategy than environmental factors. Even where the
         industry was unattractive and generally unprofitable, firms that came out with superior products enjoyed

         good profits.
                Managers perform internal analysis to identify the strengths and weaknesses of a firm’s resources
         and capabilities. The basic purpose is to build on the strengths and overcome the weaknesses in order to

         avail  of  the  opportunities  and  minimize  the  effects  of  threats.  The  ultimate  aim  is  to  gain  and  sustain
         competitive advantage in the marketplace.

                Strategic management is ultimately a “matching game” between environmental opportunities and
         organizational strengths. But, before a firm actually starts tapping the opportunities, it is important to know
         its own strengths and weaknesses. Without this knowledge, it cannot decide which opportunities to choose

         and which ones to reject. One of the ingredients critical to the success of a strategy is that the strategy must
         place  “realistic”  requirements  on  the  firm’s  resources.  The  firm  therefore  cannot  afford  to  go  by  some
         untested assumptions or gut feelings. Only systematic analysis of its strengths and weaknesses can be of



                                                                                                              55]]></page><page Index="139"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY

         help. This is accomplished in internal analysis by using analytical techniques like RBV, SWOT analysis,
         Benchmarking, IFE Matrix etc.

                Thus, systematic internal analysis helps the firm:
                   1.  To find where it stands in terms of its strengths and weaknesses
                   2.  To exploit the opportunities that are in line with its capabilities

                   3.  To correct important weaknesses
                   4.  To defend against threats
                   5.  To asses capability gaps and take steps to enhance its capabilities.


            II. SWOT ANALYSIS

                SWOT stands for strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats. SWOT analysis is a widely used
         framework  to  summaries  a  company’s  situation  or  current  position.  Any  company  undertaking  strategic

         planning will have to carry out SWOT analysis: establishing its current position in the light of its strengths,
         weaknesses, opportunities and threats. Environmental and industry analyses provide information needed to

         identify opportunities and threats, while internal analysis provides information needed to identify strengths
         and weaknesses. These are the fundamental areas of focus in SWOT analysis.
                SWOT analysis stands at the core of strategic management. It is important to note that strengths

         and  weaknesses  are  intrinsic  (potential)  value  creating  skills  or  assets  or  the  lack  thereof,  relative  to
         competitive forces. Opportunities and threats, however, are external factors that are not created by the
         company, but emerge as a result of the competitive dynamics caused by ‘gaps’ or ‘crunches’ in the market.

                Opportunities:  An  opportunity  is  a  major  favorable  situation  in  a  firm’s  environment.  Examples
         include  market  growth,  favorable  changes  in  competitive  or  regulatory  framework,  technological
         developments  or  demographic  changes,  increase  in  demand,  opportunity  to  introduce  products  in  new

         markets, turning R&D into cash by licensing or selling patents etc. The level of detail and perceived degree
         of realism determine the extent of opportunity analysis.


                Threats: A threat is a major unfavorable situation in a firm’s environment. Examples include increase
         in competition; slow market growth, increased power of buyers or suppliers, changes in regulations etc.
         These  forces  pose  serious  threats  to  a  company  because  they  may  cause  lower  sales,  higher  cost  of

         operations, higher cost of capital, inability to make break-even, shrinking margins or profitability etc. Your
         competitor’s opportunity may well be a threat to you.


                Strengths: Strength is something a company possesses or is good at doing. Examples include a
         skill,  valuable  assets,  alliances  or  cooperative  ventures,  experienced  sales  force,  easy  access  to  raw
         materials, brand reputation etc. Strengths are not a growing market, new products, etc.




                                                                                                              56]]></page><page Index="140"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                                                     Tanza Campus

                Weaknesses: A weakness is something a company lacks or does poorly. Examples include lack of
         skills or expertise, deficiencies in assets, inferior capabilities in functional areas etc. Though weaknesses

         are often seen as the logical ‘inverse’ of the company’s threats, the company’s lack of strength in a particular
         area or market is not necessarily a relative weakness because competitors may also lack this particular
         strength.



           III. Steps in SWOT Analysis



         The three important steps in SWOT analysis are:
            1.  Identification

            2.  Conclusion
            3.  Translation
                1. Identification:

                   a.  Identify company resource strengths and competitive capabilities
                   b.  Identify company resource weaknesses and competitive deficiencies
                   c.  Identify company’s opportunities

                   d.  Identify external threats
                2. Conclusion:
                   a.  Draw conclusions about the company’s overall situation

                3. Translation: Translate the conclusions into strategic actions by acting on them:
                   a.  Match the company’s strategy to its strengths and opportunities

                   b.  Correct important weaknesses
                   c.  Defend against external threats


                          Strengths                           Weaknesses
                                 Strong brand image                  Weak distribution network
                                 High quality products               Narrow product lines
                                 Latest technology                   Rising costs
                                 High intellectual capital           Poor marketing
                                 Cordial industrial relations
                          Opportunities                       Threats
                                 New markets                         Increase in competition
                                 Profitable new acquisitions         Barriers to entry
                                 R&D skills in new areas             Change in consumer tastes
                                 New businesses





         In devising a SWOT analysis, there are several factors that will enhance the quality of the material:

                                                                                                              57]]></page><page Index="141"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY

            2.  Relate strengths and weaknesses, wherever possible, to industry key factors for success.

            3.  Strengths and weaknesses should also be stated in competitive terms, that is, in comparison with
                competitors.
            4.  Statements should be specific and avoid blandness.

            5.  Analysis should reflect the gap, that is, where the company wishes to be and where it is now.
            6.  It is important to be realistic about the strengths and weaknesses of one’s own and competitive
                organizations.


                TOWS  matrix  is  just  an  extension  of  SWOT  matrix.  TOWS  stand  for  threats,  opportunities,
         weaknesses  and  strengths.  This  matrix  was  proposed  by  Heinz  Weihrich  as  a  strategy  formulation  –

         matching tool.
                TOWS  matrix  illustrates  how  internal  strengths  and  weaknesses  can  be  matched  with  external

         opportunities and threats to generate four sets of possible alternative strategies. This matrix can be used to
         generate corporate as well as business strategies. An example of TOWS matrix is shown below:



                          Internal factors/             Strengths(S)             Weaknesses(W)

                                                 that use strengths to take   strategies that take
                                                 advantage of              advantage of
                                                 opportunities.            opportunities by over -

                      Threats(T)                 ST strategies: strategies   WT strategies:
                                                 that use strengths to     strategies that minimize
                                                 avoid threats.            weaknesses and avoid
                                                                           threats.

                To generate a TOWS matrix, the following steps are to be followed:

                   1.  List external opportunities available in the company’s current and future environment, in the

                       ‘opportunities block’ on the left side of the matrix.
                   2.  List external threats facing the company now and in future in the “threats block” on the left

                       side of the matrix.
                   3.  List the specific areas of current and future strengths for the company, in the “strengths block”
                       across the top of the matrix.

                   4.  List the specific areas of current and future weaknesses for the company in the “weaknesses
                       box” across the top of the matrix.

                   5.  Generate  a  series  of  possible  alternative  strategies  for  the  company  based  on  particular
                       combinations of the four sets of factors

          IV. BENCHMARKING



               Benchmarking  is  the  process  of  comparing  the  business  processes  and  performance  metrics
        including  cost,  cycle  time,  productivity,  or  quality  to  another  that  is  widely  considered  to  be  an  industry

        standard benchmark or best practice. Essentially, benchmarking provides a snapshot of the performance of
        a business and helps one understand where one is in relation to a particular standard. The result is often a
        business case and "Burning Platform" for making changes in order to make improvements.

               Also referred to as "best practice benchmarking" or "process benchmarking", it is a process used in
        management and particularly strategic management, in which organizations evaluate various aspects of their

        processes in relation to best practice companies' processes, usually within a peer group defined for the
        purposes of comparison. This then allows organizations to develop plans on how to make improvements or
        adapt specific best practices, usually with the aim of increasing some aspect of performance. Benchmarking

        may be a one-off event, but is often treated as a continuous process in which organizations continually seek
        to improve their practices.

        Types of Benchmarking
        Benchmarking can be of following types:
        1.     Process  benchmarking:  the  initiating  firm  focuses  its  observation  and  investigation  of  business

               processes with a goal of identifying and observing the best practices from one or more benchmark
               firms.  Activity  analysis  will  be  required  where  the  objective  is  to  benchmark  cost  and  efficiency;
               increasingly applied to back-office processes where outsourcing may be a consideration.

        2.     Financial benchmarking: performing a financial analysis and comparing the results in an effort to
               assess your overall competitiveness and productivity.
        3.     Benchmarking  from  an  investor  perspective:  extending  the  benchmarking  universe  to  also

               compare to peer companies that can be considered alternative investment opportunities from the
               perspective of an investor.

        4.     Performance  benchmarking:  allows  the  initiator  firm  to  assess  their  competitive  position  by
               comparing products and services with those of target firms.
        5.     Product benchmarking: the process of designing new products or upgrades to current ones. This

               process can sometimes involve reverse engineering which is taking apart competitors’ products to
               find strengths and weaknesses.

        6.     Strategic benchmarking: involves observing how others compete. This type is usually not industry
               specific, meaning it is best to look at other industries.
        7.     Functional benchmarking: a company will focus its benchmarking on a single function in order to

               improve  the  operation  of  that  particular  function.  Complex  functions  such  as  Human  Resources,
               Finance and Accounting and Information and Communication Technology are unlikely to be directly
                                                                                                              60]]></page><page Index="144"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                                                    Tanza Campus


               comparable in cost and efficiency terms and may need to be disaggregated into processes to make

               valid comparison.
        8.     Best-in-class benchmarking: involves studying the leading competitor or the company that best
               carries out a specific function.

        9.     Operational benchmarking: embraces everything from staffing and productivity to office flow and
               analysis of procedures performed.


               The following is an example of a typical benchmarking methodology:
                   1.  Identify  your  problem  areas:  Because  benchmarking  can  be  applied  to  any  business

                       process or function, a range of research techniques may be required. They include: informal
                       conversations with customers, employees, or suppliers; exploratory research techniques such
                       as  focus  groups;  or  in-depth  marketing  research,  quantitative  research,  surveys,

                       questionnaires, re-engineering analysis, process mapping, quality control variance reports, or
                       financial  ratio  analysis.  Before  embarking  on  comparison  with  other  organizations  it  is

                       essential  that  one  knows  one's  own  organization's  function,  processes;  base  lining
                       performance provides a point against which improvement effort can be measured.
                   2.  Identify other industries that have similar processes: For instance if one were interested

                       in improving hand offs in addiction treatment he/she would try to identify other fields that also
                       have hand off challenges. These could include air traffic control, cell phone switching between
                       towers, transfer of patients from surgery to recovery rooms.

                   3.  Identify organizations that are leaders in these areas: Look for the very best in any industry
                       and in any country. Consult customers, suppliers, financial analysts, trade associations, and
                       magazines to determine which companies are worthy of study.

                   4.  Survey  companies  for  measures  and  practices:  Companies  target  specific  business
                       processes using detailed surveys of measures and practices used to identify business process

                       alternatives and leading companies. Surveys are typically masked to protect confidential data
                       by neutral associations and consultants.
                   5.  Visit  the  "best  practice"  companies  to  identify  leading  edge  practices:  Companies

                       typically agree to mutually exchange information beneficial to all parties in a benchmarking
                       group and share the results within the group.

                   6.  Implement new and improved business practices: Take the leading edge practices and
                       develop implementation plans which include identification of specific opportunities, funding the
                       project and selling the ideas to the organization for the purpose of gaining demonstrated value

                       from the process.

                                                                                                              61]]></page><page Index="145"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY

            7-8      CASE STUDY 4: NOKIA


        Early success

               With a young, united and energetic leadership team at the helm, Nokia’s early success was primarily
        the result of visionary and courageous management choices that leveraged the firm’s innovative technologies
        as digitalization and deregulation of telecom networks quickly spread across Europe. But in the mid-1990s,

        the near collapse of its supply chain meant Nokia was on the precipice of being a victim of its success. In
        response, disciplined systems and processes were put in place, which enabled Nokia to become extremely

        efficient and further scale up production and sales much faster than its competitors.
               Between 1996 and 2000, the headcount at Nokia Mobile Phones (NMP) increased 150 percent to
        27,353, while revenues over the period were up 503 percent. This rapid growth came at a cost. And that cost

        was that managers at Nokia’s main development centres found themselves under ever increasing short-term
        performance pressure and were unable to dedicate time and resources to innovation.

               While the core business focused on incremental improvements, Nokia’s relatively small data group
        took up the innovation mantle. In 1996, it launched the world’s first smartphone, the Communicator, and was
        also responsible for Nokia’s first camera phone in 2001 and its second-generation smartphone, the innovative

        7650.
        The search for an elusive third leg
               Nokia’s leaders were aware of the importance of finding what they called a “third leg” – a new growth

        area to complement the hugely successful mobile phone and network businesses. Their efforts began in
        1995  with  the  New  Venture  Board  but  this  failed  to  gain  traction  as  the  core  businesses  ran  their  own
        venturing activities and executives were too absorbed with managing growth in existing areas to focus on

        finding new growth.
                                                                                                              62]]></page><page Index="146"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                                                    Tanza Campus




               A renewed effort to find the third leg was launched with the Nokia Ventures Organization (NVO) under
        the leadership of one of Nokia’s top management team. This visionary programme absorbed all existing
        ventures and sought out new technologies. It was successful in the sense that it nurtured a number of critical

        projects which were transferred to the core businesses. In fact, many opportunities NVO identified were too
        far ahead of their time; for instance, NVO correctly identified “the internet of things” and found opportunities
        in  multimedia  health  management  –  a  current  growth  area.  But  it  ultimately  failed  due  to  an  inherent

        contradiction between the long-term nature of its activities and the short-term performance requirements
        imposed on it.

        The swift decline
               The following years marked a period of infighting and strategic stasis that successive reorganizations
        did nothing to alleviate. By this stage, Nokia was trapped by a reliance on its unwieldy operating system

        called Symbian. While Symbian had given Nokia an early advantage, it was a device-centric system in what
        was  becoming  a  platform-  and  application-centric  world.  To  make  matters  worse,  Symbian  exacerbated

        delays in new phone launches as whole new sets of code had to be developed and tested for each phone
        model. By 2009, Nokia was using 57 different and incompatible versions of its operating system.
               While Nokia posted some of its best financial results in the late 2000s, the management team was

        struggling to find a response to a changing environment: Software was taking precedence over hardware as
        the critical competitive feature in the industry. At the same time, the importance of application ecosystems
        was becoming apparent, but as dominant industry leader Nokia lacked the skills, and inclination to engage

        with this new way of working.
               By 2010, the limitations of Symbian had become painfully obvious and it was clear Nokia had missed
        the shift toward apps pioneered by Apple. Not only did Nokia’s strategic options seem limited, but none were

        particularly attractive. In the mobile phone market, Nokia had become a sitting duck to growing competitive
        forces and accelerating market changes. The game was lost, and it was left to a new CEO Stephen Elop and

        new Chairman Risto Siilasmaa to draw from the lessons and successfully disengage Nokia from mobile
        phones to refocus the company on its other core business, network infrastructure equipment.

                   5.  identify the business tactics.












          I. INTRODUCTION


               Corporate strategy is primarily about the choice of direction for the corporation as a whole. The
        basic purpose of a corporate strategy is to add value to the individual businesses in it. A corporate strategy
        involves decisions relating to the choice of businesses, allocation of resources among different businesses,

        transferring  skills  and  capabilities  from  one  set  of  businesses  to  others,  and  managing  and  nurturing  a
        portfolio of businesses in such a way as to obtain synergies among product lines and business units, so that
        the corporate whole is greater than the sum of its individual business units. The essence of a corporate

        strategy vis-a-vis a business-level strategy is summarized in Figure 1.





                                                                                                              64]]></page><page Index="148"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                                                    Tanza Campus































               Corporate strategy is thus concerned with two basic issues:
                   1.  What businesses should a firm compete in?

                   2.  How can these businesses be coordinated and managed so that they create “Synergy.”

           II. EXPANSION STRATEGIES


               Growth strategies are the most widely pursued corporate strategies. Companies that do business in

        expanding industries must grow to survive. A company can grow internally by expanding its operations or it
        can grow externally through mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures or strategic alliances.
        Reasons for Pursuing Growth Strategies

        Firms generally pursue growth strategies for the following reasons:
            1.  To obtain economies of scale: Growth helps firms to achieve large-scale operations, whereby fixed

               costs can be spread over a large volume of production.
            2.  To attract merit: Talented people prefer to work in firms with growth.
            3.  To increase profits: In the long run, growth is necessary for increasing profits of the organization,

               especially in the turbulent and hyper–competitive environment.
            4.  To  become  a  market  leader:  Growth  allows  firms  to  reach  leadership  positions  in  the  market.
               Companies such as Reliance Industries, TISCO etc. reached commanding heights due to growth

               strategies.
            5.  To fulfill natural urge: A healthy firm normally has a natural urge for growth. Growth opportunities
               provide great stimulus to such urge. Further, in a dynamic world characterized by the growth of many

               firms around it, a firm would have a natural urge for growth.
                                                                                                              65]]></page><page Index="149"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                                                    Tanza Campus


            6.  To ensure survival: Sometimes, growth is essential for survival. In some cases, a firm may not be

               able to survive unless it has critical minimum level of business. Further, if a firm does not grow when
               competitors are growing, it may undermine its competitiveness.



        Categories of Growth Strategies
        Growth strategies can be divided into three broad categories:

            1.  Intensive Strategies
            2.  Integration Strategies

            3.  Diversification Strategies
        Intensive Strategies
               Without moving outside the organization’s current range of products or services, it may be possible

        to attract customers by intensive advertising, and by realigning the product and market options available to
        the organization. These strategies are generally referred to as intensification or concentration strategies. By

        intensifying its efforts, the firm will be able to increase its sales and market share of the current product-line
        faster. This is probably the most successful internal growth strategy for firms whose products or services are
        in the final stages of the product life cycle. Most of the approaches of intensive strategies deal with product-

        market realignments.
               Thus, there are three important intensive strategies:
               1.  Market penetration

               2.  Market development
               3.  Product development


               1.  Market penetration seeks to increase market share for existing products in the existing markets
                   through  greater  marketing  efforts.  This  includes  activities  like  increasing  the  sales  force,

                   increasing  promotional  effort,  giving  incentives  etc.  Market  penetration  is  generally  achieved
                   through the following three major approaches:
                       a)  Increasing sales to the current customers

                       b)  Attracting competitor’s customers
                       c)  Attracting non-users to buy the product


               2.  Market development seeks to increase market share by selling the present products in new
                   markets. This can be achieved through the following approaches:

                       a)  By entering new geographic markets (regional, national, international)


                                                                                                              66]]></page><page Index="150"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                                                    Tanza Campus


                       b)  By entering new market segments (Developing product versions to appeal to other
                          segments)

               3.  Product development seeks to increase the market share by developing new or improved
                   products for present markets.
                       a)  Developing new product features
                       b)  Developing quality variations
                       c)  Developing additional models and sizes (product proliferation)



        Integrative Strategies

               Integration basically means combining activities relating to the present activity of a firm. Such
        a combination can be done on the basis of the industry value chain. A company performs a number of

        activities to transform an input to output. These activities include right from the procurement of raw
        materials  to  the  production  of  finished  goods  and  their  marketing  and  distribution to the ultimate
        consumers.  These  activities  are  also  called  value  chain  activities;  the value  chain  activities  of  an

        industry are shown in Figure 2. So, a firm that adopts integration may move forward or backward the
        industry value chain.


                                                Figure  2:  Industry  Value  Chain








        Thus, integration is basically of two types:
            1.  Vertical integration and
            2.  Horizontal integration

        Vertical Integration
               Vertical  integration  involves  gaining  ownership  or  increased  control  over  suppliers  or

        distributors. It has two types:
            1.  Backward Integration involves gaining ownership or increased control of a firm’s suppliers.

               For example, a manufacturer of finished products may take over the business of a supplier

               who  manufactures  raw  materials,  component  parts  and  other  inputs.  Brooke  Bond’s
               acquisition of tea plantations is an example of backward integration.

               This strategy is generally adopted when:


                                                                                                              67]]></page><page Index="151"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                                                    Tanza Campus


                   a.  Present suppliers are unreliable, too costly or cannot meet the firm’s needs.

                   b.  The firm’s industry is growing rapidly.

                   c.  The number of suppliers is small, but the number of competitors is large.
                   d.  Stable prices are important to stabilize cost of raw materials.

                   e.  The firm has both capital and human resources to manage the new business.


            2.  Forward integration involves gaining ownership or increased control over distributors or
               retailers.



               Forward Integration is generally adopted when:
                   a)  The present distributors are expensive, or unreliable or incapable of meeting the firm’s

                       needs.
                   b)  The availability of quality distributors is limited.

                   c)  The firm’s industry is growing and will continue to grow.
                   d)  The advantages of stable production are high.

                   e)  The  firm  has  both  the  capital  and  human  resources  needed  to  manage  the  new

                       business.
        Horizontal Integration

               Horizontal integration is a strategy of seeking ownership or increased control over a firm’s

        competitors. Some authors prefer to call this as horizontal diversification. By whichever name it is
        called, this strategy generally involves the acquisition, merger or takeover of one or more similar

        firms operating at the same stage of the industry value chain.
               The  most  important  advantage  of  horizontal  integration  is  that  it  generally  eliminates  or

        reduces competition. Other advantages are:
                   a.  It yields access to new markets.

                   b.  It provides economies of scale.

                   c.  It allows transfer of resources and capabilities.
               Horizontal integration is an appropriate strategy when:

                   a.  A firm competes in a growing industry.
                   b.  Increased economies of scale provide a major competitive advantage.

                   c.  A  firm  has  both  the  capital  and  human  talent  needed  to  successfully  manage  an
                       expanded organization.

                                                                                                              68]]></page><page Index="152"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                                                    Tanza Campus


                   d.  Competitors are faltering due to lack of managerial expertise or resources, which the

                       firm has.

        Diversification Strategies
               Diversification is the process of adding new businesses to the existing businesses of the

        company.  In  other  words,  diversification  adds  new  products  or  markets  to  the  existing  ones.  A
        diversified company is one that has two or more distinct businesses. The diversification strategy is

        concerned with achieving a greater market from a greater range of products in order to maximize
        profits.



               The important reasons for a company diversifying their business are:
                   1.  Saturation  or  decline  of  the  current  business:  If  the  company  is  faced  with

                       diminishing market opportunities and stagnating sales in its principal business, it may
                       become necessary to enter new businesses to achieve growth.

                   2.  Better  opportunities:  Even  when  the  current  business  provides  scope  for further
                       growth, there may be better opportunities in new lines of business. A firm in a “sunset

                       industry” may be tempted to enter a “sunrise industry.”

                   3.  Sharing of resources and strengths: Diversification enables companies to leverage
                       existing  competencies  and  capabilities  by  expanding  into  businesses  where  these

                       resources  become  valuable  competitive  assets.  By  sharing  production  facilities,

                       technological  capabilities,  managerial  expertise,  distribution  channels,  sales  force,
                       financial resources etc., synergy can be obtained.

                   4.  New avenues for reducing costs: Diversifying into closely related businesses opens
                       new avenues for reducing costs.

                   5.  Technologies and products: By expanding into industries, the company can obtain
                       new technologies and products, which can complement its present businesses.

                   6.  Use of brand name: Through diversification, the company can transfer its powerful

                       and well-known brand name to the products of other businesses.
                   7.  Risk minimization: The big risk of a single-business firm is having all its eggs in one

                       industry basket.

                                                    Tanza Campus


               Types of Diversification

                   1.  Concentric Diversification: Adding a new, but related business is called concentric

                       diversification. It involves acquisition of businesses that are related to the acquiring
                       firm  in  terms  of  technology,  markets  or  products.  The  selected  new  business  has

                       compatibility with the firm’s current business.
                   2.  Conglomerate  diversification:  Adding  a  new,  but  unrelated  business  is  called
                       conglomerate  diversification.  The  new  business  will  have  no  relationship  to  the
                       company’s technology, products or markets.


          III. RETRENCHMENT STRATEGIES



               They are the last resort strategies. A company may pursue retrenchment strategies when it has a
        weak competitive position in some or all of its product lines resulting in poor performance – sales are down
        and profits are dwindling. In an attempt to eliminate the weaknesses that are dragging the company down,

        management may follow one or more of the following retrenchment strategies.
        Turnaround Strategy
               A firm is said to be sick when it faces a severe cash crunch or a consistent downtrend in its operating

        profits. Such firms become insolvent unless appropriate internal and external actions are taken to change the
        financial picture of the firm. This process of recovery is called “turnaround strategy”.
        When Turnaround becomes Necessary

               Do  companies  turn  sick  overnight  and  qualify  as  potential  candidates  for  turnaround  or  do  they
        become sick slowly which can be stopped by timely corrective action? Obviously, the latter is true in most of

        the cases. But the reality is also that companies becoming sick often do not themselves recognize this fact,
        and fail to take timely action to remedy the situation.
               Despite the fact that factors that lead to sickness may vary from company to company, there are some

        common signals which herald the onset of sickness. John M Harris has listed a dozen danger signals of
        impending sickness.

               1.  Decreasing market share
               2.  Decreasing profitability
               3.  Increasing dependence on debt

               4.  Failure to reinvest sufficiently in the business
               5.  Diversification at the expense of the core business
               6.  Lack of planning

               7.  Inflexible chief executives

                                                                                                              70]]></page><page Index="154"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                                                    Tanza Campus


               8.  A management team unwilling to learn from its competitors

        Types of Turnaround Strategies
               The operating turnaround strategies are of four types. These are:
                       1.  Revenue-increasing strategies

                       2.  Cost-cutting strategies
                       3.  Asset-reduction strategies
                       4.  Combination strategies

        Divestment
               Selling a division or part of an organization is called divestiture. This strategy is often used to raise

        capital for further strategic acquisitions or investments. Divestiture is generally used as a part of turnaround
        strategy to get rid of businesses that are unprofitable, that require too much capital or that do not fit well with
        the firm's other activities.

               Divestiture is an appropriate strategy to be pursued under the following circumstances:
                   1.  When a business cannot be turned around

                   2.  When a business needs more resources than the company can provide
                   3.  When a business is responsible for a firm's overall poor performance
                   4.  When a business is a misfit with the rest of the organization

                   5.  When a large amount of cash is required quickly
                   6.  When government's legal actions threaten the existence of a business.
        Types of Divestitures

            1.  Spin-off: It is a kind of demerger when an existing parent company distributes on a pro- rata basis
               the shares of the new company to the shareholders of the parent company free of cost. There is no
               money transaction, subsidiary's assets are not revalued, and transaction is treated as stock dividend.

               Both the companies exist and carry on their businesses independently after spin-off. During spin-off,
               a  new  company  comes  into  existence.  The  shareholders  of  the  parent  company  become  the

               shareholders of the new company spun- off.
            2.  Sell-off: It is a form of restructuring, where a firm sells a division to another company. When the
               business unit is sold, payment is received generally in the form of cash or securities.

            3.  Voluntary corporate liquidation or bust-ups: It is also known as complete sell-off. The companies
               normally go for voluntary liquidation because they create value to the shareholders. The firm may

               have a higher value in liquidation than the current market value. Here the firm sells its assets/divisions
               to multiple parties which may result in a higher value being realised than if they had to be sold as a
               whole. Through a series of spin- offs or sell-offs a company may go ultimately for liquidation.

                                                    Tanza Campus


            4.  Equity carveouts: It is a different type of divestiture and different form of spin-off and sell- off. It
               resembles Initial Public Offering (IPO) of some portion of equity stock of a wholly owned subsidiary
               by the parent company.

        Bankruptcy
               This is a form of defensive strategy. It allows organizations to file a petition in the court for legal

        protection to the firm, in case the firm is not in a position to pay its debts. The court decides the claims on the
        company and settles the corporation's obligations.
        Liquidation

               Liquidation occurs when an entire company is dissolved and its assets are sold. It is a strategy of the
        last resort. When there are no buyers for a business which wants to be sold, the company may be wound up

        and its assets may be sold to satisfy debt obligations.


          IV. BUSINESS LEVEL STRATEGIES




                      Each  business  should  have  its  own  business  strategy.  A  business  strategy  is  basically  a
        competitive  strategy  and  is  concerned  more  with  how  a  business  competes  successfully  in  the  chosen
        market. The strategic decisions at business-level revolve around choice of products and markets, meeting

        the needs of customers, protecting market share, gaining advantage over competitors, exploiting or creating
        new opportunities and earning profit at the business unit level. In short, a business strategy outlines the
        competitive posture of its operations in the industry.

        Industry Structure
                      An industry is a collection of firms offering goods or services that are close substitutes of each
        other. Alternatively, an industry consists of firms that directly compete with each other. For the purpose of

        industry analysis, an industry can be defined rather broadly (the beverage industry) or more precisely (the
        carbonated soft drink industry). How one defines and circumscribes an industry depends on the kinds of

        analysis to be performed. In “industry analysis”, it is generally better to define an industry as precisely as
        possible.
        Industry structure consists of four elements:

                   a.  Concentration: It means the extent to which industry sales are dominated by only a few firms.
                       In a highly concentrated industry, i.e. an industry whose sales are dominated by a handful of
                       firms, the intensity of competition declines over time. High concentration serves as a barrier

                       to entry into an industry, because it enables the firms to hold large market shares to achieve
                       significant economies of scale.



                                                                                                              72]]></page><page Index="156"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                                                    Tanza Campus


                   b.  Economies of Scale: This is an important determinant of competition in an industry. Firms

                       that enjoy economies of scale can charge lower prices than their competitors, because of their
                       savings in per unit cost of production. They also can create barriers to entry by reducing their
                       prices temporarily or permanently to deter new firms from entering the industry.

                   c.  Product differentiation: Real perceived differentiation often intensifies competition among
                       existing firms.
                   d.  Barriers to entry: Barriers to entry are the obstacles that a firm must overcome to enter an

                       industry, and the competition from new entrants depends mostly on entry barriers.


        Generic Strategies
               Generic strategies were first outlined in two books from Michael Porter of Harvard Business School.
        These  were  “Competitive  Strategy”  in  1980  and  “Competitive  Advantage’’  in  1985.  The  second  book

        contained a small modification of the concept.
               Professor Porter argued that the three basic strategies open to any business are:

            1.  Cost leadership is a strategy whereby a firm aims to deliver its product or service at a price lower
               than that of its competitors. Overall cost leadership is achieved by the firm by maintaining the lowest
               costs of production and distribution within an industry and offering “no-frills” products. This strategy

               requires economies of scale in production and close attention to efficiency and operating costs. The
               firm places  a  lot  of  emphasis  on  minimizing  direct  input  and  overhead  costs,  by  offering  no-frills

               products.
            2.  Differentiation consists of offering a product or service that is perceived as unique or distinctive by
               the  customer. This  allows  firms  to  command  a  premium  price  or to  retain  buyer  loyalty  because

               customers will pay more for what they regard as a better product. A differentiation strategy can be
               more profitable than a cost leadership strategy because of the premium price.
               Products  can  be  differentiated  in  a  number  of  ways  so  that  they  stand  apart  from  standardized

               products:  Superior  quality,  special  or  unique  features,  more  responsive  customer  service,  new
               technologies and dealer network.
            3.  Focus strategy occurs when a firm focuses on a specific niche in the market place and develops its

               competitive advantage by offering products especially developed for that niche. It targets a specific
               consumer group (e.g. teenagers, babies, old people etc.) or a specific geographic market (urban

               areas, rural areas etc.).

        Business Tactics

               Tactics should work with a firm’s strategy and they are the set of requirements need for the plan to
               take place. A tactic is a device used by the firm for meeting your goals set by your strategy. Strategy
               and tactics should always be relative to one another because the tactics are the set of actions needed

               to fulfill your strategy.
                   1.  Tactics are the tools used to achieve goals.
                   2.  Tactics include things like advertising and marketing.
                   3.  Tactics are the steps taken to achieve goals.

        Brand Management

               One tactic that almost every firm employs is strategic brand management. Firms must find a way to
        communicate their products and corporate philosophy to potential customers. Over time, a business can
        establish a reputation that gives its brand name an advantage over the lesser known competitors.

               Brand management includes good advertising and public relations to present an image of that is
        consistent with the mission and vision of the company. A company may also conduct research or poll the

        general public to learn about how it is perceived and what changes are necessary.

        Diversification and Specialisation

               Two  different  business  strategies  that  deal  with  the  scope  of  a  company  are  diversification  and
        specialisation. A business can diversify by simply expanding its products and services, such as adding a new
        division, or through merging or acquiring another business.

               Specialisation is the opposite of diversification. It refers to narrowing a business’s products to focus
        on a more specific type of product. By focusing limited resources on a smaller product line, a business may
        hope to improve the quality of its remaining products, or simply divest itself of an unprofitable product.


        Research and Development

               Some  firms  use  investments  into  research  and  development  as  a  major  tactic  to  get  ahead  of
        competitors. This is particularly true in the manufacturing field, where new product technologies can save
        money and produce products that will excite consumers. Smaller businesses may lack the money or in-house

        talent to invest directly in research and development, but for larger companies the ability to innovate can be
        the difference between success and failure.

          I. INTRODUCTION


               Strategic  analysis  and  choice  is  essentially  a  decision-making  process.  This  involves  generating
        feasible alternatives, evaluating those alternatives and choosing a specific course of action that could best

        enable the firm to achieve its mission and objectives.
               Alternative strategies do not come from a vacuum. They are derived from the firm’s present strategies
        keeping in view the vision, mission, objectives and also the information gathered from external and internal

        analysis. They are consistent with or built on past strategies that have worked well.
        Process for Strategic Choice
               According to Glueck and Jauch, “strategic choice is the decision to select from among the alternatives

        considered, the strategy which will best meet the enterprise objectives.”
               This decision-making process consists of four distinct steps:
                   1.  Focusing on a few alternatives.

                              Strategists never consider all feasible options that could benefit the firm because there
                       are  innumerable  options.  So  strategists  should  narrow  down  the  choice  to  a  reasonable

                       number of alternatives. But it is still difficult to tell what that reasonable number is. For deciding
                       on a reasonable number of alternatives, we can make use of the following concepts:

                                                                                                              76]]></page><page Index="160"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY

                          A.  Gap analysis

                              In gap analysis, a company sets objectives for a future period of time, say three
                              to five years of time, and then works backward to find out where it can reach at
                              the present level of efforts. By analyzing the difference between the projected
                              and desired performance, a performance gap could be found as shown in the
                              figure below.












                          B.  Business Definition
                                 In deciding on what would be a manageable number of alternatives, it is advisable
                          to start with the business definition. Business definition, as discussed earlier, determines

                          the scope of activities that can be undertaken by a firm. It tries to answer three basic
                          questions clearly: (i) who is being satisfied? (ii) what is being satisfied? and (iii) how the
                          need is being satisfied?


                   2.  Considering the selection factors.
                              The concepts of Gap Analysis and Business definition would help the strategist to

                       identify a few workable alternatives. These must be analyzed further against a set of selection
                       criteria.
                              Selection factors are the criteria against which the alternative strategies are evaluated.

                       These selection factors consist of:
                              a.  Objective factors are based on analytical techniques such as BCG matrix etc. and
                                 are hard facts or data used to facilitate a strategic choice. They are also called

                                 rational, normative or prescriptive factors.
                              b.  Subjective factors, on the other hand, are based on one’s personal judgment or
                                 descriptive factors such as consistency, feasibility, etc. which are discussed in the

                                 previous unit.
                   3.  Evaluating the alternatives

                              After narrowing down the alternative strategies to a few alternatives, each alternative
                       has to be evaluated for its suitability to achieve the organizational objectives. Evaluation of

                                                                                                              77]]></page><page Index="161"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                                                    Tanza Campus


                       strategic alternatives basically involves bringing together the results of the analysis carried out

                       on the basis of objective and subjective criteria.
                   4.  Making the actual choice
                              An evaluation of alternative strategies leads to a clear assessment of which alternative

                       is most suitable to achieve the organizational goals. The final step, therefore, is to make the
                       actual choice. One or more strategies have to be chosen for implementation. Besides the
                       chosen  strategies,  some  contingency  strategies  should  also  be  worked  out  to  meet  any

                       eventualities. In both the above two steps, a number of portfolio analyses like BCG, nine–cell
                       matrix etc., can be useful.


           II. STRATEGIC ANALYSIS

               Fred R David has developed a comprehensive strategy formulation and analytical framework which
        is very useful for strategic analysis and choice. We now discuss the framework briefly.

               This framework consists of three stages:
               1.  Input stage

                       This stage summarizes the basic input information needed to generate alternative strategies.
                   This basic input information relates to the opportunities and threats, strengths and weaknesses
                   as also the competitive profile of the firm. This information can be obtained from the following

                   three matrices:
                       a.  External Factor Evaluation Matrix (EFE Matrix)
                       b.  Internal Factor Evaluation Matrix (IFE Matrix)

                       c.  Competitive Profile Matrix (CPM Matrix)
                       Making  small  decisions  on  the  relative  importance  of  external  and  internal  factors  allows
                   strategists to generate and evaluate alternative strategies more effectively. Besides, good intuitive

                   judgment is always needed in determining appropriate weights and ratings.
               2.  Matching stage

                       This  stage  involves  the  match  between  the  internal  resources  and  skills  and  the  external
                   opportunities and threats of an organization. The following matrices can be used for the purpose:
                       a.  SWOT Matrix (Already discussed in unit 5)

                       b.  BCG matrix
               3.  Decision stage
                       The matching techniques discussed above reveal feasible alternative strategies, which need

                   to be examined and appropriate strategies selected for implementation.

          III. CORPORATE PORTFOLIO ANALYSIS


               Many companies offer more than one product, and serve more than one customer. They have a

        portfolio (i.e. a basket) of products. This is a good strategy because a firm which is dependent on one product
        or customer runs immense risk. Decisions on strategy, therefore, generally involve a range of products in a
        range of markets.

               Portfolio analysis is an analytical tool which views a corporation as a basket or portfolio of products
        or business units to be managed for the best possible returns, and help a corporate to build a multi-business

        strategy.
            The aim of portfolio analysis is:
            1.  To analyze its current business portfolio and decide  which business should receive more or less

               investment.
            2.  To develop growth strategies for adding new businesses to the portfolio.

            3.  To decide which business should no longer be retained.

        Display Matrices

               “Display matrices” are simple frameworks in which products or business units are displayed as a
        series of investments from which top management expects a profitable return. It charts and characterizes
        different  products  or  businesses  in  the  organization’s  portfolio  of  investments  in  such  a  way  that  top

        management constantly juggles to ensure the best returns from them.
               As already stated, key purpose of portfolio models is to assist in achieving a balanced portfolio of
        businesses. This means that portfolio should consist of those businesses whose profitability, growth, cash

        flow  and  risk  elements  would  complement  each  other,  and  add  up  to  a  satisfactory  overall  corporate
        performance. Imbalance in portfolio, for example, could be caused either by excessive cash generation with

        too few growth opportunities or by insufficient cash generation to fund the growth requirements of other
        businesses in the portfolio.


        Balancing the Portfolio
          Balancing the portfolio means that the different products or businesses in the portfolio have to be balanced

        with respect to four basic aspects:
         i.  Profitability:  The  main  aim  of  the  portfolio  analysis  is  to  maintain  the  overall  profitability  of  the
            corporation, even though some of the businesses are loss making. This is ensured through balancing

            investments.


                                                                                                              79]]></page><page Index="163"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                                                    Tanza Campus


        ii.  Cash flow: A growing firm may be profitable, but it will also require additional cash outflows for investment

            requirements. Mature businesses, though less profitable, do not require much of investments though they
            may  not  be  net  cash  generators.  Thus,  portfolio  analysis  must  balance  different  businesses,  which
            together must give a comfortable overall cash flow position in harmony with the desired strategy of the

            company.
        iii.  Growth: All businesses or products go through the life cycle of introduction, growth, maturity and decline
            stages. If a company depends on one product alone, it would face problems in the declining stage of the

            product. It may be too late to start a new product at this stage because of the time lag involved in waiting
            till it achieves its growth rate. It is therefore better to match different businesses at different stages in their

            life  cycles,  to  achieve  stability  which  is  sometimes  called  “extended  corporate  immortality”. Thus the
            balancing of the portfolio implies that though individual businesses grow, mature and decline, yet the
            company continues to grow.

        iv.  Risk: Another major objective of portfolio analysis is to reduce the risk due to economic trends and market
            forces in a country. The aim is to put together diverse businesses with different or even opposite market

            forces to ensure a stable and smoother financial performance of the overall corporation.

        Portfolio and other Analytical Models

               Innumerable analytical models have been developed by several leading consulting firms. Some of the
        best-known models are
        BCG Matrix

               The BCG matrix was developed by the Boston Consultancy group in 1970s. It is also called the
        “Growth share matrix”. This is the most popular and the simplest matrix to describe a corporation’s portfolio
        of businesses or products. BCG matrix is based on the premise that majority of the companies carry out

        multiple  business  activities  in  a  number  of  different  product-market  segments.  Together,  these  different
        businesses form the business portfolio of the company, which need to be balanced for overall profitability of

        the company.
               To ensure long-term success, a company’s business portfolio should consist of both high-growth
        products in need of cash inputs and low-growth products that generate excess cash.

               The BCG matrix helps to determine priorities in a product portfolio. Its basic purpose is to invest where
        there is growth from which the firm can benefit, and divest those businesses that have low market share and

        low growth prospects.

        Each of the products or business units is plotted on a two-dimensional matrix consisting of

            a.  Relative market share
                       Relative market share is defined as the ratio of the market share of the concerned product or
               business unit in the industry divided by the share of the market leader. By this calculation, a relative

               market share of 1.0 belongs to the market leader.

                                  For example, if market share of 3 businesses A, B, C are

                                                 Busines                               Market share
                                                    s
                                                    A                    -                 10%
                                                    B                    -                 20%
                                                    C                    -                 60%

                                  A’s  relative  market  share=10/60=1/6
                                  B’s  relative  market  share=20  /60=1/3
                                  C’s relative market share=60/20=3
                                  The relative market share reflects the firm’s capacity to generate cash. It is assumed that if a
                                  business unit enjoys high market share, its cash earnings would be correspondingly higher
                                  and vice versa.

            b.  Market growth rate.

                       It is the percentage of market growth, that is, the percentage by which sales of a particular
               product or business unit have increased.

                       A high growth rate enables the company to expand its operations. It makes it easier for the
               company to increase its market share and provide the opportunities of profitable investment. The
               company may plough back its earnings into the business and further increase the rate of return on

               the investment. Additional cash will necessarily be required to avail of the investment opportunities
               for  growth.  On  the  other  hand,  low  market  growth  rate  indicates  stagnation  with  little  scope  for

               expansion and profitable investments may be risky to undertake. Increase in market share in such a
               situation can be possible only by cutting into the competitor’s market price.

        Analysis of BCG Matrix


        Stars (High Growth, High Market Share)
               Stars are products that enjoy a relatively high market share in a strongly growing market. They are

               (potentially)  profitable  and  may  grow  further  to  become  an  important  product  or  category  for  the
               company. The firm  should  focus  on  and  invest  in  these  products  or business  units. The general
               features of stars are:

                   a.  High growth rate means they need heavy investment
                   b.  High market share means they have economies of scale and generate large amounts of cash

                   c.  But they need more cash than they generate.
               The high growth rate will mean that they will need heavy investment and will therefore be cash users.
        Overall, the general strategy is to take cash from the cash cows to fund stars. Cash may also be invested

        selectively in some problem children (question marks) to turn them into stars. The other problem children
        may be milked or even sold to provide funds elsewhere


        Cash Cows (Low Growth, High Market Share)
               These are the product areas that have high relative market shares but exist in low-growth markets.

        The business is mature and it is assumed that lower levels of investment will be required. On this basis, it is
        therefore likely that they will be able to generate both cash and profits. Such profits could then be transferred
        to support the stars. The general features of cash cows are:

            a.  They generate both cash and profits
            b.  The business is mature and needs lower levels of investment
            c.  Profits are transferred to support stars/question marks

            d.  The danger is that cash cows may become under-supported and begin to lose their market.
               Although the market is no longer growing, the cash cows may have a relatively high market share and

        bring in healthy profits. No efforts or investments are necessary to maintain the status quo. Cash cows may
        however ultimately become dogs if they lose the market share.


        Question Marks (High Growth, Low Market Share)
               Question marks are also called problem children or wild cats. These are products with low relative

        market shares in high-growth markets. The high market growth means that considerable investment may still
        be required and the low market share will mean that such products will have difficulty in generating substantial
        cash.  These  businesses  are  called’  question  marks  because  the  organization  must  decide  whether  to

        strengthen them or to sell them.

                                                                                                              82]]></page><page Index="166"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                                                    Tanza Campus


        The general features of question marks are:

            a.  Their cash needs are high
            b.  But their cash generation is low
            c.  Organization must decide whether to strengthen them or sell them.


        Dogs (Low Growth, Low Market Share)
               These are products that have low market shares in low-growth businesses. These products will need

        low investment but they are unlikely to be major profit earners. In practice, they may actually absorb cash
        required to hold their position. They are often regarded as unattractive for the long term and recommended

        for disposal. The general features of dogs are:
            a.  They are not profit earners
            b.  They absorb cash

            c.  They are unattractive and often recommended for disposal.


        Hofer’s Product-market Evolution Matrix

        Hofer has suggested a three-by-five matrix in which businesses are plotted according to two parameters
        viz. the firm’s business strength (competitive position) and the industry stage in the product-market life

        cycle.

               Five businesses have been shown in the above Figure 9.6. The key strategies that emerge are briefly

        explained below.
               Business A represents a product/market that has a high potential and deserves expansion strategies
        through large investments. Business B has a strong competitive position but has a product that is entering

        the shake-out stage and, therefore, needs a cautious expansion strategy. Business C is probably a ‘dog’
        while D represents a business which can be used for cash generation that could be diverted to A and B.
        Business E is a potential loser and may be considered for divestment. In this manner, the product/market

        evolution matrix portrays a company’s corporate portfolio with a high level of accuracy and completeness.


        Directional Policy Matrix (DPM)
               This matrix was developed by Shell Chemicals, UK. It uses two dimensions- viz. “business sector
        prospects  and  the  “company’s  competitive  capabilities”.  Business  sectors  prospects  are  divided  into

        attractive, average and unattractive; and company’s competitive capabilities into strong, average and weak,
        as shown in the following Figure.


                                             Figure 9.7:  Directional  Policy  Matrix














        Divestment
               Both competitive capabilities and business prospects of the business units are weak. Loss making

        units with uncertain cash flows fall in this quadrant. Since the situation is not likely to improve in the near
        future, these businesses should be divested. The resources released could be put to an alternative use.

        Phased Withdrawal
               Here the SBU is in an average to weak competitive position in the low growth unattractive business,
        with very little chance of generating enough cash flows. Gradual withdrawal from such SBUs is the strategy

        to be followed. The cash released can be invested in more profitable ventures.

                                                                                                              84]]></page><page Index="168"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                                                    Tanza Campus


        Double or Quit

               Though business prospects look attractive here the company’s competitive capabilities are weak.
        Either invest more to exploit the prospects or, if not possible, better “exit” from the SBU.
        Phased Withdrawal

               Already covered in previous page.
        Custodial
               Here both competitive capabilities and business prospects are unattractive or average. Bear with the

        situation with a little bit of help from the other product divisions or get out of the SBU so as to focus more on
        other attractive businesses.

        Try Harder
               Here business prospects are attractive, but competitive capabilities are average; strengthen their
        capabilities with infusion of additional resources.

        Cash Generation
               Here the SBU has strong competitive capabilities, but its business prospects are unattractive. Its

        operations can be continued at least for generating cash flows and profits. However, further investments
        cannot be made in view of unattractive business prospects.
        Growth

               Here the SBU has strong competitive capabilities, but its business prospects are average. This SBU
        requires additional infusion of funds. This would help the SBU to grow.
        Market Leadership

               Here the SBU has strong capabilities, and its business prospects are also attractive. It must receive
        top priority so that the SBU can retain its market leadership.


        SPACE Matrix
               The Strategic Position and Action Evaluation (SPACE) matrix is another important technique. It reveals which of the
        following strategies is most appropriate for an organization:
            1.  Aggressive strategies

            2.  Conservative  strategies
            3.  Defensive strategies
            4.  Competitive  strategies

        Aggressive Quadrant
               When a firm’s directional vector falls in the “aggressive quadrant” of the matrix. It is in an excellent
        position to use its internal strength to:

            1.  take advantage of external opportunities
            2.  overcome internal weaknesses
            3.  avoid or minimize external threats

               The  firm  can  adopt  any  of  the  aggressive  growth  strategies  like  market  penetration,  market
        development, product development, backward and forward integration, horizontal integration, concentric and

        conglomerate diversification or a combination strategy.
        Conservative Quadrant
               When a firm’s directional vector falls in the “conservative quadrant”, it means the firm should stay

        close  to  its  core  competencies  and  not  take  excessive  risks.  Conservative  strategies  include  market
        penetration, market development, product development and concentric diversification.

        Defensive Quadrant
               When the directional vector falls in the “defensive quadrant”, it suggests that the firm should focus on
        rectifying internal weaknesses and external threats, through defensive strategies. Defensive strategies or

        retrenchment strategies include turnaround, divestiture, bankruptcy or liquidation.
        Competitive Quadrant
               When  a  directional  vector  falls  in  the  “competitive  quadrant”,  the  firm  should  follow  competitive

        strategies,  which  include  backward,  forward,  and  horizontal  integration,  market  penetration;  market
        development, product development, joint ventures and strategic alliances.

          IV. CONTINGENCY STRATEGIES



        `      Strategic choice is made on the basis of certain assumptions and conditions. If the conditions change

        drastically,  the  chosen  strategies  may  have  to  be  discarded  altogether.  If  they  are  not  too  radical,  the
        strategies may have to be modified suitably. But changes do not occur in a sequential order, nor do they give
        any impending warnings. They surface suddenly leaving deep scars on the faces of managers—if they are

        unprepared. To be on the safe side, strategists always keep contingency strategies ready.
               Such  contingency  strategies  are  formulated  in  advance  to  take  care  of  unknown  events  and

        unexpected challengers. As rightly summarised by Peter Drucker, successful managers do not wait for future.
        They make the future through their proactive planning and advanced preparation. They introduce original
        action  by  removing  present  difficulties,  anticipate  future  problems,  change  the  goals  to  suit  internal  and

        external changes, experiment with creative ideas and take initiative, attempt to shape the future and create
        a more desirable environment.

          I. Strategy Implementation


               Strategy  implementation  is  the  process  of  putting  organization’s  various  strategies  into  action  by
        setting annual or short-term objectives, allocating resources, developing programmes, policies, structures,
        functional strategies etc. Even the best strategic plan will be useless unless it is implemented properly. The
        strategy implementation is, therefore, the most difficult element of the strategic management process. This
        is so because there has to be a “fit” between the strategy and the organization.
        Model for Strategy Implementation

               According to Steiner and Miner, “the implementation of policies and strategies is concerned with the
        design and management of systems to achieve the best integration of people, structures, processes and
        resources in reaching organizational purposes”. Implementation of strategy therefore involves a number of
        interrelated decisions, choices, and a broad range of activities. It requires an integration of people, structures,
        processes etc.

               Mc Kinsey’s 7-S model is good at capturing the importance of all these elements in the implementation
        of strategy.

               Super-ordinate Goals: “Super-ordinate goals” mean the “goals of a higher order which express the

        values, vision and mission that senior management brings to the organization”.
               Structure:  “Structure”  means  the  organizational  structure  of  the  company.  The  design  of
        organizational structure is a critical task of top management.

               Systems: “Systems” mean the procedures that make the organization work. They include the rules,
        regulations and procedures, both formal and informal, that complement the organizational structure. Systems
        include production planning and control systems, cost accounting procedures, capital budgeting systems,

        performance evaluation systems etc. Often, changes in strategy require changes in systems.
               Style: “Style” means the way the company conducts its business. Top managers in organizations can

        use style to bring about change.
               Staff: “Staff” refers to the pool of people who need to be developed, challenged and encouraged. It
        should be ensured that the staff has the potential to contribute to the achievement of goals.

               Skills:  “Skills”  are  the  most  crucial  attributes  or  capabilities  of  an  organization.  Skills  in  the  7-S
        framework can be considered as an equivalent of “distinctive competencies”.

               Strategy: “Strategy” is the long-term direction and scope of an organization. It is the route that the
        company has chosen to achieve competitive success.

               To implement its strategy successfully a firm must have an appropriate organizational structure. An
        organizational structure is a set of formal tasks and reporting relationships which provide a framework for
        control and coordination within the organization. The visual representation of an organizational structure is

        called organizational chart. The purpose of an organizational structure is to coordinate and integrate the
        efforts of employees at all levels – corporate, business and functional levels – so that they work together to
        achieve the specific set of strategies.


        There are two different aspects of the organizational structure:
            1.  Superstructure: This is the highly visible part of the organizational structure. This depicts how people

               are grouped into different divisions, departments and sections and how they are related to each other.
               The  superstructure  also  indicates  the  principal  ways  in  which  the  organizational  operations  are
               integrated and coordinated. By showing their levels, it indicates which groups have relatively more

               strategic importance.
            2.  Infrastructure: This is comparatively less visible part of the organizational structure. It is concerned
               with  issues  like  delegation  of  authority,  specialization,  communication,  information  systems  and





                                                                                                              89]]></page><page Index="173"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                                                    Tanza Campus


               procedures. The infrastructure enables the organization to engage in a number of disparate activities

               and still keep them coordinated.
        Basic Principles of Organizational Structure
               There are several important principles of organization, which need to be understood before building

        an organization’s structure. They are:
            1.  Hierarchy: Hierarchy defines who reports to whom and the span of control. Span of control is the
               number  of  people  reporting  to  a  supervisor.  It  determines  how  closely  a  supervisor  can  monitor

               subordinates. Tall structures have many levels in the hierarchy and a narrow span. Communication
               up and down the hierarchy becomes difficult. Flat structures are horizontally dispersed having fewer

               levels in the hierarchy. The trend in recent years has been towards flat structures allowing for wider
               spans of control as a way to facilitate better communication and co-ordination.
            2.  Chain of Command: The chain of command is an unbroken line of authority that links all persons in

               an organization and shows who reports to whom. It has two underlying principles. Unity of command
               means that each employee is held accountable to only one supervisor. The scalar principle means a

               clearly defined line of authority in the  organization. Authority and responsibility for different tasks
               should be distinct.
            3.  Specialization:  Specialization,  sometimes  called  division  of  labor,  is  the  degree  to  which

               organizational tasks are subdivided into separate jobs.
            4.  Authority, Responsibility and Delegation: Authority is the formal and legitimate right of a manager
               to make decisions, issue orders, allocate resources and command obedience. Responsibility is the

               duty to perform the task or activity an employee has been assigned. Accountability means that the
               people with authority and responsibility are subject to reporting and justifying task outcomes to those
               above them in the chain of command

            5.  Centralization and Decentralization: Centralization and decentralization refer to the level at which
               decisions  are made.  Centralization means  that  decision-making  is  done  at the top  levels  of  the

               organization. Decentralization means that decision making is pushed down to the lower levels in the
               organization.
            6.  Formalization is the extent to which written documentation is used to direct and control employees.

               Written documentation includes rules, regulations, policies, procedures, job descriptions etc.
            7.  Departmentalization:  Another  fundamental  characteristic  of  organizational  structure  is

               departmentalization, which means grouping positions into departments and departments into the total
               organization.




                                                                                                              90]]></page><page Index="174"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY

           III. BEHAVIORAL IMPLEMENTATION


        Corporate Culture and Strategic Management
               A company’s culture is manifested in the values and business principles that management preaches
        and practices.

                Example: Culture is manifested in:
        1.     Corporate stories
        2.     Attitudes and behaviors of employees

        3.     Core values
        4.     Organization’s politics

        5.     Approaches to people management and problem solving; and
        6.     Relationships with stakeholders.


        Influence of Culture on Behaviour
               An organization’s culture can exert a powerful influence on the behaviour of all employees. It can,

        therefore, strongly affect a company’s ability to adopt new strategies. A problem for a strong culture is that a
        change in mission, objectives, strategies or policies is not likely to be successful if it is in opposition to the
        culture of the company. Corporate culture has a strong tendency to resist change because its very existence

        often rests on preserving stable relationships and patterns of behavior.
        Personal Values and Ethics
               Values, personal values, and core values all refer to the same thing. They are desirable qualities,

        standards, or principles. Values are a person’s driving force and influence their actions and reactions.
               Ethics is defined as “the discipline dealing with what is good and bad, and right and wrong, or with
        moral duty and obligation.”

               Ethics refers to the moral principles and values that govern the behaviour of a person or group. Ethics
        helps us in deciding what is good or bad, moral or immoral, fair or unfair in conduct and decision-making. In

        other words, ethics serve as a “moral compass” to guide our actions.
               An ethical organization is driven by ethical values and integrity. Such values shape the search for
        opportunities, the design of systems and the decision-making processes of the organization. They

        provide a common frame of reference that serves as a unifying force across different functions and employee
        groups. Organizational ethics define what a company is and what it stands for.

               The potential benefits of an ethical organization are many. A strong ethical orientation can have a
        positive effect on employee commitment and motivation to excel. This is particularly important in today’s
        knowledge-intensive  organizations,  where  human  capital  is  critical  in  creating  value  and  competitive

        advantage. An ethically sound organization can also strengthen its bonds among its suppliers, customers
        and governmental agencies.
                                                                                                              91]]></page><page Index="175"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                                                    Tanza Campus


        Social Responsibility and Strategic Management

               Corporate social responsibility (CSR) consists of “actions that appear to further some social good,
        beyond  the  interests  of  the  firm”  It  includes  such  topics  as  environmental  ‘green’  issues,  treatment  of
        employees and suppliers, charitable work and other matters related to the community.

               A business organization has four responsibilities:
               1.      Economic  responsibilities:  are  the  most  basic  responsibilities  of  a  business  firm.  This
                       involves the essential responsibility of business to provide goods and services to society at a

                       reasonable cost. In discharging that economic responsibility, the company provides productive
                       jobs to its workforce, pays taxes to central, state and local governments.

               2.      Legal  responsibilities:  reflect  the  firm’s  obligation  to  comply  with  the  laws  that  regulate
                       business activities, especially in the areas of consumer safety and pollution control.
               3.      Ethical responsibilities: reflect the company’s notion of right or proper business behaviour.

                       Ethical responsibilities go beyond legal requirements. Firms are expected, though not legally
                       bound, to behave ethically.

               4.      Discretionary  responsibilities:  are  those  that  are  voluntarily  assumed  by  business
                       organizations that adopt the citizenship approach.

          IV. FUNCTIONAL AND OPERATIONAL IMPLEMENTATION



               Functional Strategies

                       Functional  Strategy  is  the  approach  taken  by  a  functional  area  to  achieve  corporate  and
               business  unit  objectives  and  strategies  by  maximising  resource  productivity.  It  is  concerned  with
               developing and nurturing a distinctive competence to provide a company or business unit with a

               competitive advantage. Just as a multi-divisional corporation has several business units, each with its
               own business strategy, each business unit has its own set of departments, each with its own functional

               strategy.
               Nature of Functional Strategies
                       Functional strategies are essential to implement business strategy. In fact, the effectiveness

               of a corporate or business strategy execution depends critically on the manner in which strategies are
               implemented at the functional level. The corporate strategy provides the long-term direction and scope

               of a firm. The business strategy outlines the competitive posture of its operations in an industry. The
               functional strategy clarifies the business strategy, giving specific short-term guidance to operating
               managers in the areas of operations, marketing, finance, HR, R&D etc., and increases the likelihood

               of their success.

                                                                                                              92]]></page><page Index="176"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                                                    Tanza Campus


        Functional Plans and Policies

        Functional strategies are generally formulated in these key functional areas:
            1.  Financial Strategy. In the financial management area, the major concern of the strategy relates to
               the acquisition and utilisation of funds.

            2.  Cash Flow. Apart from capital budgeting, another consideration in financial strategy which influences
               other functional areas is the cash flow.
            3.  Marketing  Strategy.  Functional  strategies  in  marketing  area  are  required  for  marketing  –  mix

               decisions,  i.e.  the  four  Ps  of  marketing,  viz.  Product  design,  Product  distribution,  Pricing  and
               Promotion aspects of marketing.

            4.  HR  strategy  deals  with  matters  like  HR  planning,  recruitment  and  selection,  training  and
               development, compensation management, performance management, rewards and incentives etc.
               What  compensation/reward  system  will  be  able  to  attract  people  of  the  desired  type  to  join  the

               organization so as to meet the task requirements demanded by the strategy? What strategies are
               necessary to groom internal people for new positions?

            5.  Production  Strategy.  The  functions  relating  to  production  need  strategies  relating  to  quality
               assurance, machine utilisation, location of facilities, balancing the line, scheduling of production, and
               materials management.

            6.  R&D Strategy. In the area of research and development, functional strategies regarding the nature
               of research are necessary. In case of expansion through new product development, heavy emphasis
               has to be laid on basic and applied research.


        Operational Plans and Policies

               Operations management is the core function of any organisation. This function converts inputs (raw
        materials, supplies, machines and people) into value added outputs. Operations management covers all
        manufacturing processes in an organisation and includes raw material sourcing, purchasing, production,

        distribution and logistics. This function contributes to the organisation’s ability to add value to the goods and
        services.
        Components of Operational Plan and Policies

               The different components of a production strategy should ideally consist of the following:
            1.  Product Mix. A firm should decide about the product mix (how many and what kind of products to be

               produced) keeping in view Objectives such as productivity, cost efficiency, Quality, reliability, flexibility
               etc.
            2.  Capacity  Planning.  Capacity  Planning  is  the  process  of  forecasting  demand  and  deciding  what

               Resources will be required to meet that demand.


                                                                                                              93]]></page><page Index="177"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY

                Instructional Objectives


               Lesson 8 covers the WEEK 16 and 17 of the course syllabus. After the completion of the lesson,
               students will be able to:

                   1.  state the nature of strategic evaluation and control;
                   2.  discuss the concept of strategic control and operational control;
                   3.  explain the techniques for strategic control; and

                   4.  identify the role of organizational systems in evaluation.




          I. Nature of Strategic Evaluation and Control


               Strategic evaluation and control is the final phase in the process of strategic management. Its basic
        purpose is to ensure that the strategy is achieving the goals and objectives set for the strategy. It compares

        performance with the desired results and provides the feedback necessary for management to take corrective
        action.

               Strategic evaluation and control is defined as the process of determining the effectiveness of a given
        strategy in achieving the organizational objectives and taking corrective actions wherever required. According
        to Pearce and Robinson, strategic control is concerned with tracking a strategy as it is being implemented,

        detecting problems or changes in its underlying premises, and making necessary adjustments. In contrast to
        post-action control, strategic control seeks to guide action on behalf of the strategies as they are taking place
        and when the end result is still several years off.

        Types of General Control Systems
        1. Output Control
               Output controls specify what is to be accomplished by focusing on the end result. This control is done

        through setting objectives, targets or milestones for each division, department, section and executives, and
        measuring actual performance. These controls are appropriate when specific output measures haven’t been

        agreed on. Often rewards and incentives are linked to performance goals.



                                                                                                              95]]></page><page Index="179"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                                                    Tanza Campus


               Example:  Sales  quotas,  specific  cost  reduction  or  profit  targets,  milestones  or  deadlines  for

        completion of projects are examples of output controls.
        2. Behaviour Control
               Behaviour controls specify how something is to be done. This control is done through policies, rules,

        standard  operating  practices  and  orders  from  superiors.  These  controls  are  the  most  appropriate  when
        performance results are hard to measure. Rules standardize the behaviour and make outcomes predictable.
        If employees follow rules, then actions are performed and decisions handled the same way time and again.

        The result is predictability and accuracy, which is the aim of all control systems. The main mechanisms of
        behaviour control are:

            1.  Operating budgets
            2.  Standard operating practices
            3.  Rules and procedures

        3. Input Control
               Input controls specify the amount of resources, such as knowledge, skills, abilities, of employees to

        be used in performance. These controls are most appropriate when output is difficult to measures.
        Basic Characteristics of Effective Evaluation and Control System
               Effective strategy evaluation systems must meet several basic requirements. They must be:

               1.      Simple: Strategy evaluation must be simple, not too comprehensive and not too restrictive.
                       Complex  systems  often  confuse  people  and  accomplish  little.  The  test  of  an  effective
                       evaluation system is its simplicity not its complexity.

               2.      Economical: Strategy evaluation activities must be economical. Too many controls can do
                       more harm than good.
               3.      Meaningful:  Strategy  evaluation  activities  should  be  meaningful.  They  should  specifically

                       relate to a firm’s objectives. They should provide managers with useful information about tasks
                       over which they have control and influence.

               4.      Timely: Strategy evaluation activities should provide timely information. For example, when a
                       firm has diversified into a new business by acquiring another firm, evaluative information may
                       be needed at frequent intervals. Time dimension of control must coincide with the time span

                       of the event being measured.
               5.      Truthful:  Strategy  evaluation  should  be  designed  to  provide  a  true  picture  of  what  is

                       happening. Information should facilitate action and should be directed to those individuals who
                       need to take action based on it.
               6.      Selective: The control systems should focus on selective criteria like key important factors

                       which are critical to performance. Insignificant deviations need not be focused. Flexible: They
                       must be flexible to take care of changing circumstances.
                                                                                                              96]]></page><page Index="180"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                                                    Tanza Campus


               7.      Suitable: Control systems should be suitable to the needs of the organization. They must

                       conform to the nature and needs of the job and area to be controlled.
               8.      Reasonable:  Control  standards  must  be  reasonable.  Frequent  measurement  and  rapid
                       reporting may frustrate control.

               9.      Objective: A control system would be effective only if it is unbiased and impersonal. It should
                       not be subjective and arbitrary. Otherwise, people may resent them.
               10.     Acceptable: Controls will not work unless they are acceptable to those who apply them.

               11.     Foster Understanding and Trust: Control systems should not dominate decisions. Rather
                       they should foster mutual understanding, trust and common sense. No department should fail

                       to cooperate with another in evaluating and control of strategies.
               12.     Fix Responsibility for Failure: An effective control system must fix responsibility for failure.
                       Detecting deviations would be meaningless unless one knows where they are occurring and

                       who is responsible for them. Control system should also pinpoint what corrective actions are
                       needed.

                       There is no ideal strategy evaluation and control system. The final design depends on the
               unique characteristics of an organization’s size, management style, purpose, problems and strengths.
        Strategic Control

               Strategic  control  is  a  type  of  “steering  control”.  We  have  to  track  the  strategy  as  it  is  being
        implemented, detect any problems or changes in the predictions made, and make necessary adjustments.
        This  is  especially  important  because the  implementation  process  itself takes  a  long  time  before  we  can

        achieve the results. Strategic controls are, therefore, necessary to steer the firm through these events.
        Types of Strategic Control
               There are four types of strategic controls:

        Premise Control
               Strategy  is  built  around  several  assumptions  or  predictions,  which  are  called  planning  premises.

        Premise control checks systematically and continuously whether the assumptions on which the strategy is
        based are still valid. If a vital premise is no longer valid, the strategy may have to be changed. The sooner
        these invalid assumptions are detected and rejected, the better are the chances of changing the strategy.

        The premise control is concerned with two types of factors:
               1.      Environmental Factors: The performance of a firm is affected by changes in environmental

                       factors like the rate of inflation, change in technology, government regulations, demographic
                       and social changes etc.
               2.      Industry Factors: Industry factors also affect the performance of a company. Competitors,
                       suppliers, buyers, substitutes, new entrants etc. are some of the industry factors about which



                                                                                                              97]]></page><page Index="181"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                                                    Tanza Campus


                       assumptions are made. If any of these assumptions go wrong, strategy may have to be
                       changed.

               Strategic Surveillance

                       Strategic surveillance is a broad-based vigilance activity in all daily operations both inside and
               outside the organization. With such vigilance, the events that are likely to threaten the course of a
               firm’s strategy can be tracked. Business journals, trade conferences, conversations, observations etc.

               are some of the information sources for strategic surveillance.
               Special Alert Control
                       Sudden, unexpected events can drastically alter the course of the firm’s strategy. Such events

               trigger an immediate and intense reconsideration of the firm’s strategy.
               Implementation control
                       It is aimed at assessing whether the plans, programmes and policies are actually guiding the

               organization towards the predetermined objectives or not. Implementation control assesses whether
               the overall strategy should be changed in the light of the results of specific  units and individuals

               involved in implementation of the strategy.
        Approaches to Strategic Control
               According to Dess, Lumpkin and Taylor, there are two approaches to strategic control.

        Traditional Approach
               Traditional approach to strategic control is sequential:

               1.      Strategies are formulated and top management sets goals
               2.      Strategies are implemented
               3.      Performance is measured against goals

               4.      Corrective measures are taken, if there are deviations.
               Control is based on a feedback loop from performance measurement to strategy formulation. This
        process typically involves lengthy time lags and often tied to a firm’s annual planning cycle. This reactive

        measure is not sufficient to control a strategy. As already explained, this is because a strategy takes a long
        period for implementation and to produce results. The uncertain future requires continuous evaluation of the
        planning  premises  and  strategy  implementation.  There  is  a  better  contemporary  approach  for  strategic

        control.
        Contemporary Approach

               Under this approach, adapting to and anticipating both internal and external environment change is
        an integral part of strategic control.
               This approach addresses the assumptions and premises that provide the foundation for the strategy.

        The key question addressed here is: do the organization’s goals and strategies still fit within the context of
        the current environment?
                                                                                                              98]]></page><page Index="182"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                                                    Tanza Campus


               This involves two key actions:

               1.      Managers must continuously scan and monitor the external and internal environment
               2.      Managers must continuously update and challenge the assumptions underlying the strategy.



           II. OPERATION CONTROL

               Operational control provides post-action evaluation and control over short periods. To be effective,
        operational control systems, involve four steps common to all post-action controls:


        1. Setting of Standards

               The first step in the control process is setting of standards. Standards are the targets against which

        the  actual  performance  will  be  measured.  They  are  broadly  classified  into  quantitative  standards  and
        qualitative standards.

               Quantitative


               These are expressed in physical or monetary terms in respect of production, marketing, finance etc.
        They may relate to:

                   1.  Time standards

                   2.  Cost standards
                   3.  Productivity standards

                   4.  Revenue standards
               Qualitative

               Qualitative criteria are also important in setting standards. Human factors such as high absenteeism

        and turnover rates, poor production quality or low employee satisfaction can be the underlying causes of
        declining performance. So, qualitative standards also need to be established to measure performance.

        2. Measurement of Performance


               The second step in operational control is the measurement of actual performance. Here, the actual
        performance  is measured  against  the  standards fixed.  Standards  of  performance  act  as  the  benchmark

        against which the actual performance is to be compared. It is important, however, to understand how the
        measurement of performance actually takes place. Operationally measuring is done through accounting,
        reporting and communication systems. A variety of evaluation techniques are used for this purpose, which

        are explained in the next section. The other important aspects of measurement relates to:


                                                                                                              99]]></page><page Index="183"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                                                    Tanza Campus


        Difficulties in Measurement

               There are several activities for which it is difficult to set standards and measure performance.
        Example:  Performance  of  a  worker  in  terms  of  units  produced  in  a  day,  week  or  month  can  easily  be
        measured.  On  the  other  hand,  it  is  not  easy  to  measure  the  contribution  of  a  manager  or  to  assess

        departmental performance. The solution lays in developing verifiable objectives, stated in quantitative and
        qualitative terms, against which performance can be measured.
        Timing of Measurement

               Timing refers to the point of time at which measurement should take place. Delay in measurement or
        measuring before time can defeat the very purpose of measurement. So measurement should take place at

        critical points in a task schedule, which could be at the end of a definable activity or the conclusion of a task.
                Example:  In  a  project  implementation  schedule,  there  could  be  several  critical  points  at  which
        measurement would take place.

        Periodicity in Measurement
               Another important issue in measurement is “how often to measure”. Generally, financial statements

        like budgets, balance-sheets, and profit and loss accounts are prepared every year. But there are certain
        reports like production reports, sales reports etc. which are done on a daily, weekly, monthly basis.

        3. Identifying Deviations

               The third step in the control process is identifying deviations. The measurement of actual performance
        and its comparison with standards of performance determines the degree of deviation or variation between
        actual performance and the standard. Broadly, the following three situations may arise:

            1.     The actual performance matches the standards
            2.     The actual performance exceeds the standards

            3.     The actual performance falls short of the standards
        4. Taking Corrective Action
               The last and final step in the operational control process is taking corrective action. Corrective action

        is initiated by the management to rectify the shortfall in performance.
        If the performance is consistently low, the strategists have to do an in depth analysis and diagnosis to isolate
        the factors responsible for such low performance and take appropriate corrective actions.

               There are three courses for corrective action:
               1.      Checking performance
               2.      Checking standards

               3.      Reformulating strategies, plans and objectives.

         III. Techniques of Strategic Control


               Organizations  use  many  techniques  or  mechanisms  for  strategic  control.  Some  of  the  important
        mechanisms are:

            1.  Management  Information  systems:  Appropriate  information  systems  act  as  an  effective  control

               system. Management will come to know the latest performance in key areas and take appropriate
               corrective measures.
            2.  Benchmarking: It is a comparative method where a firm finds the best practices in an area and then

               attempts to bring its own performance in that area in line with the best practice. Best practices are the
               benchmarks  that  should  be  adopted  by  a  firm  as  the  standards  to  exercise  operational  control.

               Through this method, performance can be evaluated continually till it reaches the best practice level.
               In order to excel, a firm shall have to exceed the benchmarks. In this manner, benchmarking offers
               firms a tangible method to evaluate performance.

            3.  Balanced scorecard: It is a method based on the identification of four key performance measures
               i.e. customer perspective, process perspective, innovation perspective, and the financial perspective.

               This method is a balanced approach to performance measurement as a range of financial and non-
               financial parameters are taken into account for evaluation.


























               4.      Key factor rating: It is a method that takes into account the key factors in several areas and

                       then sets out to evaluate performance on the basis of these. This is quite a comprehensive
                       method as it takes a holistic view of the performance areas in an organisation.






                                                                                                             101]]></page><page Index="185"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                                                    Tanza Campus


               5.      Responsibility Centres: Control systems can be established to monitor specific functions,

                       projects  or  divisions.  Responsibility  centers  are  used  to  isolate  a  unit  so  that  it  can  be
                       evaluated  separately  from  the  rest  of  the  corporation.  There  are  five  major  types  of
                       responsibility centers: Cost centres, Revenue centres, Expense centres, Profit centres and

                       Investment centres. Each responsibility centre has its own budget and is evaluated on the
                       basis of its performance.
               6.      Network  techniques:  Network  techniques  such  as  Programme  Evaluation  and  Review

                       Technique (PERT), Critical Path Method (CPM), and their variants, are used extensively for
                       the  operational  controls  of  scheduling  and  resource  allocation  in  projects.  When  network

                       techniques are modified for use as a cost accounting system, they become highly effective
                       operational controls for project costs and performance.
               7.      Management by Objectives (MBO): It is a system proposed by Drucker, which is based on

                       a regular evaluation of performance against objectives which are decided upon mutually by
                       the superior and the subordinate. By the process of consultation, objective-setting leads to the

                       establishment of a control system that operates on the basis of commitment and self-control.
                       Thus, the scope of MBO to be used as an operational control is quite extensive.

          IV. Role of Organizational Systems in Evaluation



               There are six types of organisational system involved in evaluation.

               Information System
                       Organisations  evaluate  by  comparing  actual  performance  with  standards.  Purpose  of
               information management system is to enable managers to keep the track of performance through

               control reports. Whether strategic surveillance or financial analysis, are based on information system
               to provide relevant & timely data to managers to allow them to evaluate performance & strategy &

               initiate corrective action
               Control System
                       The  control  system  is  core  of  any  evaluation  process  &  is  used  for  setting  standards,

               measuring performance, analysing variances, & taking corrective action.
               Appraisal System

                       This is the system that actually evaluates performance. When measuring the performance of
               managers, it is contribution to the organisational objectives which is sought to be measured. The
               evaluation process through appraisal system, measure the actual performance and provides for the

               control system to work.

                                                                                                             102]]></page><page Index="186"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                                                    Tanza Campus


               Motivation System

                       The primary role of the motivation system is to induce strategically desirable behavior so that
               managers are encouraged to work towards the achievement of organisational objectives. This system
               plays an important role in ensuring that deviations of actual performance with standards. Performance

               checks, which are a feedback in the evaluation process, are done through the motivation process.
               Development System
                       The development system prepares the managers for performing strategic & operational tasks.

               Among the several aims of development, the most important is to match a person with the job to be
               performed. This in other words is matching actual performance with standards. This matching can be

               done  provided  it  is  known  what  a  manager  is  required  to  do  and  what  is  deficient  in  terms  of
               knowledge, skills & attitude. Such a deficiency is located through the appraisal system. The role of
               development system in evaluation is to help the strategists to initiate & implement corrective action.

               Planning System
                       The evaluation process also provides feedback to planning systems for the reformulation of

               strategies, plans & objectives. Thus planning system closely interacts with the evaluation process on
               a continual basis.

                Instructional Objectives


               Lesson 1 covers the WEEK 2 of the course syllabus. After the completion of the lesson, students

               1.  Define consumer behavior.

               2.  Determine the importance of consumer behavior in marketing and the reason why it is called
                   as the essence of marketing.

               3.  Identify the theoretical frameworks that can be used to understand consumer behavior and how

                   each of them contributes to the study of consumer behavior.

               4.  Discuss  how  culture  considered  as  a  powerful  determinant  of  human  behavior  and  how  it
                   influence marketing.
               5.   Identify the influence of digitalization on consumer behavior and discuss how a marketer can

                   use digital tools for the success of one’s marketing goals.

          I. DEFINITION OF CONSUMER BEHAVIOR

            Consumer behavior is a rapidly growing discipline of study. It means more than just how a person buys
        products. It is a complex and multidimensional process and reflects the totality of consumers’ decisions with

        respect  to  acquisition,  consumption  and  disposal  activities.  We,  as  consumers,  exhibit  very  significant
        differences in our buying behavior and play an important role in local, national or international economic

        conditions. One of the very few aspects common to all of us is that we are all consumers and the reason for
        a business firm to come into being is the presence of consumers who have unfulfilled, or partially fulfilled
        needs and wants. No matter who we are – urban or rural, male or female, young or old, rich or poor, educated

        or uneducated, believer or non-believer, or whatever – we are all consumers. We consume or use on a
        regular  basis food,  shelter,  clothing,  education, entertainment,  brooms,  toothbrushes,  vehicles,  domestic
        help, healthcare and other services, necessities, comforts, luxuries and even ideas etc. Organizations realize

        that their marketing effectiveness in satisfying consumer needs and wants at a profit depends on a deeper
        understanding  of  consumer  behavior.  Our  consumption  related  behavior  influences  the  development  of
        technology and introduction of new and improved products and services.




                                                                                                                1]]></page><page Index="190"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY

            To succeed in a dynamic marketing environment, marketers have an urgent need to learn and anticipate
        whatever  they  can  about  consumers.  The  better  they  know  and  understand  consumers,  the  more
        advantageous it would prove in accomplishing their organizational objectives. Marketers want to know what

        consumers think, what they want, how they work, how they entertain themselves, how they play etc. They
        also  need  to  comprehend  personal  and  group  influences  which  have  a  significant  impact  on  consumer
        decision-making process.


        “Consumer  behavior  refers  to  the  actions  and  decision  processes  of  people  who  purchase  goods  and
        services for personal consumption.”
                                                         James F Engel, Roger D Blackwell and Paul W Miniard,
                                                                  “Consumer Behavior” (Dryden Press, 1990)

        Consumer behavior refers to “the mental and emotional processes and the physical activities of people who
        purchase and use goods and services to satisfy particular needs and wants.”
                                                        Bearden et al. “Marketing Principles and Perspectives.”

        “The behavior that consumers display in searching for, purchasing, using, evaluating and disposing of, if
        products and services that they expect will satisfy their needs.”
                                             Leon G Schiffman and Leslie Lazar Kanuk, ‘Consumer Behavior’,
                                                                               Prentice-Hall of India, 4th ed. 1991

        Consumer behavior refers to “the mental and emotional processes and the observable behavior of consumers
        during searching, purchasing and post consumption of a product or service.”
                                                                                                         Authors


               How consumers make decisions to spend their available resources such as money, time and effort

        on consumption and use related items is the subject of consumer behavior study. Consumer behavior has
        two aspects: the final purchase activity which is visible to us and the decision process which may involve the
        interplay of a number of complex variables not visible to us. In fact, purchase behavior is the end result of a

        long process of consumer decision making. The study involves what consumers’ buy, why they buy it, how
        they buy it, when they buy it, where they buy it, how frequently they buy it and how they dispose of the product
        after use.



             II. IMPORTANCE OF CONSUMER BEHAVIOR


               There are three basic factors why Consumer Behavior is important. It is necessary to talk about each
        of  these  factors  before  starting  with  certain  basic  principles  associated  with  Consumer  Behavior.  It  is
        important  to  understand  the  impact  of  consumer  behavior  on  marketing  strategies  before  proceeding  to

        consumer behavior concepts.






                                                                                                                2]]></page><page Index="191"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY

               Consumer Behavior as the essence of marketing is synergized with the following directions. The three
        directions or factors are:
        1. The consumer mind itself acts as a direction;

        2. The environmental direction; and

        3. The organizational direction.

               These are the three factors that emphasize the importance of consumer  behavior to marketeers.
        Essentially, the context in which consumer behavior is applied could be different, but the underlying principles

        of Consumer Behavior are the same.
        Consumer Behavior as the Essence of Marketing
               The  first  factor  is  associated  with  consumer  behavior  as  the  essence  of  marketing.  This  factor

        elaborates on how consumer behavior tries to enhance and harness several other subjects associated with
        marketing.
               For example, if we consider retailing management, retailing in a shopping context can never happen

        without consumer behavior. This could be associated with the point of purchase aspects or the impulsivity
        aspects of consumer or the visual merchandising, which is done by a particular retailer; and there could be
        many other aspects as well. This holds good for mundane products which are shopped by the ordinary people

        as well as for luxury products, which are only within the reach of a few consumers or economically on a higher
        plane.

               Let us take the example of advertising management. Almost 50 years back, the concept of brand
        positioning was pioneered by stalwarts Ries and Trout. Brand positioning is associated with the unique image
        created by the offering in the mind of the consumer. When I say offering, it refers to a specific brand. How

        can a brand manager or a marketing manager get into brand positioning without having an idea of Consumer
        Behavior?
               Let us consider yet another aspect of marketing, which is customer relationship management or CRM.

        Essentially, customer relationship is based on the behavioral aspects of human beings. So, CRM is not about
        marketing,  it is not about branding, and it is very much about people. Without understanding Consumer
        Behavior, it is extremely difficult to strategize several aspects of CRM or customer relationship management.

        Let us take online retailing or digitalization. Consumer Behavior is important even for digitalization. Let us
        take the example of Amazon or Flipkart or any other online retailer. The online retailer today talks about Big

        Data, which is associated with analytics and which is associated with Data science. It is only Consumer
        Behavior  that  could  provide  valuable  insights  for  marketeers  of  online  retailing;  to  segment  markets,  to
        customize offering and to connect with consumers in real time.

               So, Consumer Behavior interface is extremely important to any aspect of marketing because it brings
        with it an experiential aspect associated with the experience of consumers which will otherwise be missing.





                                                                                                                3]]></page><page Index="192"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY

        The Consumer Mindset as Direction
               Why is consumer mindset a direction? This is because the central pillar which several of the other
        directions need to take cues from consumer mindset.

               Brand differentiation can be done on several ways. It can be done with respect to the functional
        attributes. It can be done with respect to the consumers emotions. It can be done with respect to several
        aspects that are concerned with the psychological nature of the consumers. It can be done with respect to

        consumer sense of belongingness to their groups or friends or families. It can be done with respect to the
        sensual or experiential pleasure experienced by the consumers. It can also be done with respect to a solution
        given by a brand, as in the case of painting a house that was initiated by a paint company like Asian Paints.

        There are several ways in which the consumer's mind can be approached by the marketeer. The fundamental
        point to be noted is that given a situation where functional attributes of a product are on an even keel with

        respect  to  other  products  in  the  same  category,  then  it  is  only  the  psychological  aspects  of  Consumer
        Behavior that can bring the kind of differentiation that makes a brand competitive.
               Let  us  discuss  some  examples  with  respect  to  soaps,  mobiles,  watches  and  apparel.  There  are

        several ways in which a brand can get itself differentiated. When we talk about brands which are there in the
        same price band, the differentiation on functional features is almost insignificant in several categories. Even

        if  the  differentiation  is  possibly  obtained  by  a  brand  with  respect  to  its  functional  features,  there  will  be
        competitors  who  are  following  suit.  Besides  the  psychological  aspects  of  differentiation  are  significant
        because  there  is  a  likelihood  of  the  consumer  forming  a  relationship  with  the  brand  just  as  we  form

        relationships with other people.
               Let us take the case of a well-known brand which was launched possibly during the mid-eighties. The
        name is HeroHonda, and the brand differentiation was simple - “Fill it, shut it, forget it”. This proposition

        conveyed  the  effectiveness  of  petrol  consumption  with  respect  to  motorcycle  category.  The  brand  was
        launched at a time where most of the brands were giving almost half the kind of mileage associated with
        HeroHonda. HeroHonda had launched a brand on the functional proposition. The advertising and positioning

        of a brand had created an attitude that ensured that the brand was highly successful. This is an example of
        a brand that created a functional proposition and succeeded.

               In contrast to the Hero Honda, let us consider the positioning of Red Bull. Red Bull is an energy drink
        which is oriented towards young target segment. Red Bull, of course, has more caffeine and it keeps the
        consumer awake, but essentially, the proposition of Red Bull is its association with energy and parties that

        youngsters  indulge  in.  Hence  in  terms  of  functional  proposition,  it  is  subjugated  to  the  psychological
        proposition of belongingness as associated with youngsters and parties and so on. Red Bull symbolizes the

        party going fun related to youngsters, and party going is the in thing with respect to young groups.
               Consumer  Behavior  as  a  direction  taking  into  account  the  mindset  of  the  consumer  also  has  to
        connect with the lifestyles of consumers. Let us take a look at the Indian environment when we consider a

        product like Quaker Oats- it is in line with the lifestyle focusing on fitness and health. It is be noted that food
        is an innate part of the culture, and it is extremely difficult to change the habits of consumers with respect to

                                                                                                                4]]></page><page Index="193"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                     Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus

        food habits in any part of the world. Today, with the culture of fitness and health getting into the awareness
        of urban consumers. Quaker Oats is slowly becoming a routine with respect to the breakfast of several
        consumers in the urban cities.

               Let us take the example of lifestyle connected with online shopping with respect to apparel. Myntra is
        a brand that has made use of the current fashion of online shopping and the concept of one's apparel as a
        reflection  of  once  self  which  is  associated  with  personality.  So,  personalities  another  aspect  of  the

        psychological dimension associated with Consumer Behavior.
               There are several kinds of brands that get associated with the lifestyles of consumers. Nescafe is an
        instant coffee that is into the lifestyle of urban consumers. It is just not positioned on the convenience of

        making coffee. It is positioned on the psychological aspects of making enjoyable moments more enjoyable
        with a cup of Nescafe.

               Consumer Behavior as a mindset also connects with rituals in the consumer's mind. The ritual in
        simple terms is a routine activity of a consumer which is repeated in a fixed sequence over a period of time.
        The purpose of the ritual can either be symbolic or functional. Functional could be with respect to hunger,

        and the symbolic aspect of ritual could be with respect to celebrations.
               Let us take the case of coconut oil. Coconut oil is something that has been used for the ritual of

        grooming hair for the last several decades. Parachute is a brand that has converted the opportunity into
        branding and has launched several sub brands associated with the ritual of grooming. For decades, there
        were hair creams with respect to grooming. Brylcream was one of them. Aftershower was one of the brands

        of parachute that became a success with respect to the younger segment. The timing of Aftershower as a
        part of the bathing ritual, and the delivery of hair care benefit in the form of a cream made it a success.
               So, another point that should be been noted is also the timing associated with launch of a brand.

        Parachute got into the grooming rituals of several other kinds of targets segments. For example, there is a
        cultural practice of applying the oil before bath and the cultural practice is quite traditional in several parts of
        the country. Parachute introduced hot oil that consumers can apply before bath. Parachute also has an herbal

        offering for the grooming rituals of consumers.
        The Environmental Direction

               The next aspect that is in line with the importance of consumer behavior is environmental direction.
        Speaking  of  environmental  direction,  the  entire  world  has  changed  over  the  last  couple  of  decades.
        Essentially,  as  the  environment  changes,  product  proliferation  happens,  brand  proliferation  happens,

        consumer lifestyle changes, and all of them are triggered by environmental factors at a very macro level.
               Environmental  factors  can  be  associated  with  technology.  It  can  be  associated  with  government

        policies. It can be associated with a particular trend with respect to consumers’ fashion and it could also be
        associated with economic recession as well as economic well-being. If we have to take into consideration the
        Phlippine context which is extremely diverse with respect to its consumers and culture, the environmental

        factors play an important role.



                                                                                                                5]]></page><page Index="194"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY

               Let  us  consider  a  city  like  Manila,  where  there  are  different  kinds  of  consumers  ranging  from
        consumers  who  shop  in  small  shops  to  wealthy  consumers  who  shop  in  an  international  ambiance.  A
        knowledge of consumer behavior is required for the analysis of both these segments.

               Before liberalization, the marketing context in the Philippines was completely different. So, when we
        think of environmental directions, we need to think of the post-liberalization and the pre-liberalization periods
        of time in our country.

               Let us take a look at some of the product categories in India that will tell us more about how the
        environment has changed over a period of time: -
               Currently, India has multinational cars from several advanced countries, and consumers can choose

        from a wide variety of offerings. But before liberalization, there was only Ambassador or Fiat as brands in
        India. Then slowly Maruti started opening up the market before the marketplace was full of different kinds of

        car brands. When we consider motorcycle as a category pre 80s was dominated by two brands Yezdi’s and
        Java. At a later point in time, we had different kinds of brands coming into the Indian scenario to make a
        mark. In fact, even Yezdi and Java have been relaunched again in the present-day context. If you take

        example from the footwear industry, Bata was ruling the roost before the 80s, and today there are a host of
        other brands which are there in the competitive scenario. We can go on and on with the categories to reflect

        how environment has changed over a period of time.
               Technology, of course, is an important part of the environmental direction. And the introduction of
        smartphones  in  the  Indian  context  provides  ample  evidence  about  the  online  surfing  with  respect  to

        smartphones, and customized ads with respect to smartphone users, and several other related aspects. The
        point to be noted is that some of these brands can be identified at the behavioral level of the consumer, and
        that is the reason why Consumer Behavior is extremely important. When it comes to some of these brands,

        it means that the behavioral orientation associated with brands vary depending on the context and depending
        on the brand strategies.
        The Organizational Direction

               With respect to Organizational Direction, Philip Kotler's advocacy on Holistic Marketing is extremely
        important. Philip Kotler, in his basic principles of marketing, has dealt with the holistic concept associated

        with marketing. The holistic concept brings in the customer orientation into an organization. The internal
        marketing aspects of the holistic marketing is a very strong aspect of holistic marketing, and Consumer
        Behavior makes a tremendous contribution to the concept of internal marketing.

               Internal marketing brings together several departments in an organization to ensure the organization
        is customer centric. And Consumer Behavior plays an important role in terms of its integration with holistic

        marketing.
               A typical example of this could be the case of ITC. ITC is a large organization that was manufacturing
        cigarettes. And over a period of time, in order to reduce the dependence on cigarettes, the company has

        branched off into many other categories, and that in fact, is an attempt by the organization to come to grips



                                                                                                                6]]></page><page Index="195"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                     Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus

        with environmental changes. ITC, for example, has moved into commodities, soaps, shampoos, chocolates,
        detergents, diary, and coffee to name a few categories.
               Let  us  consider  another  example  with  respect  to  one  of  the  ITC's  product  Aashirvad  wheat.

        Essentially, wheat is a commodity. A commodity is something which is traded more on the price aspects. A
        brand is supposed to enhance the value of the offering. Aashirvad has not only achieved a higher mark and
        quality, it is able to dispense out different kinds of offerings with respect to different kinds of wheat as preferred

        by specific geographical areas and the respective cultures.
               Several of these aspects would not be possible without Consumer Behavior becoming the core part
        of internal marketing. ITC has also strategically used the holistic aspects with respect to its supply chain. The

        supply chain is something which ITC has been able to streamline with respect to its relationship with several
        farmers over a period of several decades. The point to be noted is that several aspects of holistic marketing

        converge, and the converging point is Consumer Behavior.

               III. CONSUMER BEHAVIOR FRAMEWORKS

               The foremost important aspect of consumer behavior is that it does not have an identity of its own. It

        is  inter-disciplinary  in  nature  bringing  together  several  aspects  connected  with  Psychology,  Sociology,
        Anthropology, Artificial intelligence, Evolutionary biology, and any other aspect of the mind that can be applied
        with respect to consumers.

               In fact, in the recent times, neuro marketing and physiological aspects of consumer behavior are also
        being investigated. The interdisciplinary nature of consumer behavior is in fact the unique selling proposition

        of consumer behavior. Consumer behavior consists of the individual processes which the consumer as an
        individual puts into action. This is with respect to how he or she feels, thinks and acts.
               The individual processes in the course are discussed in an individual manner, but in terms of the

        working in consumers mind they are all simultaneously working together, and different types of individual
        processes can be attributed to different kinds of context. The individual processes, for example, could be how

        consumers perceive different kinds of things in the environment. It could be associated with how they learn
        about the environment and the brands.
               Attitude is something which is associated with frames of references that consumers have and make

        use of when they get into decision making. For example, what is a quick frame of reference or attitude with
        respect to a set of consumers on a given category, like cars or soaps? What are the criteria they make use

                                                                                                                7]]></page><page Index="196"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                     Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus

        of with respect to brand decision making? What is the attitude with respect to the consumer on sports? What
        is the attitude with respect to religion? There are different facets of life, and with respect to each facet of life
        the consumer develops an attitude. The attitude is associated with beliefs, feelings and behavioral aspects,

        and these are extremely important aspects from the viewpoint of branding.
               Personality is another individual process. Personality is strongly connected with the motivation for the
        individual. How a consumer’s personality and motivation influence their marketing goals and the selection of

        brands makes an interesting contribution to consumer behavior.
               Another important aspect of Consumer Behavior is a manner in which the consumer interacts with
        groups of other consumers or their friends or their families. These are all different kinds of groups that exert

        an influence on the consumer's mind, which in turn exerts an influence on their decision making with respect
        to brands. These kinds of groups can be called as “reference groups”.

               “Reference groups” is a concept that has an impact on consumers, their decisions, their thinking and
        attitude, and it is fundamental when it is associated with certain kinds of decision making. In fact, the onset
        of social media has recreated the interest with respect to the concept of reference groups because social

        media is all about sharing. The different ways in which consumers make use of their interaction with reference
        groups through their social media behavior is a topical aspect in the study of Consumer Behavior.

               Another part which is extremely important in consumer behavior is culture. In simple terms, culture is
        “shared learning”. How consumers share their learning and how it gets passed on from one generation to
        another- is the essence of culture. Culture is a combination of beliefs, customs, arts, language, food, and

        everything associated with consumers in a specific social context or culture.
               For example, the Asian culture is very different from the European culture. Even with respect of the
        Asian culture, there could be cultural differences with respect to urban college students and rural college

        students, there are cultural differences between software professionals and other kinds of professionals,
        there could be cultural differences between professors and businesspersons.
               Cultural learning is very specific to a social context. For example, cultural aspects of religion and

        values are important in the Indian context, to the extent that they even influence the choices when it comes
        to  foods.  Drawing  an  example  from  the  marketing  context-  India,  perhaps  is  the  only  country  where

        McDonald's or the McDo doesn’t have a beef offering with respect to the food it serves. This is because the
        brand would like to respect the religious value of Indians.
               Values pervade into every aspect of our life, and cultural values are extremely important from the

        viewpoint of marketing. For example, herbal offerings associated with Ayurveda has a strong cultural root,
        and there could be several kinds of brand beliefs associated with Ayurveda. Today we have companies like

        Unilever, Himalaya and several other brands that market herbal offerings. We talk about green products or
        environmental products, and herbal offering form an important part of the cultural beliefs.
               For example, Santoor soap which is very successful with respect to its foray in the Indian context uses

        turmeric and there are several cultural beliefs associated with turmeric and sandalwood. Sandalwood is also
        used by the some of the variants of Santoor. And these beliefs are concerned with the ability of the herbs to

                                                                                                                8]]></page><page Index="197"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                     Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus

        take care of the consumer’s complexion. So, one can notice how the cultural aspects form an inherent part
        of the respective brand position.
               Cultural beliefs associated with mother and children is something special in the Philippine context.

        Let  us  consider  the  advertisement  involving  mother  and  children  over  the  last  sixty  years  in  a  host  of
        categories. That will probably give us some idea about how important mother and child are in the Philippine
        context when it comes advertising. Till date, even in the digital era, mother-child association is carried on by

        brands.
               Let us get into unconventional example concerned with cultural aspects. Dating as a cultural habit is
        not accepted by the mainstream population of India. This is not to say that dating is absent in urban context.

        This is only to emphasize that it is not a traditional belief, or a traditional value associated with Indians. When
        the brand Tinder which is to do with the dating service entered into the Indian context, it ran an advertising

        campaign in India that was associated to mother and daughter. The ad shows the mother encouraging the
        daughter to use the dating application. It is an attempt from the brand to capitalize on the idea “mommy knows
        the best”. The brand believed that the idea of a mother recommending the dating app to the daughter would

        neutralize the awkwardness that Indians associate with dating.
               So, one can see that a clear understanding of the cultural influences on the consumer’s perception of

        a category can enable a brand to introduce new kinds of values despite the presence of strongly entrenched
        traditional values that are opposing in nature.

              IV. CULTURAL SYMBOLISM


               Another interesting aspect with respect to consumer behavior is Cultural Symbolism. It is to be noted
        that any activity associated with marketing happens in the context of culture. This is not only true with respect

        to the Philippine context; this also holds good for any aspect of marketing in any part of the world. Cultural
        symbolism is associated with how cultural aspects play a role in symbolizing certain cultural practices or
        habits.

               Let us take the interesting example of Dettol. Dettol is an antiseptic. And perhaps most consumers
        may not be as involved in an antiseptic as they are with an upmarket, higher-priced to watch. Given the

        history of Dettol in Philippines and its usage by consumer segments, Dettol stings upon the application on a
        wound. It has a specific odor. When we talk about cultural symbolism, the fundamental question is- have
        consumers got used to the stinging sensation and a different kind of odor of Dettol to associate it with the

        curative powers of an antiseptic?



                                                                                                                9]]></page><page Index="198"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                     Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus

               In this case, there is also some kind of sensory branding which comes into the picture. Smelling is a
        kind of sensation; sense of touch is associated with the burning sensation that is created by the brand Dettol.
        So essentially, it is a combination of cultural symbolism and experiential aspects of the brand associated with

        the curative power of Dettol that has created a strong positioning in terms of cultural symbolism.
               Even  in  the  case  of  pain  balm  it  is  very  common  to  find  consumers  trying  to  look  for  a  burning
        sensation as a reflection of brands efficacy in terms of bringing down pain. So, this specific aspect of the

        consumers’ expectations of a pain balm trying to create a hot sensation on application is an example of
        cultural symbolism.
               Let us take another example which is from the commonplace aspects of Consumer Behavior in the

        Indian context. Rusk is made with breadcrumbs and it is an extremely popular product in several parts of the
        country. Rusk has been consumed by Indians for the last several decades. It is not uncommon to find people

        in a roadside tea stall enjoying their conversation over rusk. The recent times Britannia has branded rusk and
        positioned it as a conversation trigger. Rusk in the advertisement of Britannia symbolizes fun times, good
        times and conversations that are a part of a pleasure among a group of consumers. This example shows

        how cultural symbolism can be portrayed with specific advertising in a specific context.
               One of the most interesting cases with respect to cultural symbolism is the case of Kellogg's in the

        Indian context. Possibly only in the Indian context, Kellogg's advertised that Kellogg's corn flakes need to be
        taken with hot milk whereas in several other parts of the world corn flakes is consumed with cold milk. The
        cultural symbolism here is all about hot milk, the fullness, and the food becoming tasty with the addition of

        hot  milk.  Milk  is  a  central  part  of  the  Indian  culture,  and  the  practice  and  ritual  of  heating  milk  before
        consumption has been taken into account in the advertising strategy of Kellogg. In a country with a diverse
        cultural orientation, cultural symbolism plays an important role in consumer behavior.

               V. DIGITALIZATION AND CONSUMER BEHAVIOR



               The traditional four-Ps of marketing namely: Product, Price, Promotion, and Place have been in place
        with respect to the marketing context and the marketeer strategies. At this point in time, as we study the

        importance of the basic principles of Consumer Behavior, we need to be familiar with application of four-Ps
        of marketing before moving into Consumer Behavior. This is because Consumer Behavior gets enhanced
        and harnessed with the understanding of the basic principles like segmentation, brand equity, product line

        management, and advertising management. The traditional Ps of marketing are probably one of fundamental
        ways in which brand differentiation is achieved.

                                                                                                              10]]></page><page Index="199"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                     Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus

               Philip Kotler had introduced the Four Cs of the digital world.
               The fourth Cs are:
               1. Co-creation,

               2. Communal exchanges,
               3. Conversations and
               4. Currency.

               Co-creation is probably the ultimate dream of marketeers. Co-creation is associated with creating a
        product or service with active participation of the consumer with respect to their preferences and needs. The
        next stop for several other brands, especially in online marketing, would be to co-create the offerings at the

        ultimate level of catering to individual preferences and needs. In the Indian context a typical example of co-
        creation is the manner in which companies like Asian Paints tried to create some kind of co-creation in terms

        of taking into account the consumer preferences for colors that they use in their homes.
               Currency is associated with the extent to which consumers provide continuous revenue associated
        with the brand. I'd like to remind the students that Theodore Levitt several decades back talked about every

        product becoming a service, and this is about to become a reality. For instance, in the days to come possibly
        consumers may not be interested in detergents; they may be interested completely in laundry services which

        detergent is only a part of. We already have online laundry services which have been introduced in the Indian
        context.
               Coming back to currency as a revenue stream, the fundamental challenge of digital world for every

        brand is to ensure that the revenue is generated with respect to the brands offerings. And we will see more
        of services being introduced with almost every brand in every category, depending on the consumer segment
        associated with the brand.

               Communal  exchanges  today  are  seen  with  respect  to  websites  like  eBay  and  Olx.  These  are
        websites which have created the culture of consumers exchanging goods and products among themselves.
               Finally, conversation is about how well the word of mouth is harnessed favorably by brands in the

        digital world. The word of mouth in the digital world has got two directions: one is positive and the other one
        is negative. Word of mouth is important both for services as well as brands and brands, and services get built

        up on word of mouth.
               When we consider an example from the personal beauty segment in the Philippines, a brand like Luxe
        Organix serves to illustrate how word of mouth would work in the consumer's minds. Luxe Organix is a brand

        which has a positive word of mouth in the social media. The brand hardly advertises but still has a high level
        of loyal consumers. On the other hand, we have the global example of Galaxy from Samsung caught in

        negative word of mouth. So, word of mouth or conversations can have bi-polar directions and the brand
        needs to be conscious of the same.
               Coming back to the traditional Ps and the contemporary Cs of marketing, your marketeer today has

        to  ensure  that the traditional  Ps  of marketing  are  well  synergized  and  integrated  with  the  contemporary
        aspects of the digital world.

                                                                                                              11]]></page><page Index="200"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                     Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus

               • The revival of SunSilk brand of shampoo in the reason times with its website on the SunSilk gang
        of girls, is an excellent example of how word of mouth builds up a brand among the target consumers.
               • Parle-G, which is consumed by both the rich and the poor, had come out with the social media

        campaign that emphasizes the relationship between a consumer and Parle-G.
               So social media makes use of the word of mouth, and the brand needs to ensure it monitors the social
        media as appropriate. It must be noted that consumer behavior is dynamic, exciting, and challenging in any

        competitive context.

              I. IMPORTANCE OF SEGMENTATION AND BRAND POSITIONING

               After the initial session on the introduction to consumer behavior, this lesson will discuss the topic of

        segmentation and brand positioning. At a fundamental level, let us explore the concept of Segmentation and
        its relevance to consumer behavior.
               There are a number of reasons why segmentation is required. The first and foremost reason is that

        the environment is changing in a number of ways. Several decades back, the car manufacturer, like Toyota
        in the Philippines had only one offering. During the initial stages of the seller's market, the specification of the

        car was more at the product category level. The differentiation with respect to a brand was not very intense.
        Over a period of time with consumerism setting in, the purchasing power of consumers had gone up, and as
        a consequence, the preferences of consumers had also changed. This led to brand proliferation. Therefore,

        there is a distinctive need to offer specific benefits at the brand level for a group of target consumers. A typical
        brand in most categories today would have specific product offerings for different kinds of consumers who

        have a similar need.


                                                                                                              13]]></page><page Index="203"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                     Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus

               The fundamental assumption behind segmentation is that different consumers would require different
        benefits  from  the  same  category  and  would  be  willing  to  pay  for  it.  The  follow  up  assumption  at  the
        organizational level is that the firm would focus its resources on the selected segments and thereby on profits.

        This  particular  assumption  from  the  organizational  level  ensures  that  the  organization  has  a  strategic
        advantage in terms of catering to the specific needs of a specific segment. It is to be noted that a given
        segment for a company needs to be profitable as I had said earlier.

               Let us take for example the soap category. In the Philippines, there are different brands of soap
        catering to different kinds of consumers. There is Dove the beauty soap. There is Himalaya, which is a herbal
        soap and then there is a brand called Safeguard, which is a antibacterial soap. Then there is a brand called

        Lux that has been using by the celebrities for the last several decades. Lux brand promises skincare and it
        is endorsed by film celebrities. There is a brand called Silka that has cultural ingredients of papaya and other

        herbal plants that promises youthful skin for a consumer to look younger than her age. There is a soap called
        Kojie San that has kojic acid which promises whiter and clearer skin.
               As one can see, different consumer segments require different benefits, and that is the reason why

        segmentation is required. Besides, the different kinds of consumers perceived that their needs are met by
        the respective offering.

        Brand Benefits
               Brands offer specific benefits. So, when we talk about segmentation in consumer markets, we are
        talking about brand benefits. When we take into account the benefits of several brands, even from the same

        company, we find that they are targeted towards different kinds of segments.
               Let us take for example, the company Casio, the company which makes watches. This company
        offers different brands for different segments. The brand Sonata caters to specific segment that requires

        economical  watches  that  will  also  have  a  visual  appeal.  The  brand  Fastrack  caters  to  a  younger  urban
        segment and Xylys is an offering that caters to the premium segment that requires a brand that is comparable
        to a foreign brand.

               By catering to the specific benefits of consumer group with similar characteristics, a brand ensures
        that  it  does  not  compete  with  another  brand  of  the  same  company.  This  is  a  very  important  aspect  of

        segmentation  at  the  organization  level  and  this  is  also  known  as  Cannibalization.  A  brand  should  not
        cannibalize another brand belonging to the same company, and segmentation has to take care of that.
               If we define the process of segmentation, we need to understand that it is dividing the heterogeneous

        market  into  specific  homogeneous  markets  based  on  consumer  characteristics.  It  is  very  important  to
        understand  that  the  market  is  heterogeneous  in  the  sense  that  it  is  all  mixed  up  with  different  kinds  of

        consumers. The markets are mixed up with the diverse preferences, and a homogeneous market is required
        by  a  marketer  to  ensure  that  he  caters  to  consumers  with  similar  characteristics.  The  consumer
        characteristics could be defined based on demographics like age or the stage in the life cycle. It could be

        income. It could be education. It could be a combination of several demographic factors. The factors can also
        be psychological in nature, and that takes into account the way the consumers live and why they buy specific

                                                                                                              14]]></page><page Index="204"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                     Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus

        categories,  products  and  brands.  In  fact,  specific  characteristics  of  consumers  would  depend  on  their
        lifestyles, which means the manner in which they are living in a given context.
               The context of the Asian market is very different from the context of Western markets due to the

        complexities of cultural factors in the country. For example, there could be segmentation based on cultural
        practices. For instance, the brand Mangal Deep from ITC caters to a specific segment of religious consumers
        who are strongly interested in cultural practices. These practices may involve lighting a scented stick/ incense

        stick as a part of the offering during a prayer, and Mangal Deep is one such offering.
               It is to be carefully noted that very rarely segmentation is based on one characteristic or one base
        which is used to divide the segment. Segmentation in a given context may require more than one criterion.

        When we take again the soap market or the mobile market, there is a fragmentation of price bands.
               So possibly, one of the ways to segment the market is to divide the price bands and make a note of

        the  brands  which  compete  in  a  price  band  before  applying  segmentation  with  respect  to  the  other
        characteristics.

             II. SEGMENTATION AND MARKETING MIX ELEMENTS

               The  next  stage  of  segmentation  deals  with  the  importance  of  marketing  mix  elements  on

        segmentation. This is because, for any given segment, there needs to be a marketing mix if the segmentation
        has to be effective. So, selecting the marketing mix, which is very appropriate for the segment is a prerequisite
        for useful segmentation.

               Let us take a look at a few points that are useful to drive the point across. There is a term called stimuli
        in consumer behavior. Stimulus is singular, and stimuli is plural. This is a very important definition because

        conceptually it gives an important idea of how the various aspects of the environment impact our senses.
        Stimuli is any input to any of the sensory organs. For instance, it could be a sense of touch when we visit
        shops or malls to buy things. When we start examining the products which we try to buy, there is a sense of

        touch involved. There is a visual stimuli which is involved when we see with our eyes, and we notice brands
        and product categories with visual appeal. There is a sense of smell by which we are able to sniff out the

        basic aroma associated with the product.
               The five senses form an important aspect of input as far as consumer behavior is concerned and this
        can be probably what is known as sensory branding.





                                                                                                              15]]></page><page Index="205"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                     Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus

               The term sensory branding is associated with the senses. When we consider Singapore Airlines, the
        frequent travelers who travel in this Airline may recall a sense of smell. When I talk about matching the
        marketing mix elements with the needs of a given segment, this would mean -selecting the right product, the

        right price, which offers value in the perception of consumers, the right kind of distribution channels, and the
        right mix of promotion, which may also involve digital ways of promoting a product. Several well-known brands
        are examples to illustrate this point. Nike in footwear and Oreo biscuits in consumables are good examples

        to drive home the point.
               What  becomes  important  is  that  the  consumer  interaction  takes  place  in  the  form  of  three  basic
        factors. The first factor is the stimulus factor which is concerned with either something which is external to

        the individual or internal to the individual. For instance, if the individual is feeling hungry, the stimulus factor
        is coming from within the individual. If it is a product or if it is a brand name, it is a kind of stimuli which is

        extracted from the external world. Hence, this stimulus or stimuli is something which creates an impact on
        the need aspect or the want aspect of the consumer. The consumer interest in buying a television will start
        looking out for stimuli concerned with the television. We can also have stimuli that is recalled from the mind

        or memory and that is the reason why we recall well-known brands when we want to purchase a product.
        Consumer Response

               The second aspect of the consumers’ interaction is concerned with the response with respect to the
        stimuli  that  has  been  perceived  by  the  consumer.  It  should  be  noted  that  the  response  may  not  be  a
        behavioral action like buying a product or buying a brand. It can even be  knowing about the brand and

        developing a favorable attitude towards the brand.
               Besides these two factors, there is something known as the intervening variable. In order to study the
        impact  of  stimulus  and  response  on  the  psyche  of  the  consumers,  we  need  to  have  an  idea  about  the

        intervening variables. The intervening variables are internal to the consumers. It could be motivation. It could
        be consumers’ attitude. It could be about how the consumer has learnt about the stimuli. It could be even
        something  to  do  with  the  personality  of  the  consumer.  Without  the  intervening  variables,  there  is  no

        processing of stimuli and we need to understand that the intervening variables are based on the response of
        the individual.

               For instance, the consumer going to the shopping mall and being convinced about a brand of watch
        and buying it means that he has learnt about the brand of watch. He has developed a favorable attitude in
        terms of the appreciation of the watch. He has used his inner motivation to develop that attitude towards the

        watch and finally he has responded by buying the watch. This is a simple example of how the stimulus
        response works with respect to intervening variables.

               There are number of complexities associated with the intervening variables, they may keep changing.
        Motivations may change with the respect to different kinds of life stages. When one is a student, there is a
        different motivation. When one is an executive, there is all together at different kind of motivation. When one

        becomes a father or mother, the motivation is much different. The product category of energy drinks be
        appealed to a consumer segment that has a favorable attitude when one is young, and it may undergo a

                                                                                                              16]]></page><page Index="206"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                     Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus

        change with respect to attitude when one becomes older. So, these are some of the intricacies associated
        the model of consumer response to the stimulus and the usage of intervening variables.
        Marketing Mix Elements

               We can look at marketing mix elements as a kind of stimulus or stimuli factor because they have an
        important impact on the psyche of the consumer. Marketing mix elements, are the four P’s of marketing. This
        is the classical marketing mix. Several other aspects may have been added to the marketing mix elements,

        but essentially, it is the marketing mix element that provides the differentiation with respect to a particular
        brand.
               What is to be noted is that when there is a stimulus from the respective brand or the company, there

        is also a competitive stimulus from a variety of brands, which are associated with the particular product
        category targeting the same set of consumers.

               A consumer who is interested in buying a brand of premium car like Audi, maybe equally interested
        in brands like Mercedes and BMW. His stimulus factor is not only associated with the specific brand, it is also
        associated with the competitive environment as well.

               To  make  things  simple,  let  us  consider  different  brands  of  the  same  company.  In  the  Philippine
        context, Toyota is a car manufacturing company, and it has different kinds of brands. Hino is one, Lexus as

        one, Ranz is one. So, when we consider the marketing mix of the respective brand like, Hino or Lexus or
        Ranz, we find that the marketing mix elements associated are competing with several other brands in the
        same segment. So, it is essential to appreciate at this stage that the stimulus factors do not only come from

        the marketing mix elements of the respective brand, but also from the offerings of competitive brands.
               Stimulus factors could also come from the cultural environment. For example, the fitness culture is
        catching on, and Sugar Free is a brand that possibly appeals to the younger segment because of its fitness

        association. In this case, there is a cultural trigger associated with the category as well as a brand. Fitness
        and health are segments that have recently emerged in the Indian urban culture, and several brands compete
        in the sphere.

               Finally, segmentation provides a very clear focus for an organization in a cluttered environment. If we
        take the online fashion brand like Zalora, it focuses on a specific segment. The important point to be noted is

        that  the  organization  selects  one  or more  segments,  depending  on  its  strategic  pursuit  of  how  it  should
        approach the market as well as the consumer segments.

              III. TYPES OF BRANDS AND VALUE


        Brand Differentiation
               Now that we have some idea about segmentation, let us cover two more important aspects that are
        concerned with segmentation and brand positioning. The first aspect is about brand differentiation and the

        second aspect is about brand positioning. Let us quickly get an idea about how brands are differentiated.
               With  brand  proliferation,  different  segments  emerge  within  a  category  and  there  is  a  need  to
        differentiate a brand regardless of what it sells in a given context. About 80 years back, because of the lack

        of intense competition, there was little differentiation. The classical concept of unique selling proposition of
        the USP is still applicable as a brand needs to ensure what it sells is differentiated among its competitors.

        The  USP  or  the  Unique  Selling  Proposition  fundamentally  drives  the  brand  differentiation  and  it  was
        advocated by Rosser Reeves during the sixties and after almost 6 decades we find that that USP is still
        relevant today.

               To understand how unique selling proposition works, you need to understand what the different kinds
        of  brands  are.  There  may  be  three  different  kinds  of  brands:  Functional,  Symbolic,  and  Hedonic  or

        Experiential. It is to be noted that for our purposes of understanding, we are trying to understand the brands
        in a compartmentalized manner as Functional or Symbolic or Hedonic. In actual practice, functional, symbolic,
        and hedonic may not be all that exclusive, which means that a functional brand can also convey a symbolic

        benefit or the hedonic benefit. But most successful brands have a dominant aspect related to the kind of
        brand. The dominant aspect could be functional, or it could be symbolic, or it could be hedonic. Hedonic is to
        do with a sensual pleasure.

               Let us consider a few examples. The functional brand is one which provides a solution for a problem
        and the consumer is able to clearly perceive the tangible benefit. For instance, the detergent brand offering
        a stain free performance is a functional benefit. The brand of toothpaste offering fresh breath is a functional

        benefit, a brand like Sensodyne Toothpaste, which offers a solution to sensitivity of teeth is also functional.
        Any brand that offers a solution to a problem or that offers a clear-cut benefit is a functional brand.

               The Fastrack brand shows the time, and it also has a number of features of a watch at the same time,
        the dominant value of this watch is a symbolic benefit. A symbolic benefit can be an emotion. It can be
        prestige. It can be the sense of belongingness or it can be something very psychological in nature. The point

        is, symbolic is internal to the consumer as opposed to the functional benefit that is internal to the product.
        Karatometer is something which will tell the consumer about the genuineness of gold. So, there is a symbolic

        trust of trust associated with the brand Titan that had introduced the meter to check the purity of gold. Forever
        21 is another brand that is into fashion, and it is very symbolic of the state of art fashion as associated with
        the youngsters.

               Several brands of shampoo have a styling factor, and this is also symbolic in nature. Symbolic could
        also be associated with the emotion. The joy of gifting a diamond is very symbolic in nature. The well-known

                                                                                                              19]]></page><page Index="209"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                     Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus

        brand De Beers is a brand of diamond jewelry that is associated with the ritual of gifting during the wedding
        engagement and this signifies warmth and affection with respect to the context.
               Finally,  the  hedonic  factor  is  experiential  in  nature.  When  we  say  experiential,  it  could  be  the

        experience  of  functional  aspect,  or  it  could  be  the  experience  that  is  very  sensual  in  nature.  Hedonism
        specifically means an experience that is sensual in nature. A good example of hedonism is the case of a Red
        bull drink which offers an experience with respect to the parties associated with the youngsters. It offers a

        sensual experience when a consumer drinks it. Starbucks or Cafe Coffee Day in the Indian context also offers
        the sensual experience of visiting a cafe and spending time with friends. It is be noted that even Red Bull,
        which is a hedonic brand, may have a functional benefit of having a high caffeine that keeps an individual

        awake.
               So, these are some of the primary kinds of brands and we need to understand that there is a dominant

        part of the USP which is internal to the consumer, and that is important from the viewpoint of segmentation
        and positioning.
        Value

               By understanding unique selling proposition and the type of brands, we have come to the next aspect
        of defining value. The value in simple terms is a benefit-sacrifice equation. Benefits are associated with what

        the consumer receives, and sacrifices indicate the sacrifices made by the consumer in terms of his money,
        effort, his time and even his psychological energy.
               Value is always defined with respect to a segment, and this is very critical in segmentation. Different

        segments seek different kinds of values from a brand. Value can be of three kinds. It can be functional value
        or symbolic value or hedonic value, as we have already discussed.
               Finally, the marketing mix elements combined with the needs offer a specific value to a segment. For

        example, Apple's iPhone is a product with the number of features. It is available in specific distribution outlets,
        and it creates a unique experience. It is priced as a premium, which indicates a specific value associated
        with this and this value is both symbolic as well as functional. But predominantly, when one looks at iPhone

        despite the presence of functional value, the symbolic association is dominant because the usage of a brand
        of mobile phone would probably indicate something about the prestige associated with the user of a brand.

             IV. TARGETING AND POSITIONING


               There  are  three  important  aspects  in  what  we  call  as  the  segmentation  process.  They  are
        segmentation, targeting, and positioning. Unless the three aspects are covered, the basics of segmentation
        and positioning are incomplete. A company must target specific segments through targeting specific groups

        of consumers. The number of segments which are targeted by a company would depend on its own strategy,
        its resources, and profitability levels.
               There are companies like Cadbury - in the Chocolate Category, for instance, which believed that there

        should  be  something  for  everyone  and  may  have  several  segments  in  place.  There  may  be  a  specific
        company which try to target specific segments. When we take Unilever India, the company has Red Label

        Tea, it has Taj Tea, and it also has Tazaa Tea for the respective segment. There may also be a company
        which  targets  a  very  small  cross  section  of  the  entire  market  known  as  the  niche  market.  The  niche  is
        generally highly profitable. It has got special needs and it demands a premium. For instance, Ferrari cars can

        be considered as marketing themselves to a distinct set of consumers who would prefer the offering. There
        are important aspects that are to be considered when segments are targeted, and these are very strategic

        aspects from the viewpoint of a company.
               Changing environment is one of the important aspects when we take the example of watches for
        children that is introduced by Titan. Environment changes over a period of time and today, we have an

        environment where there can be a watch for kids. Changing environment also produces a number of variants
        in the brand, and that results in targeting different segments. When we consider the fairness cream brand
        Fair and Lovely, it has several variants and they target specific segments. We have an environment where

        the  face  wash  is  extremely  important  in  the  make-up  kit  of  youngsters  and  the  changing  environment
        produces very different kinds of segments in the face wash market.
               The market potential is yet another factor that has a strategic impact on segmentation. The cafe

        market in India is an excellent example of the kind of market potential it offers in the future. The category of
        optical wear in India has tremendous amount of potential for branded wear. Branded wear means that there

        are a number of unbranded offerings in the market and branded wear offers a lot of potential in the optical
        market in the Philippine context.
               Depending on the potential and strategy of the company, specific segments are targeted. This is an

        important aspect because there is always a question of what segments are to be targeted. In practice, it may
        be very difficult to follow a highly theoretical approach, and there may be a need to experiment with respect

        to segmentation, positioning, and targeting with all the primary and secondary data in place. When I say
        experiment, it is not that one should keep on launching products and experiment. The experiment refers to
        the kind of combination and permutations that will be ideal for a company in terms of its resource utilization.

        Brand Positioning
               The important concept of brand positioning which is considered to be the anchor for a brand. This is
        because brand positioning has an impact on the consumer psyche, and the transition from a product to a

        brand happens through brand positioning. There are a number of aspects concerned with brand positioning
        and consumer behavior.
               For instance, the decision made by a brand to use a celebrity is an exercise that may involve brand

        positioning. It should be noted that brand possessing is to do with the mind of the consumer. While there may
        be a number of attributes and characteristics, the manner in which the brand enters the mind of the consumer
        is the essence of brand positioning.

               The concept of brand positioning was pioneered during the early part of the 70s by Ries and Trout.
        This is an important value addition to the conceptual thinking because it provides a mental angle to the brand.

        Brand positioning is with respect to creating a unique image in the mind of the consumer about the brand.
               The Starbucks, for instance, has a unique image in terms of the experiential atmosphere it provides
        for consumers. Colgate over a period of time has established itself with a unique image of a trusted oral care

        brand. Dove which is a soap brand in India has the unique aspect of having a moisturizer in a soap to take
        care  of the  complexion.  Positioning  enables  a brand  to  occupy  a focused  slot  in  the mind  of the  target

        consumers.
               Brand positioning can happen in several ways, and the company has to take into consideration the
        proposition of the brand as well as the context when it tries to position a brand. When we talk about a brand

        in the category of Basmati rice, there are several brands in Basmati rice. And given the culture of entertaining
        guests on special occasions, Basmati rice may be used for special occasions. Domex is a brand associated
        with bathroom cleaners. Domex offers the benefit of a clean bathroom. Surf Excel offers the benefit of a stain

        removal.
               Positioning can also be done by user imagery. User imagery means the typical user of a brand is
        portrayed in the positioning of a brand. An advertisement for a brand of jeans is a good example of how the

        user imagery is portrayed in positioning.
               Lifestyles can also be used to position a brand. Lifestyle essentially means the manner in which a

        consumer  spends  his  time  and  money.  For  example,  a  brand  of  SUV  or  Sports  Utility  Vehicle,  may  be
        positioned as an outdoor activity for a family that wants to get away on a weekend. A brand of coffee may be
        positioned with respect to joyful moments in consumers’ life. The Nescafe is a brand of coffee positioned with

        respect to celebrating special moments or romantic moments. Hence, it is a judicious combination of value
        and positioning growth that decides the effectiveness of brand positioning.

        Brand Positioning and Consumer Behavior
               How is Consumer Behavior connected with brand positioning? There are a variety of ways in which
        consumer behavior can make use of brand positioning. For instance, a brand needs to revitalize and reinforce

        itself over a period of time and this is accomplished by a combination of positioning and consumer behavior.
        Let us consider a few examples.

                                                                                                              22]]></page><page Index="212"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                     Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus

               Raymond fabric from the Indian context is a good example. Raymond during the 80s used to be
        positioned  as  a  premium  brand  of  suiting  for  corporate  executives.  Over  a  period  of  time  with  the
        environmental changes there is a need to reposition the brand and during the 90s, Raymond positioned itself

        as  a fabric for the  complete  man. The complete  man  in this  context  meant  that the man  in  a changing
        environment  will  not  only  be  a  good  professional  but  also  would  be  a  good  family  man  sharing  the
        responsibilities associated with the family.

               Ariel Detergent brand that was introduced in the Philippine context during the late 80s had brought in
        a digital campaign that was captioned share the workload. Share the workload here meant that Ariel was
        advocating that men in the household also share the household chores that were traditionally perceived to

        be  the  responsibility  of  the  housewife. With  women's  empowerment gaining  ground  in  recent times, the
        stereotype of a traditional housewife is fading at least in the urban context in India. Ariel with its campaign

        had brought in a strong sense of women's empowerment associated with the brand. Hence, the positive
        attitude  of  consumers towards  the  brand  is  likely  to  be  strengthened  and  this  is  an  important  aspect of
        consumer behavior.

               Raga was a watch in the Indian context, introduced as an ethnic watch wear exclusively targeting
        ladies and it resembled a jewelry. Over a period of time, that stereotype of modern young lady professional

        underwent a radical change. Raga was repositioned as the watch for the self-reliant and independent lady
        who asserts herself realizing her legitimate rights. There is a story line that was built up to convey the self-
        reliance and independence associated with the watch brand in terms of its user imagery. In this example, the

        personality concepts of Consumer Behavior are associated with brand positioning.
               Cadbury chocolate, the molded version from the Cadbury company was always positioned towards
        kids during the 70s and 80s. During the 90s, Cadbury's positioned the molded version of chocolates to adults

        using the changes that were associated with the cultural practices of celebrating happy moments.
               Let us consider another example, which is of Tide brand, again from the detergent category. Tide was
        a detergent brand that was associated for decades with whiteness. The brand was positioned initially towards

        a specific socio-economic class of consumers. And over a period of time it had not only launched variants, it
        had  also  created  a  link  between  the  brand  benefit  and  the  self-esteem  of  the  consumer.  One  of  its  ad

        campaigns  positioned  its  benefit  associated  with  whiteness  of  clothes  linked  with  the  self-esteem  of the
        protagonist in the ad. The ad emphasizes how the whiteness of clothes created the confidence required for
        a young and successful working professional who is from a humble background in terms of financial standing

        and social prestige. The object of such an ad is to ensure that associations created by the ad gets transferred
        to the brand. This would enable the brand to make a positive impact on the psyche of the consumer.

               The classical approach of segmentation and brand positioning explores the mind of the consumer
        and provides a direction for the brand in a given context.

              V. PSYCHOGRAPHICS


               The process of segmentation, targeting, and positioning will not be complete without a mention of
        psychographics and its impact on positioning. Psychographics is captured by the activities, interests, and
        opinions of the consumer target segment. For instance, when we talk about fashion fabrics, we have different

        kinds of apparel namely formal wear, sportswear, social wear, party wear, and there are many kinds of brands
        in the apparel sector. A typical psychographic analysis of a consumer segment shows what kinds of activities
        are associated strongly with the consumer segment. What kinds of opinions are expressed by the consumer

        segment on a variety of issues and what kinds of interests are pursued by the consumer – forms an important
        role in understanding the psychographics.

               For example, a group of youngsters who are interested in fashion may be highly interested in sports.
        Hence, they  may  be  visiting sports  venues. There may  be  reading  sports magazines,  and  they  may  be
        listening to sports commentary. These aspects are to be considered by the apparel brand when it wants to

        get into the process of segmentation, targeting, and positioning.
               A brand which is formal in nature, for example, a brand like Park Avenue in the Indian apparel sector

        may possibly be interested in exploring the usage of an English news channel as the media channel for its
        advertisements, taking into consideration the brands target segment. It is to be noted that the activities,
        interests, and opinions of the target segment need to be in line with the product category so that the marketeer

        will be able to appreciate how it impacts the product category and the desired positioning of the brand.
               Finally, this basic lesson gives an idea of how segmentation, targeting, and positioning is all about
        and its linkages with consumer behavior. Module does not deal with operational aspects of how segmentation

        and positioning can be accomplished for the brand. Students can refer to the prescribed textbook after going
        through this lecture and attempt the exercises provided for this module. Operational aspects of segmentation
        and positioning of a brand needs to be experienced by every student of consumer behavior.

                   of consumer.



              I. TYPES OF DECISION AND DECISION MAKING


               Decision making is one of the complex areas of human behavior, and we are trying to apply decision
        making to how consumers decide on a host of aspects. Let us look at different kinds of buying decisions. For
        instance, buying a car, purchasing a snack and grabbing an ice cream just by seeing it. The fundamental

        point  which  comes  to  one's  mind  is  -  do  all  these  decisions  involve  the  same  effort  and  involvement?
        Obviously not.
               Consumer  decision  making  can  involve  day-to-day  decisions.  It  can  involve  well  thought-out

        decisions.  It  can  also  involve  impulsive  decisions,  which  are  taken  on  the  spur  of  the  moment.  Why  is
        consumer  decision  making  so  complex?  The  complexity  of  consumer  decisions  can  be  attributed  to  a

        combination  of  aspects.  These  include  the  motivation  of  the  consumer. When  we  say  motivation  of  the
        consumer, it is extremely complex because we are all different kinds of individuals. It could be because of
        the  money  involved.  Here  again,  we  are  talking  about  money  that  is  used  to  buy  essentials  and  the

        discretionary money in which we buy several discretionary aspects and for consumer behavior, discretionary
        buying and discretionary aspects are extremely important. It could be because of the involvement levels of

        consumers. We get involved with respect to the sugar, which we add to our coffee, we also get involved when
                                                                                                              24]]></page><page Index="217"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                     Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus

        we buy a costly apartment. So, the degree of involvement also matters. The manner in which information
        processing occurs also adds on to the complexity.
               There are times when we want to have an exhaustive processing of information. There are times

        when we do not process information at all. So, the combination of aspects is extremely difficult to probably
        decipher completely, but to the extent possible we try to use consumer behavior to analyze these decisions
        of consumers.

        Types of Consumer Decision Making
               Essentially, there can be three kinds of decision making. One is the routine decision-making where
        we talk about routine decisions like reordering milk, mundane breakfast, and the basic essentials. There

        could be intermediary decision-making where we are talking about some kind of information such as in the
        case of trying to get a new snack. There are a number of snacks which a consumer is using on everyday

        basis and suddenly finds a new snacking which is available in the market and they would like to have some
        information about it. The third kind of decision making is all about elaborate decision making where there is
        a tremendous amount of information processing as well as a high degree of involvement. For example, buying

        a car for most people would involve elaborate decision making.
               Let us now consider a basic decision making that involves elaborate decision making. In the Indian

        context, for instance, let us talk about person who is trying to buy a car for the first time. When we talk about
        entry level cars, there is Suzuki’s brand Alto, another car brand Eon and in the recent times Kwid from Renault
        also has entered into that scenario. Now, with respect to elaborate decision making, the individual has some

        kind  of  value  mapped  into  his  internal  thinking.  The  value  could  be  with  respect  to  style,  economy,
        maintenance services and so on. The point to be noted is that while all consumers would want certain basic
        essentials with respect to the car, with respect to comfort, with respect to convenience, with respect to space,

        there is a dominant aspect, which a consumer may probably  want to have in his decision making. This
        dominant aspect is one of those important aspects when he defines a value for himself in terms of what he
        looks in a car.

               When we take these three brands into consideration, the consumer has to decide on one brand. The
        consumer tries to evaluate many of the factors associated with his value choice across these three brands.

        In addition, there is also the marketing communication or the brand communication or the advertisements of
        the brand, which comes into the picture. For example, Kwid has an advertisement where a celebrity endorses
        the brand. Kwid’s advertisement is also all about trying to showcase its features. The whole proposition of

        Kwid is trying to offer as many features as possible with respect to a small car. Kwid also has the imagery of
        an SUV, a sports utility vehicle that is built into a small car. So, with all these aspects, the question is whether

        the consumer will be able to probably get his decisions influenced by the ad. So, this is just to give you an
        idea about how an elaborate decision-making works.
               When we study less intense decision making, this is connected to a consumer searching for a snack

        which is a limited information-based decision making. The routine snacks which are available in the market



                                                                                                              25]]></page><page Index="218"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                     Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus

        are cake, biscuits, ice creams, delicacies like a Samosa, and new age diet-based snacking like Sky flakes
        and Muesli and so on.
               So, in this case, one needs to look at it from the consumers’ viewpoint as well as the marketer’s

        viewpoint. The essential point to be noted is - how should the marketeer create an involvement with respect
        of the snacking. The involvement, of course, is to do with the mindset of the consumer. The involvement is
        nothing but the degree of personal relevance. So here, when we talk about a snack, the degree of personal

        relevance can be with respect to the diet, can be with respect to the benefits of a diet, can be with respect to
        the benefit of the diet not only for health reasons but also for reasons of appearance. When healthy snack is
        being taken, there is always a promise of not only feeling good but looking good as well.

               Thus,  many  of  these  aspects  need  to  be  considered  by  the  marketeer  when  he  develops  a
        communication with respect to positioning their snack; and the snack needs to be positioned against several

        other snacks which are already present in the market. So, the brand positioning has to take into account the
        decision-making process of the individual.
        Degree of Involvement

               In addition to many of these things, there is also an additional complexity of enduring involvement and
        situational involvement. For example, there could be consumers who are probably interested in a snack just

        to reduce their weight and feel good. There are also consumers who in an enduring manner are probably
        involved with respect to diet-snacking. For these kinds of consumers, maintaining the diet is an eternal effort.
        So, the marketeer, when he plans his communication, whether it is advertising or point of purchase posters,

        needs to take into account whether the target segment reflects an enduring involvement or a situational
        involvement.
               Besides these kinds of decision making, there is also something known as impulse buying. When a

        consumer sees an ice cream, sees a probably an attractive apparel for that matter, they may feel like simply
        buying it. So, psychologically, there is some tension created because the brand or the product is seen by the
        consumer and the tension is resolved only when the consumer buys it.

               In this case, this is known as impulsive buying because the consumer just wants to buy the product
        without going much into the consequences of making the buy. So, to start with, these are some kinds of

        aspects which are probably preliminary from the viewpoint of decision making.

             II. CONSUMER DECISION MAKING INFLUENCERS



               Let us take a look at what exactly is consumer decision making and several aspects of consumer
        behavior that has linkages with consumer decision making.
               Consumer decision making consists of mental and physical activities undertaken by consumers to

        acquire consumer products and services to fulfill their needs and wants. Essentially, it has to do with the
        needs which are basic deprivations, and wants or aspirations. When we talk about trying to have water for
        thirst, which is a need, when we want a Coke to drink that is a want.

               Needs  and  wants  are  absolutely  important  aspects  with  regard  to  consumer  behavior  because
        consumer decision making starts only with needs and wants. There is an actual situation and a desired

        situation. Whether it is water, whether it is thirst, whether the shelter or a real estate property, whether it is
        indulgence with respect to our favorite entertainment, everything starts from needs and wants. Everything
        starts from actual situation and desired situation as perceived by the individual consumer. It is to be noted

        that a feeling of discomfort that exists between the actual situation and the desired situation is not imposed
        by an external aspect. When we talk about advertisements, they do influence the individual, but the actual

        discomfort is generated within the individual. This is an important part as well as the decision-making aspects
        are concerned.
               The next aspect of the definition is with respect to mental and physical activities. When consumers

        start thinking about the Nike shoe which they want to buy, or when the consumers starts thinking about the
        state-of-the-art technological mobile phone they want to buy, consumer decision making starts. Just thinking
        about the product, thinking about the brand, thinking about the stimuli triggers up the mental stimulation, and

        that is precisely what the environment does. So, some part of the stimulation is responsible because of the
        external  forces  and  some  part  of  the  stimulation  comes  from  within.  So,  the  stimulation  created  by  the
        environment and the stimulation experienced by the individual results in the consumer showing interest in

        the brand, acquiring the brand, using the brand, and disposing of the brand and buying a new brand or a new
        product category. Consumer decision making is dynamic in nature.

               So, other than the mental activity, there is a physical activity as well. The consumer browses through
        the internet. The consumer goes to the mall, consumer goes to the shop, the consumer examines the product,
        the consumer reads the label of the brand. The consumer tries to buy the brand or the product. So, that's the

        physical activity which is involved with respect to consumer decision making. So, quickly trying to make a
        note of a consumer decision making, this involves a physical activity, this involves mental activities, this

        involves a stimulation from the environment, this involves stimulation from within, and this is also involves
        discomfort  experience  with  respect  to  the  actual  situation  and  the  desired  situation.  Many  aspects  are
        responsible for the consumer trying to show interest to a decision making eventually trying to decide on the

        decision he or she makes.


                                                                                                              27]]></page><page Index="220"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY

        Consumer Decision Making Influencers
               Let us take a look at the other aspects of decision making. There are decisions on what to acquire
        and when to acquire; how to consume it; how to acquire; how often to acquire; where to acquire; where to

        consume; and how to dispose of the product because disposal is also an important aspect in both from the
        environmental viewpoint as well as from generating value based on the old product from the viewpoint of the
        consumer. So, when we talk about different kinds of decisions associated with the consumer in terms of

        acquisition, consumption, the manner of acquisition, the place where it is acquired, and the disposal aspects
        of consumer decision-making. There are many insights which come into the picture.
               Let us consider a consumer trying to buy a premium watch. Premium watch like Omega or Rolex or

        any such brand. The first aspect to be noted is- how does the consumer experience the motivation to buy the
        watch? Is he/she inspired probably to have a reward for his/her own efforts of accomplishment or is he/she

        inspired to impress his/her friends because a number of them hold a brand in high esteem or is he/she
        inspired by both these aspects? This fundamentally forms a motivation to buy the Rolex watch.
               The other related question is when does he/she want to buy it? Does he/she want to buy it when

        he/she gets into the first job? Does he/she want to buy it when he/she gets a promotion? Does he/she want
        to buy it when he/she gets married? Does he/she want to buy it to celebrate a special occasion? There are

        many possibilities and the marketeer will have to probably get into this possibilities.
               The other aspect is where the customer wants to buy the watch. Does he/she want to visit a retailer
        who is located in a Bazaar or does he/she want to go to a shopping mall and experience the showroom

        effects when buying the brand? Would he/she want to accompany a friend to buy the brand or would he want
        to go alone to buy the brand?
               The next associated aspect is where does the money going to come from for the buy? Is he/she going

        to save the money? Is he/she going to buy it on installment? Is he/she going to wait until the time he/she
        uses his/her discretionary money to buy a premium watch? Does he/she expect somebody else or does
        he/she expect the watch as a gift? So, these are many, many aspects that are concerned with the consumer.

        This is a hypothetical example. For example, when they take the example of a Casio brand, it came into the
        Filipino picture positioning itself as a gift. And people belonging to several segments, possibly thought of a

        Casio when they wanted to gift something to someone else.
               The other aspect to be noted is that services involve consumer decision making just as products do.
        For example, a consumer taking a vacation. So, does he really look into the website? Does he/she look into

        the  word  of  mouth  on  the  web?  Does  he/she  look  into  the  word  of  mouth  with  respect  to  his  friend's
        experiences? What is he going to do with respect to his travel? With respect to his accommodation? Is he/she

        going to look into the shared accommodation aspects? Is he/she going to look into the new internet-based
        models of booking accommodation? So, there are many other aspects which are included when we talk about
        decision making associated with services.

             III. ROLE OF CULTURE IN DECISION MAKING


               Let us quickly take a look at how the cultural backdrop affects the decision making in a context like
        Philippines. We have brands like McDonald, and Omega. These are Western brands and they stand for
        specific brand propositions. For example, McDonald is always about the group experience that is to do with

        enjoying the meal with friends.
               Furthermore, McDonald is all about the values associated with a quick meal, inexpensive meal, clean
        meal, and so on. This is the proposition all over the world. When we talk about again something like a

        Mercedes as a brand, Mercedes stands for prestige and even in the Indian context, Mercedes is bought for
        a symbolic appeal. These are one set of brands.

               Let us take the other set of brands that clearly tells us how the ethnic aspects of decision making is
        slightly different. For example, when we take a brand like Kellogg's, they entered into the Indian context
        during the mid-90s and at a later point in time, they started advertising the Kellogg Cornflakes with hot milk.

        Kellogg  Cornflakes  is  always  taken  with  cold  milk  in  several  other  parts  of  the  world.  It  is  the  symbolic
        significance of warm milk in the Indian context that prompted Kellogg’s to introduce cornflakes with warm

        milk.
               Let us also consider a hair cream Aftershower. Aftershower is an interesting example of how a hair
        cream after almost five decades of existence has assumed importance with respect to the grooming ritual of

        the consumer. Aftershower, as a name implies, is to be applied after the shower, and that was introduced at
        a time when fashion hair gel, hair cream, where all connected with consumer segments involving youngsters.
               Let us also study the case of hair oil Parachute Jasmine. The Jasmine is a flower in the Indian context,

        which  in  several  parts  of  the  country  is  being  used  for  decorating  the  hair.  Jasmine  has  a  very  unique
        fragrance  that  is  associated  with  the  ethnic  aspects  of  decorating  the  hair  using  Jasmine  for  religious
        purposes and there are several other aspects of Jasmine in the consumer's mind. So, Parachute Jasmine

        was a hair oil that was positioned towards the respective consumer segment.
               There are several other examples of how to take into account the cultural aspects before entering into

        the decision-making domain of the consumer. So, culture is something that needs to be dovetailed into the
        marketing program when consumer decision making is considered.
        Rational and Irrational Decisions

               There are rational and irrational decisions. Rational means that it is not completely rational from the
        economic choice viewpoint. It only means that consumers are trained to apply the reason when coming out

        with  a  decision-making  as  we  had  examined  the  elaborate  decision-making  sometime  back.  “Irrational”
        emphasize  within  quotes  because  it  is  just  not  irrational,  it  is  more  of  an  emotional  decision  where  the
        consumer is not given in for rational arguments.

               So, the power of emotion can be find in a variety of contexts wherever consumer choices being made.
        Emotion has become extremely important in today's context where the consumer across a host of categories

                                                                                                              30]]></page><page Index="223"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                     Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus

        decide on the brand, not just on rational decision making but also with respect to emotions that go along with
        rational decision making.
               A very interesting example is the case of the brand Zumba where millions of consumers all over the

        world celebrate their fitness program with Zumba dance. Zumba originated from one of the South American
        countries and one of the founders of Zumba wanted to have a very appealing caption which said, "Ditch the
        Workout, Join the Party". One can see the emotional element with respect to a dance that had a several

        rational benefits associated with health and fitness. So, there is a global example to show how the power of
        emotion can appeal. In the earlier case, we had a discussion on the experiential utility with respect to decision-
        making, where the pleasurable aspects of a brand, in that case a brand of wine was happening even without

        the consumer fully not being aware that he is experiencing the effects of wine. In this case, it is a conspicuous
        emotion that has appeal to millions of people all over the world. So, there are a number of categories in the

        Philippine context that use emotions such as shampoos, chocolates, soaps, cosmetics and the category goes
        on and on.
               There is another interesting aspect that is to do with Automatic Information Processing. This is an

        extremely  interesting  aspect  because  consumers  may  process  information  automatically  without  their
        complete knowledge and at the same time, the automatic processing has an impact on their feelings, goals,

        and behaviors. That is the concept of Adaptive Unconscious which means that the consumer can use the
        automatic processing system to create an automatic set of behaviors concerned with a routine matters. From
        a non-marketing context, if this is to be understood, driving a car is an example. Once a consumer learns

        how to drive a car, he/she does not put all his/her attention for several years unless there is a deviation on
        the road. It is just an automatic process that takes over the driving. So similarly, even in consumer behavior
        automatic processing happens with respect to our habitual behaviors towards the basic essentially as like

        bread,  butter,  and  several  other  choices  like  detergent  powders,  and  etc.,  unless  the  consumer  is  fully
        convinced consciously to change. The whole idea of automatic choices is to ensure that the brain makes use
        of resources towards important things leaving the mundane aspects to automatic decision-making.

             IV. ROLE OF EMOTIONS IN DECISION MAKING



               Let us make a reference to the various models of decision-making in textbooks. These models are
        extremely useful in terms of explaining decision-making, but a student of consumer behavior will be able to
        have a comprehensive view of decision-making if he or she takes into account a number of other factors

        other than the basic models in the textbooks.
               For example, there is a model which are runs from decision-making to post purchase evaluation. The
        model is sequential in nature. This model is extremely useful, and this can be found in almost every textbook

        on consumer behavior. In order to enhance the value of the model, there are number of other factors to be
        considered.

        Motivation and Emotion
               Motivation of the consumers is something extremely important. Motivation is the actionable part of the
        consumer, which propels the consumers into action. Without specific motivation or without the direction of

        the motivation, a consumer will not be able to focus his efforts. The need and want aspect, which we have
        discussed  sometime  back  is  extremely  important  because  from  the  viewpoint  of  motivation  a  need  is

        something that needs to be rectified as it goes down. For example, when our car breaks down, it goes away
        from the need level and the car needs to be repaired. When our energy goes down, we have to consume a
        snack to ensure that the level of energy comes back to that of the original need level.

               What is an aspect which is shaped by individual aspects of personality, lifestyle aspects and a specific
        culture in which the individual lives? The aspect of involvement is interesting because it offers a  synergy
        between motivation, need, and want aspects, and eventually the manner in which the consumer gets involved

        with respect to the product category or the brand.
               Concept of involvement can be divided into high involvement and low involvement. Involvement is the
        degree of personal relevance associated with a particular consumer's perception. There are essentially a

        number of aspects which differentiate low involvement with high involvement. For example, in the case of low
        involvement,  which  is  associated  with  buying  a  battery,  for  example,  the  consumer  is  interested  in  a

        satisfactory performance. The consumer would not worry about the prestige appeal of the battery. This is
        with respect to most of the consumers, the consumer would not probably have an active interest with respect
        to sources of information concerned with the battery. He/she would only reflect passive learning in terms of

        absorbing information about the battery from the environmental sources.
               So, the challenge for the marketer is how does he/she raise the involvement levels with respect to

        low involvement mindset products. So, low involvement is characterized by a specific kind of approach from
        the consumer's end. For example, a consumer who's interested in a soft drink may exist, may reflect a low
        involvement. He/she may first buy the product, experience the product, and then develop an attitude whereas,

        in the case of high involvement, the consumer goes through a number of sources, develops an attitude, and
        then makes a final buy as in the case of a car.

                                                                                                              33]]></page><page Index="226"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                     Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus

               Let us use an example to show how emotion can raise the involvement with respect to an offering.
        Let us consider, for example, a celebrity-based brand. Something like Boost. Boost is a milk additive in the
        Indian context. The milk additive is an offering, which when added to milk, provides the taste, provides a few

        nutrients, and makes milk that much more appealing as compared to plain milk. Boost for the last three
        decades has been used celebrities with the caption "Boost is the secret of our energy". When we say our
        energy, it is a celebrity along with a consumer who's portrayed in the ad.

               The boost advertisements initially started with celebrities, specifically sports celebrities drawn from
        the sports domain who said, "Boost is the success of my energy". And today, the topical celebrity says, "Boost
        is the secret of our energy", along with the consumer. When I say topical celebrities, the brand involves the

        celebrity who is actively successful at a particular period in time.
               Let us consider how the involvement levels are raised with respect to this additive called Boost, which

        is a brand. It is a well-known brand.
               There is the concept of Excitation of Transfer Theory, which means when consumers experience an
        involvement with regard to one stimuli, they transfer the same involvement and emotion to another stimuli.

        We have already seen that stimuli is input to any of the sensory organs. So, celebrity is a stimuli, when
        consumers get involved and get emotional with respect to the celebrity, the consumer who essentially is a

        kid who drinks the drink Boost transfers his emotion on to the brand Boost. This is one aspect of involvement
        being raised. The other aspect of involvement is with respect to the motivation and emotion. It has to be noted
        this is a very powerful combination.

               The motivation is the internal drive from that consumer with respect to his involvement and motivation
        propels the consumer into action. Action of searching for a brand and buying a brand. The emotion is the
        feeling, which is also backed up with something known as arousal, and arousal is the state of wakefulness.

        When we say somebody has been aroused, he/she is in the state vaguefulness, she/he's alert.
               So, motivation along with emotion provides a powerful focus for the consumer. So, the emotional
        involvement, the respect to the celebrity and the emotion being transferred on from the celebrity to the brand

        works with the motivation of the individual. To produce enduring involvement as far as the Boost is concerned,
        because the target segment of kids, show an enduring involvement with regard to a sport. Generally, we find

        that consumers as kids who are interested in a particular sport, follow the sport even when they become older
        and that's why I call it as an enduring involvement in this context.

              V. SOCIAL JUDGMENT THEORY



               In order to take decision-making to a deeper level, let us get into one of the theories in our final phase
        of this lesson on decision-making.
               There  may  be  a  number  of  theories  associated  with  decision-making.  One  such  theory  is  social

        judgment theory. To reemphasize, several of these theories enable us to better understand the theoretical
        models  which  are  presented  in  books.  Social  judgment  theory  was  developed  by  Sheriff.  The  theory  is
        extremely useful in terms of conceptualization of the need of the consumer. As I've already mentioned earlier,

        the need want is a very important stage and this theory probably provides a perspective to understand that
        need want aspect in a better manner.

               The basic assumption in this theory is that an individual's position with respect to a belief is based on
        his involvement with respect to an issue. The individual takes a position with respect to his thinking based on
        his involvement on a specific issue. In the domain of consumer behavior, we can consider several aspects

        across  brands  and  possibly  extend  social  judgment  theory  into  the  decision-making  area  of  consumer
        behavior.

               In this example, there is the proposition of facial wash for men. As we have seen in recent times in
        the Filipino context, male grooming is an important part of a man's ritual of grooming. We find creams for
        men. Hair oil for men and several other cosmetic aspects that were the exclusive preserve of women in the

        previous year’s slowly getting opened up for men. We have a couple of brands in the area of facial wash.
        One is Ponds form men and women which is strongly entrenched in the Filipino context. The brand entered
        the Filipino context by its offering for women, and today it has a variant for men.

               Let us take a look at how the category of facial wash for men could be associated with social judgment
        theory.  According to  the  theory,  there's  a  zone  of  acceptance. The  zone  of  acceptance  means  that the
        individual accepts the idea with a high degree of involvement. There is also a zone of rejection where the

        individual rejects a specific idea. It could be a proposition of the brand. It could be philosophy associated with
        the religion and so on and so forth. There is also a zone of non-commitment, which is associated with the

        individual. Of course, there could be several other kinds of variations with respect to the zone of acceptance
        and rejection in shades and degrees. In order to have a good idea about the concept of social judgment
        theory,  as  applied  to  decision-making.  Let  us  consider  the  statement  facial  wash  for  men  is  useful.  An

        individual who believes strongly that facial wash for men is useful belongs to the zone of acceptance and an
        individual who believes that a fairness cream for men is useless, belongs to the zone of rejection.

        Experiential Utility
               Professor Baba Shiv, the well-known researcher, had brought in an insight that will have profound
        implications  on  consumer  decision-making.  That  was  a  time  when  price  leadership  was  getting  popular

        among marketers. Price leadership made that if a brand brings down its price, it can slowly build leadership
        with respect to its domain.

                                                                                                              35]]></page><page Index="228"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                     Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus

               This researcher was curious to know the effectiveness of such an approach because there is a very
        strong connection between price and quality. When consumers perceive price to be on the lower side, they
        would also perceive quality to be that much lower. When Baba Shiv asked marketeers they just told him that

        there would certainly be an impact with respect to the perception of prices among consumers, but that would
        slowly get adjusted as consumers started using the product. In other words, the expected utility from the
        transaction would not have any implications on the experiential utility.

               Researcher, Baba Shiv came out with a very interesting experiment. This is an experiment where
        respondents had to taste different kinds of wines, which were ranging from $5 to $90. Each respondent was
        randomly shown different kinds of prices with respect to the wine, and the respective wine was injected into

        his mouth with a specific mechanism. The responded would be given the wine after the prices were flashed
        so that he could see that. The respondent would have the wine in his mouth for some time and at a later point

        in time, the mouth would be washed off, and again, another type of wine which had a different price tag would
        be fed into the mouth of the respondent. Each respondent was monitored through an MRI scan. This meant
        that the brain waves could be observed as and when the respondent was tasting the wine. It is so turned out

        that the portions of the brain, which were to do with pleasure was flashing more whenever the respondent
        experienced a wine which was priced higher. So, this meant that when the respondent had tasted a wine

        costing $90, those parts of the brains which was associated with the pleasurable zones were flashing much
        more than when it flashed when the respondent was experiencing a wine, which was priced lower.
               The interesting fact is that all the wines tasted by each of the respondents were the one and the same.

        This clearly brought out the fact that the experiential aspect with respect to the wine had profound impact
        with respect to the pleasure perceived by that respondent.

               3. Explain the importance of sensation and attention in sensory building.

               4. Identify the causes on how a brand increase the product price in such a secretive way.
               5. Discuss the difference between intrinsic and extrinsic attributes and their implications on

                 perception.




              I. PERCEPTION AND BRANDING


               The inherent aspect of perception is a unique aspect of the individual's world. So, the unique aspect
        of the individual world is something which is associated with the private world of an individual. And perception
        forms the basic input with respect to branding. In fact, we can say that perception anchors branding and what

        makes it special is that perception is selective. This means that if an individual is interested in buying a TV,
        he would look for ads and information only associated with TV or television. If a person, if an individual is

        interested in a magazine, he's going to stay focused and be selective in his perception while he's reading the
        magazine. So, perception is highly selective, and that is the reason the individual is able to probably select
        his stimuli that is of importance to his motivation and needs. Can we imagine a world where an individual is

        bombarded by millions of stimuli and he does not have a selective mechanism? In fact, the selectivity of
        perception provides the focus to the perceptual thoughts of the individual. Without selectivity, the individual

        would find it extremely difficult to perceive anything in this world, and hence form a thought process.






                                                                                                              35]]></page><page Index="231"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                     Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus

               Branding again is a challenge to the marketer because the marketer has to create a unique image
        not only in terms of an individual's mind but in terms of all individuals who are a part of the target segment of
        the brand. Let us take the example of a brand like a Dove soap. So essentially, the core proposition of Dove

        soap is that it contains a high degree of moisturizer. When Dove started advertising itself, it was very clear
        about what kinds of perception it will induce in the mind of the consumer. Unique Selling Proposition of Dove
        clearly brought out the fact the soap has moisturizer and despite the fact that it competes with soaps in the

        soap category, it'll have a unique perception that this is a soap with a significant amount of moisturizer which
        is good for the skin. That gives us an idea about how perception needs to appeal not just to the individual,
        but  to  the  target  segment  of  a  particular  brand  when  a  brand  positions  itself  to  the  relevant  consumer

        segments.
               So, the challenge is to ensure that the personal reality, which is created at the individual, amidst the

        target  segment  is  also equally  felt  with  respect  to  several  individuals  in  the  target  segment. That  is  the
        fundamental challenge with respect to the usage of perception by the marketer.

              II. PERCEPTION AND CULTURE


               Perception also has a cultural aspect to it. Any perception has to take place in the atmosphere of
        culture, in the backdrop of a culture, in the context of a culture and hence cultural symbolism is an important

        aspect of perception.
               Cultural  symbolism  involves  how  a  stimuli  associated  with  certain  symbolic  characteristics  in  the
        culture is used by the marketer. When we talk about the symbolic characteristics with respect to certain

        ingredients  associated  bathing  in  the  Indian  context,  it  could  be  Neem,  it  could  be  Saffron,  it  could  be
        Sandalwood, we see that the Sandalwood, Saffron, and Neem have very specific cultural symbolism, which

        is associated with the beauty aspect of an individual. Hence, we have a number of brands trying to make use
        of the natural ingredients associated with these ingredients when the soap is being positioned.
               Today, there is a back-to-the-nature tendency on the part of consumers in the environment, and we

        see a number of brands associating themselves with the Ayurvedic aspects of functioning when it comes to
        the benefits associated with the specific brand used for a specific purpose. So hence, cultural symbolism

        makes an important aspect of perception.
               When it comes to cultural symbolism that is a symbolism that matters to the respective target segment.
        There could be something like Saffron and Neem, as I had mentioned earlier, that has a mass appeal and

        there could be something like a Fastrack watch from Titan that may not have a mass appeal, but that may
        appeal to a specific target segment based on certain symbolic characteristics that are relevant to that culture.

                                                                                                              36]]></page><page Index="232"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                     Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus

        This could be with respect to the feeling of youth, this could be with respect to the feeling of being trendy, this
        could be with respect to the feeling associated with the rebellious attitude in a culture. Many of these things
        possibly may be associated with the brand Fastrack from Titan.

               So, the marketer needs to be careful to ensure that the cultural symbolism that is associated with the
        brand is relevant to that target segment.
        Influence of Native Country and Culture

               With  respect  to  perception,  let  us  consider  an  excellent  example  of  how  the  country  of  origin  is
        associated  with  the  cultural  context.  The  distinguishing  feature  of  this  example  is  that  this  is  not  even
        associated with a specific consumer marketing strategies.

               This example was given by one of the pioneers of a positioning strategy in a brand summit during the
        year 2006. The backdrop is set in the country of Argentina. The challenge was to market a brand that was at

        the cutting edge of laser technology with respect to bar-coders. How old the brand, which was called as multi-
        scan market itself with the country of origin as Argentina, despite the fact that it was a good product with the
        state-of-the-art technology. This is the challenge.

               In an unbelievable manner, the perceptual field of buyers was changed in the following manner:
               The owner's name was Roberto, hinting at a non-American origin. This was changed as Robert. The

        brand moved its headquarters from Argentina to Florida to become an American brand. These two moves
        ensured that the brand met with a huge success in terms of its export and in terms of its sales within a short
        period of the change. This gives us an idea about the power of perception especially in the backdrop of a

        cultural context and how the change of context had mattered to the target segment of this particular brand.

             III. SENSATION AND ATTENTION


               Moving onto some of the important aspects of perception, there are two aspects which are important:
        sensation and attention.

               Sensation occurs when a stimuli comes within the grasp of sensory organs. The stimuli could be a
        brand, or the stimuli could be a visual image, or the stimuli could be a food product, or the stimuli could be a
        sound. So essentially, when a stimuli is within the grasp of a sensory organ it can be with respect to the grasp

        of ice within the vicinity of the audible range something which an individual can taste, something which an
        individual can touch. So, the point at which it enters the vicinity of a sensory organ sensation takes place.

        Sensation is perhaps the fundamental aspect of sensory branding. Without sensation, there cannot be any
        sensory input and without any sensory input a perception cannot take place.
               The  next  aspect  is  attention.  Attention  occurs when  a  stimuli  is  noticed.  As  you might  or  rightly

        guessed, attention could be voluntary, or attention can be involuntary. A loud sound in a silent room is an
        example  of  an  involuntary  attention-getting  stimuli.  We  have  all  noticed  that  sometimes  the  volume  of

        television can go up when a specific ad comes on the screen. This actually is involuntary attention. It is very
        important to understand that whenever a consumer is interested in some things, selective attention takes
        place and attention to advertisements, attention to product details are voluntary. When the consumer is not

        interested in any specific category or in any specific brand or in any specific marketing aspect, he can still
        probably be attending to several kinds of stimuli generated by marketing. For instance, one may not be
        interested in buying a car at some point in time and still can be probably attend to an ad because of its

        involuntary nature and because of certain kinds of interest level of the individual himself. So, the involvement
        with respect to interest can be situational or it can be enduring. So, which means someone who's interested
        in cars as a general matter of interest can still keep attending to the ads of cars even when he's not purchasing

        a car.

        Impact of Senses on Perception
               The next important aspect is the impact of specific senses with respect to perception. Specific senses

        include sight, sound, smell, touch, and taste. The sensory aspect of branding, as I had stated earlier, starts
        off with sensory aspects. The senses also form an input, and hence an important aspect from the viewpoint

        of branding.
               Let us take for example, sight. Let us take a very common-place example of consumers shopping for
        apparel- a specific colors and vibrant colors probably attract consumers that is with respect to seeing. The

        visual appeal of our product itself can be associated with sight. Let us take the example of a pressure cooker.
        Let us take the example of a mobile. Let us even consider a product like Apple's iPhone, all of them have

        specific features that should appeal to that sense of sight.




                                                                                                              39]]></page><page Index="235"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY

               When we talk about the sound, we find that very specifically the Indian context consumers prefer
        sounds which are quite loud in its nature. Loud sound is a part of the Indian culture. From the viewpoint of
        branding, sound is extremely important. When we take the example of Titan, Titan has developed a very

        specific, background music that is consistently associated with the brand. It is a western classical music piece
        by Mozart. For several decades, Titan has been using it.
               Smell is an important aspect. Smell can be associated with the aroma of food. It can be associated

        with the fragrance from a perfume. It can be associated even with respect to or the kind of smell one gets
        when he buys a bathroom cleaner. In the Indian context, it is very common to find consumers choosing a
        brand of bathroom cleaner that has a very strong smell. The basic assumption is that the stronger the smell

        the more would be its effectiveness with the respect to the germs.
               In the Filipino context whether we buy jewelry or whether we buy an apparel, whether we buy a car,

        or whether we buy real estate, it is all by the sense of touch. This is just not a cultural aspect associated with
        the  Indian  context.  It  can  be  associated  with  any  context.  How  does  touch  experience  perception  is  a
        important aspect? For example, when we find that a very specific mobile brand has a special design, we

        would like to touch and feel the design and that has an impact on our perception of the brand. So, touch is
        extremely important aspect from the viewpoint of branding.

               Taste is yet another dimension of sensory branding. When we take biscuits like Britannia 50-50, we
        find there's is a blend of different tastes. So, tastes are associated with several kinds of perceptions. When
        we talk about an energy drink, consumers perceive a particular taste. When we talk about a soft drink, which

        is not connected with an energy drink, there is this very specific aspect of perception regarding their taste.
        When we talk about a multinational, like a Nestle introducing Curd into the Indian context, consumers would
        like to know whether the taste is almost on par with the cultural aspect of tastes connected with Curd. When

        a brand of coffee wants to offer instant coffee, the consumers are eager to know whether the taste of coffee
        is associated with the kind of cultural taste of coffee they've been associated for the last several decades.
        For example, if it is South India, consumers prefer filter coffee. Thus, a brand of coffee marketed in South

        India should it have a taste which is very close to filter coffee.
               The point to be noted is that the consumer has a multisensory experience. It is just not one aspect

        and when the consumer buys a brand of biscuit there's a sense of taste, there's a sense of smell, there's a
        sense of a visual appreciation of the package, there's a sense of touch when the consumer just about touches
        the biscuit, making it a multisensory experience. It is for the brand to achieve a competitive edge on its

        proposition with respect to a sense of branding that is associated with a particular brand. So essentially, it is
        the context that decides on how our brand should respond to the challenges of multisensory aspects affecting

        consumers.
               There  are  several  examples  with  respect  to  how  taste  affects  the  perception  of  consumers.  For
        example, today we have health and fitness as a trend. “Anything which is healthy is not tasty” can be a

        perception which is widely spread among the consumers of the Indian context. How should a marketer of a
        healthy brand attend to this kind of perception is a challenge. Similarly, when “anything which is indulgent

                                                                                                              40]]></page><page Index="236"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY

        and tasty, is not healthy” is a perception, how should a brand, which is into indulgence ensure that the
        unhealthy aspect of the brand does not really mask the perception of a brand? Today, we find a number of
        brands in the health sphere associating themselves with more of baked foods rather than fried foods in an

        attempt to cater to snacking and health where there could be a compromise within taste and health.

              IV. APPLICATION OF PERCEPTION


        Just Noticeable Difference
               This lesson will also discuss certain things which are associated with certain interesting applications

        of perception. Absolute threshold is the point at which a person can experience a sensation. It is extremely
        interesting because it has a practical significance in a country like India. We see several hoardings on the

        board when we are in a busy street in any of the metropolitan cities or even in towns, we see a number of
        hoardings with advertisements. What is the point at which a person can experience a sensation when he
        sees a hoarding that has an ad - has interesting implications on the noticeability and attention given to that

        particular hoarding.
               Just Noticeable Difference or JND is the difference between two stimuli and it is based on the
        relative intensity of first stimulus. JND was advocated by a scientist known as Weber and JND and Weber's

        laws have very interesting applications in marketing. Let me first explain what is JND. For example, let us
        take money as a stimuli. If money is a stimuli, let us examine the category of grocery and the category of
        cars. A car, which is priced at four lakhs wants to raise the prices by about a hundred rupees. This will not

        be a just noticeable difference because the initial stimuli of four lakhs is significantly larger than the raise
        which is noticed. Let us take the case of a consumer shopping for grocery. Let us assume that the consumer

        is shopping for about a hundred rupees and the shopkeeper gives him a discount of two rupees. The two-
        rupee discount will be noticed by the consumer whey they shopping for a hundred rupees because two rupees
        is still a significant aspect of a hundred rupees in the category of shopping for groceries.

               Essentially, the initial stimulus and the final stimulus in both the cases, it is the initial price and the
        modified price with the discounting in the case of grocery, or in the case of raise of prices in the case of car

        is the initial stimulus and the modified stimulus. So higher the initial stimulus higher is the change required in
        the same stimulus for the consumers to notice it. A two rupees increase in grocery will be noticed, but a 200
        rupees raise with respect to the price of a car may not get noticed and that is the implication as far as just

        noticeable difference is concerned.



                                                                                                              41]]></page><page Index="237"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                     Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus

               The interesting aspect of just noticeable difference is that when a brand of chocolate, when a brand
        of detergent, when a brand of coffee, when a brand of grocery wants to reduce the quantity because of price
        rises, the reduction in quantity should not be perceived by the consumer. For example, a brand of detergent

        today, probably sells its weight as 245 grams for a particular price. A couple of years back, the pack was 250
        grams. Now, the reduction of five grams has been accommodated to ensure that there is no price change.
        There is no price change when the brand switched over its packaging from 250 grams to 245 grams. In this

        case, the change with respect to the grammage, which is 5 grams may not be perceived by the consumer.
        This is a typical example of how the marketer is able to adjust the grammage with the references to the price
        increases ingredients without altering the final price of the brand.

               The flip side of the implication with respect to new product development is equally interesting. A
        chocolate  which  wants  to  reposition  and  relaunch  itself  as  milk-based  chocolate  should  ensure  that  the

        relaunched  chocolate  will  be  perceived  as  milk-based  chocolate.  In  this  case,  the  milk-based  chocolate
        should be reflected in the sense of taste. So, as we can infer there are changes that the marketer would not
        want the consumers to perceive and there are changes where the marketer would want the consumers to

        perceive  in  the  context  of  repositioning  and  in  the  context  of  revitalization  and  so  on  and  so  forth.  The
        noticeability associated with the change in the stimulus is quite difficult and complex from the consumer's

        viewpoint as well as for conveying the changes from the marketer's viewpoint. This is known as JND and its
        applications with respect to perceptual aspects of a brand.
        Implications of JND

               Major implications of JND can be seen with respect to management of a product line. In today's
        context, product line is an important aspect of branding. A product line consists of several kinds of offerings
        from the same brand with respect to different types of target segment. For instance, when we take the product

        line of Tea, there can be Taj Mahal catering to one segment, there can be Red Label Three Roses catering
        to another segment, there can be Taajaa Tea catering to a different segment. All the three brands are from
        the same company, Unilever. And the challenge is to ensure they get differentiated with respect to several of

        the marketing mix elements from the viewpoint of the target segment. Some interesting examples can be
        discussed as far as the product line management and JND are concerned.

               Let us take for example a brand from the detergent sector. Surf Excel is a brand. Surf Excel has a bar
        soap as well as a powder detergent offering. So, powder detergent is a different product form as compared
        to the bar soap. Now the challenge for a Surf Excel brand is to ensure that both the powdered form of Surf

        Excel as well as the bar form of Surf Excel appropriately marketed to that target segment with respect to the
        ads, with respect to the unique selling proposition, with respect to several aspects of the two offerings in the

        product line.
               Parachute Hair Oil is a very popular brand in the Indian context, and they have a host of offerings with
        respect to their product line. There is an offering called Parachute Jasmine which is associated with the

        Jasmine fragrance that's popular in several parts of the country. That is basic of Parachute Coconut Oil which
        talks about the goodness of the coconut oil and there are other variants of Parachute oil that are concerned

                                                                                                              42]]></page><page Index="238"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY

        with the herbal offerings, whether it is a hair oil or whether it is watches, or whether it is apparel, it is extremely
        important for marketers to ensure that there are very specific differences between several aspects of the
        product line, which are marketed to different kinds of consumer groups or target segments.

               In  certain  categories,  it  becomes  extremely  complex  and  difficult  for  the  brand  to  achieve  the
        differentiation which we are talking about in the context of JND. For instance, let us take the case of the
        mobile category in the Indian context. When we take Samsung mobile, when we take on another brand of

        mobile, there are extensive price points. The price points are very tightly provided in the product line and
        each product offering is concerned with the price point. The challenge for the marketer is to ensure that
        consumers differentiate across these price points and the challenge doesn't end there. That marketer has to

        also ensure that the product line as a whole results in profitability.
               So, consumer perception which is shaped by JND is responsible for differentiation. And eventually, it

        is also responsible on how well the marketer is able to make use of it with respect to the profitability associated
        with the brand. Product line management is one of the most useful applications of perception very specifically,
        the just noticeable different aspects of perception.

              V. ATTRIBUTES OF PERCEPTION


        Intrinsic and Extrinsic Attributes
               The lesson will discuss the difference between intrinsic and extrinsic attributes and their implications
        on perception.

               Intrinsic attributes are those that are inherent in the product or brand itself. For example, the color of
        a brand, the taste of a brand, the ingredients of a brand. These are all very, very intrinsic to the brand because
        they add to the characteristic of the brand. The inherent aspects or characteristics of the brand is modified

        by the intrinsic aspects of the brand. The extrinsic attributes of the brand also influence the brand, also
        influence the characteristics of brand, but they are not a part of the inherent part of the brand or the offering.

               For example, branding is an extrinsic attribute, packaging is an extrinsic attribute. So, anything that
        adds to the intrinsic aspects of the brand as experienced by the company will form the intrinsic cue and
        anything that is associated with the extrinsic aspects are those aspects that are not an inherent part of the

        brand are extrinsic aspects of the brand or the product. For example, foreign-sounding brand names are
        extrinsic cues. Let us take the example of Park Avenue in the Indian context, Park Avenue is the brand of an

        Indian apparel offering. Essentially, Park Avenue triggers associations of America, associations of fashion,
        associations of the formal aspects of New York and so on and so forth. It is an extrinsic aspect.
               When we talk about an intrinsic aspect of a brand, let us talk about Cadbury Silk for example. Silk has

        got certain intrinsic aspects that adds to the sensory taste of Cadbury. It could be the smooth texture of the
        chocolate, the chocolate flavor, the color, etc. which are innate to the product. When we talk about herbal
        shampoos, some of the herbal shampoo brands contain herbs that could be seen by the consumer. They

        form the intrinsic aspect of the brand. A combination of extrinsic and intrinsic aspects of the brand, influence
        the brand, and hence influence the perception of branding. So extrinsic and intrinsic aspects of a brand, are
        yet another dimension of perception that is useful to branding.

        Perceptual Organization
               This  discuss  another  interesting  aspect  of  perception,  which  is  associated  with  perceptual

        organization. How are stimuli organized together and how does perception happen with respect to thought
        with  respect  to  a  collection  of  thoughts  with  respect  to  a  brand.  There  are  few  aspects  of  perceptual
        organizations that is important for a marketer from the viewpoint of branding. One is for figure and ground.

        The second one is grouping. Third one is closure. And the fourth one is Interpretation.
               All aspects of perceptual organization lend themselves amenable to creativity  with respect of the
        brand, but creativity needs to be implemented within a specific context. When I say specific context, it is

        associated with the competitive context, it is associated with competitive brands, it is associated with the
        target segment, it is associated with the number of aspects concerned with the stimuli with the respect to the
        background in which the stimuli takes shape because the backdrop is something which is very important from

        the viewpoint of interpreting a stimuli.


                                                                                                              45]]></page><page Index="241"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                     Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus

        Figure and Ground
               This discuss each of these aspects of perceptual organization. Let us take, for example, figure and
        ground. Let us consider an advertisement, print advertisement, it could be any kind of advertisement, it could

        be any kind of message for purpose of simplicity, let us take an advertisement. The figure is something which
        is solid, which is concrete, and which is in the forefront, and something which gets contrasted from the ground.
        The ground is hazy. It isn't the backdrop and it gets contrasted from the figure. When you see a picture, it

        could be an art, it could be a photograph, it could be any image, not necessarily an advertisement, the figure
        is the basic image that has our focus. For example, when we are looking at the photograph of a group of
        people, the group of people form the figure, the background with respect to the photograph, the background

        could be a natural scenery, the background could be a screen, the background could be a building, the
        background could be anything, the background gets contrasted from the group of people. So, this is the

        concept of figure and ground.
               The implications are figure and ground with respect to advertisements today whether it is digital or
        otherwise  is  obvious  from  the  viewpoint  of  marketing,  the  message  to  be  conveyed.  The  unique  selling

        proposition of a brand needs to be the figure and the creativity, the music, the jingle, the backdrop, should
        be the ground. If the creativity is of a high order to such an extent that it overshadows the figure, the brand,

        and its proposition would be completely lost. When it is lost, the consumer does not get hold of the message.
        The consumer does not get hold of what the brand stands for. And the entire creativity is remembered by the
        consumer, but the recall and recognition with respect to various aspects of the brand are completely missing

        and advertising or promotion becomes a wasteful effort.
               If we discuss some examples of advertising, it would be clear. Let us take the example of a baby
        product.  Most  of  the  baby  products  like  baby  soap,  baby  oil,  baby  talcum  powder  are  predominantly

        associated with the associations of mother and baby. The mother and baby in most cultures stand for warmth,
        affection, unconditional binding, so on and so forth. They add meaning to whatever has been synced. In the
        process of making warmth and affection and several other aspects of emotion, if the brand tries to provide

        creativity at the cost of the brand name or at the cost of the message or the unique selling proposition of the
        brand, then the figure gets eclipsed by the ground. So very clearly, the creativity part of the ad should be the

        background and essentially the figure should be a unique selling proposition or something which is extremely
        important connected with the brand. Figure and ground from the core aspects of the brand's message.
        Grouping

               Grouping involves grouping different kinds of associations to ensure the brand's associations are well-
        formed in the minds of the consumer. There could be a brand of soap which is lemony in nature, the stimuli

        used in the ads and stimuli used by the brand should be grouped in such a way that the lemony brand of
        soap stands for a refreshing aspect of the soap. It should ensure that the consumer is able to experience
        some aspects of getting himself or herself refreshed when she or he looks at the brand or the packaging or

        the advertisement of the brand. The grouping could also be with respect to the backdrop. For example, coffee
        and tension-filled lifestyle is being grouped. Over a period of time, coffee to stimulate thinking in a corporate

                                                                                                              46]]></page><page Index="242"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                     Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus

        environment to coffee as a part of the lifestyle is getting grouped. So, the challenge for the marketer is to
        ensure what kinds of associations would be suitable to ensure that appropriate grouping takes place so that
        the brand's associations are distinct in the mind of the consumer.

               An interesting example is the case of Liberty footwear. (It is the effectiveness of the example that
        matters more than the contemporariness of the example. While the contemporariness of the example makes
        you get in touch with the environmental trends, the essence of the example and the conceptual aspects of

        the example are equally important. Hence, we take this case of Liberty footwear from several years ago.)
               Many years ago, Liberty footwear came out with an interesting advertisement when the leading brands
        in the environment were doing badly. That was an opportunity for Liberty to establish itself. Liberty wanted to

        convey the proposition that it is a fashionable and modern brand. Hence, it came out with an advertisement
        that featured fashionable cooling glass or goggles, a trendy American fast food and coca cola present in the

        ad. So eventually, it was able to effectively convey the message that Liberty as a brand is on par with the
        cutting-edge fashion as desired by a modern young consumer. By presenting itself in the group that contained
        the representative products of modern American lifestyle, Liberty managed to carve its identity as a modern

        lifestyle brand in the footwear category.
        Closure

               What exactly is closure? Closure in simple terms is the tendency with respect to the individual to
        involuntarily complete stimuli if a part of the stimuli is sensed by him. Please note the important aspects of
        closure. Tendency arises from the individual. The individual attempts to complete a stimuli, which is well

        known to him, which is well-rehearsed by him over a period of time and that happens involuntarily. He simply
        involuntarily completes it.
               Typical example in a non-marketing complex could be remembering our name. If the name is Barack

        Obama for example. Every time somebody hears Barack, there will be a tendency to complete it as Barack
        Obama. The same concept could be extended to your brand. A popular brand like Kellogg, which is very
        popular with the consumers, and this is a brand that could automatically generate associations. And more

        importantly, the consumer is extremely familiar with the brand over a period of time.
               Let us imagine a consumer being presented with the brand name Kellogg's, which is cut into half in

        the print medium. There's an advertisement of Kellogg's where upper end of the brand is very clearly defined,
        but the lower end of the brand is not clearly defined in terms of its individual letters. The K is a letter, E is a
        letter, L is a letter. All those things are good enough to be perceived, but essentially, the lower part of the

        letters are missing that is closure. The consumer, as soon as he sees the name Kellogg, he will have a
        tendency to complete it. The same way, when a consumer here's a popular jingle or background music of a

        brand, for example, for a very long time, Lifebuoy as a brand of soap had a cinema commercial, which was
        shown in the cinema halls in its ads, it is a very catchy jingle was accompanied by a visual. So, over a period
        of time, the consumer gets used to the jingle and the ad, and every time he hears the jingle even without the

        visual, he would be reminded of the visual. So, this is a very powerful part of perception. And it is a, not as
        much used as grouping, but depending on the context the brand could find used to it.

                                                                                                              47]]></page><page Index="243"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY

        Interpretation
               Interpretation  is  another  aspect  of  perceptual  organization.  How  do  we  interpret  the  stimuli?
        Essentially, a brand needs to ensure that the consumer knows the category with which it competes, and

        about how it differentiates itself.
               A typical example could be a case of Red Bull. Red Bull, in fact, competes with soft drinks. The
        consumer knows that the Red Bull competes in the category of soft drinks, but it is a very specialized energy

        drink. So, from the viewpoint of Red Bull, the brand has to ensure that the consumer knows the category with
        which it competes and the consumer also at the same time knows the differentiation to appreciate that Red
        Bull is a subcategory in the category of soft drinks. This is a typical example of interpretation.

               There could be many ways to ensure the brand is interpreted correctly. If, for example, Yogurt is
        introduced in the Indian context. Yogurt is very similar to your curd, but curd is the popular aspect of the

        Indian culture. So, if a company wants to introduce Yogurt, it needs to ensure consumers differentiated it
        adequately from Curd. So, it may be probably be perceived in the category of curd, but how was Yogurt
        differentiated from curd is the challenge for the marketer. So, that brings us to a close on the discussion of

        perceptual organization.
        Conclusion

               This lesson will be completed by highlighting certain applications that would have a strategic impact
        with respect to the brand. In today's competitive world where digitalization is also included, it is essential for
        a brand to appreciate three aspects as important implications with respect to perception and branding.

               The  first  aspect  is  brand  positioning.  How  does  a  brand  position  itself  completely  is  based  on
        perceptual aspects? Second aspect, after a brand positions itself, it has to sustain itself in a competitive field
        which is changing in an extremely fast and radical manner. Hence, re-positioning exercises are required.

        When we study brands either in the Indian context or in a global context, we find that most of the leading
        brands  repositioned  themselves.  Repositioning  involves  modifying  the  perceptual  field  of  the  consumer
        depending on the context in which it is undergoing certain changes. Today, there may be more of youngsters

        coming into the market, billionaires coming into the market, there could be more of digitalization, there could
        be more of associations with respect to competitive brands. So, repositioning involves creating a perceptual

        field to the extent of modifying the existing perceptual field associated with original positioning.
               The third question is equally important. When we talk about modifying the perceptual field between
        the  original  positioning and  the  relaunched  positioning  or the repositioning.  How  should  associations  be

        handled? One aspect to be noted is that perception should always cater to consistent associations among
        the consumers and over a period of time, how are these consistent associations going to be stable in the

        mind of the consumer despite the changes in the environment is a challenge to the marketers. So, striking a
        delicate balance between changing associations as per the situation, and retaining the original associations
        of the brand is the challenge for the marketer as far as perception is concerned.

                                            CONSUMER LEARNING




                Instructional Objectives


               Lesson 5 covers the WEEK 13 - 14 of the course syllabus. After the completion of the lesson,
               students will be able to:
               1.  Determine the importance of learning in the context of branding and consumer behavior.

               2.  Examine the several ways in which a consumer would learn about a brand of a product.
               3.  Discuss the importance of classical conditioning in studying brands and association from the
                   viewpoint of learning.





             I. CONSUMER LEARNING: TYPES AND IMPORTANCE


        Importance of Learning
               As consumers, we keep learning day in and day out and the learning happens spontaneously. Let us

        think about ourselves. Are we using the same kind of cosmetics that we use 10 years back? How is it that
        we have changed? Let us take probably diverse sets of examples from product categories. It could be what
        is known as a vacuumizer, which is completely a new product altogether. It could be iPhone, or it could be

        something like a biscuit. One can easily find out that the kind of learning that occurs with respect to consumers
        when we talk about these diverse products varies from one consumer to another, and more importantly, it

        also varies with respect to the category itself.
               Let us take the case of vacuumizer. What is vacuumizer? A vacuumizer was introduced about 20
        years back when consumer lifestyles were changing in urban cities. A vacuumizer was essentially a pump

        that was used to create vacuum with respect to preservation of wine and very innovatively the marketeer
        thought that it will work in the Indian context. It is even more interesting to note the application of vacuumizer

        in the Indian context. A vacuumizer was used to create a vacuum within a container in which food can be
        preserved. Indians typically preserve food in the refrigerators and a vacuumizer has the added advantage
        that if food is preserved in the vacuumizer it does not give rise to rancidity. Rancidity is one of the major

        problems associated with food storage. This is especially true when it comes to cooked food. Rancidity alters
        the taste, alters the complexion of the food which is stored inside the refrigerator.



                                                                                                              47]]></page><page Index="247"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY

               The brand initially came out with new kind of distribution known as the sales party plan. This had one
        specific consumer demonstrate the product among his neighborhood and other consumers would probably
        pick up the product if they were impressed with it. When this was not working, the company decided to sell it

        through the conventional distribution route. The company took the extra precaution of trying to advertise the
        product in several kinds of media vehicles. It was there on television. It was there on newspapers. It was
        there on a variety of media. Despite these efforts, the question is, did the product succeed? So, the first

        message for the marketeer is that the marketeer would be interested in imparting learning to the consumer
        in a certain manner, but the consumer may not really be receptive to this kind of learning.
               Let us take the case of biscuits. Biscuit is a commonplace product. All of us know that, people from

        different kinds of age groups enjoy it and there are a variety of well-known brands in the Indian context. One
        can easily see that the involvement associated with learning associated with biscuits is very different from

        that which was associated with vacuumizer. There are differences with respect to products, differences with
        respect to usage, and differences with respect to how different sets of consumers from different segments
        even perceive it.

               Let us take the case of iPad or iPod or iPhone. The receptivity among consumers is so strong that
        consumers not only buy these products, many consumers learn how to use them and the diffusion or the

        spread of these products is almost revolutionary. The question is how did consumers learn with respect to
        iPhone and how did they not learn or were reluctant to learn when it came to vacuumizer. And in between,
        there is some learning that is going on with respect to these kids.

               Learning therefore, explores a number of aspects associated with how consumers learn. There are
        three things important from the viewpoint of learning. One, the consumer must have the motivation to learn.
        It has to come from within. The second point is that the marketeer has to ensure that whatever he says about

        his offering or the offering itself has to be in line with the consumer's motivation. And that's not the end of the
        story. The marketeer will have to ensure that the learning he imparts, or the company imparts is superior to
        the learning imparted by the competitors. So, these three basic aspects of learning are to be borne in mind

        before we go further into learning concepts.
        What is Learning?

               Learning is a process that evolves from changes as consumers acquire knowledge from experience
        and observations and interactions with others. There are several important aspects of this definition.
               First thing is it is a process, which also means that it is continuous. A consumer learns about products,

        services, circumstances, situations, categories, almost throughout his life. This can be any type of consumer.
        This can be a consumer who is struggling to make both ends meet, or it could be a consumer who is very

        rich and has a lot of discretionary income.
               Second aspect is that learning is dynamic. That was the reason why I asked you, do we use the same
        kind of cosmetics that we were using 10 years back?

               Third aspect is that there is knowledge, knowledge from experience, observations, and interactions
        with  others.  Essentially,  we  are  not  learning  in isolation. We are  learning  through  social  media. We  are

                                                                                                              48]]></page><page Index="248"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                     Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus

        learning through advertising. We are learning through our friends. There is constant interaction with others.
        There is also observation with respect to others and we have our own experiences.
               So, the impregnated definition has a lot of messages are as the learning definition is concerned. Now,

        Let us take a look at what are the basics of learning. We have already talked about what a stimulus is all
        about. A stimulus is any input, any of the sensory organs and the response is all about from the consumer
        set. So, a stimulus could be from the marketeer, it could be from the environment, it could be from anywhere,

        and it could be anything. It could be a brand, a product, category person, et cetera. And the response is the
        way one responds to the stimuli.
               This SR relationship (S is the Stimulus, R is the response) is the fundamental platform on which the

        behavioral theories of learning are based. If stimulus-response is not there, there is no learning that takes
        place.

        Behavioral Learning
               These  are  the  basic  aspects  of  behavioral  learning.  There  are  four  things  to  be  noted  as  far  as
        behavioral learning is concerned: motives, cues, response, and reinforcement.

               Motive is from within the consumer as I had already said, the consumer should feel like learning.
               In this context, cues come from the environment. The cue could be an advertisement from a brand.

        The cue could be probably our discussion from a friend. A cue could be a picture from the social media. A
        cue could be from the point of purchase at the shop.
               Response is the response of the consumer.

               And  reinforcement  is  the  most  important  aspect  of  stimulus-response  relationship  because
        reinforcement actually leads to brand loyalty. Reinforcement of the stimulus-response done with commitment
        from the consumer's end, and it leads to brand loyalty.

               For example, let us talk about the motive to buy a car. The consumer goes around searching for
        information. There are a lot of cues from the environment. So, the motive is to buy a car. The motive can
        depend on fuel saving. The motive can depend on safety. The motive can depend on a status. The motive

        can depend on family fun. It could be a combination of these factors. This essentially motivates a consumer
        to move towards a brand.

               The cues, of course, the advertisements from various kinds of brands. The consumer eventually, after
        discussion with his friends, after considering his own resources after probably taking note of his memory
        response, he responds by going to the point of purchase at the shop and he selects a particular brand. The

        particular brand, over a period of time, gives him the experience, gives him some indication of how the
        motives have been fulfilled and eventually, he or she may start liking the brand. This is where SR relationships

        take shape. Once it take shape, he gets used to the particular brand and that results in loyalty.
               It is very interesting to observe that Nokia was a tremendous success in the mobile industry before it
        decided to discontinue itself. It was brought back into the market in an updated manner, it received positive

        response from the consumers. This shows how motive, cues, response, and reinforcement function and in



                                                                                                              49]]></page><page Index="249"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                     Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus

        the case of Nokia, the consumer liking was so high that the company decided to bring back the brand. So,
        this forms the basic introduction to learning.
        Stimulus – Response Relationship

               Before going into the types of learning, you need to have an idea about the importance of stimulus-
        response aspects to brands. These are all classical ways of dealing with brands. Brands are the front office
        which is visible to consumers, and consumer behavior with its classical underpinnings form the back office

        and  stimulus-response  is  one  of  the  most  powerful  ways  to  understand  brand  repositioning,  brand
        revitalization, and how a brand gets itself updated depending on the changes in environment.
               Stimulus-responses associated with two important aspects. The first aspect is the association. Mere

        association of the stimulus-response seems to make an impressionable point in the mind of the consumer.
        The second aspect is what is known as extinction.

               The first aspect association can lead to forgetting. The second aspect extinction deals with rewards.
        Rewards are what the consumer receives from the brand. Associations can lead to the consumer forgetting
        the associations. Extinction happens when the reward from the brand stops and the consumers no longer

        receives the same kind of reward, which he or she was receiving probably before the environment changed.
               Let me explain this with respect to a few examples. Let us take the case of iPod. The iPod is essentially

        a mechanism with which songs can be stored. At the time when iPod was launched or before the time when
        iPod was launched, there was a CD player. There were certain illegal online portals like Napster, which
        people were using to download their songs. Computers also had a CD playback facility. Let us take the case

        of how iPod emphasized a specific habit by offering several kinds of advantages over the existing product
        categories.
               The Napster was a legal website and it was closed. The conventional CD player was good enough,

        but the only problem is that when the consumer was forced to buy a CD, it would have a number of songs
        and some of the songs he may not like. There is no option for the consumers to record something completely
        based on his choice and play it back. iPod was ideal and in association with its collaborator, iTunes from

        Sony, it literally wrote history. This gives us an idea about how the extinction is brought about by changes in
        the environment. The CD became obsolete almost overnight with iPod doing the job and at a later point in

        time, MP3 appearing on the scene.
               So, the message number one, as far as stimulus-response is concerned, is that the brand should stay
        itself updated in terms of what it offers. It could be product development, it could be launching new features,

        it  could  be  a  technological  development,  it  could  be  anything.  The  point  is  that  the  stimulus-response
        relationships should ensure that extinction does not take place.

               The second case happens when stimulus-response is forgotten. In the sense, the product may be
        good enough. But the consumer over a period of time forgets about the product because the visibility with
        respect to the stimulus or the brand is no longer there. This is one of the reasons why well-known brands

        keep advertising throughout the year. The whole idea is to ensure that they are there on the top of the mind
        recall as far as the consumer segments are concerned.

                                                                                                              50]]></page><page Index="250"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY

               Eno was a product used for relieving oneself of intestinal gas and the brand is about 50 years old.
        Over  a  period  of time  with market  slowly  changing  in terms  of  customer  lifestyle  several  other  products
        appearing for the control of intestinal gas Eno had to come back with an advertising campaign that talked

        about how well it compares with seven other alternatives, which were available on the market.
               This is an example to show how not only the product is superior, the brand has to be in the mind of
        the consumer. If the brand doesn't advertise, if the brand is not spoken about on the social media, if the brand

        doesn't reinforce its associations in tune with what is happening with respect to consumers' life, the brand is
        likely to be forgotten.
               It may be a good point to observe the Bru coffee brand which started itself as a filter coffee offering

        slowly talked about the kind of relationships that exist between a husband and wife or romantic relationships,
        thereby, making it relevant to the consumer lifestyles and also ensuring that the product offering gets updated

        in the form of reformulation. This would have given you some idea about the importance of stimulus-response
        relationships and their impact with respect to branding.
        Types of Learning

               These  briefly  explain  the  different  kinds  of  learning  that  could  happen  from  the  viewpoint  of  the
        consumer mindset. These are kinds of learning that were advocated by psychologists long back, and they

        still hold good in the digital age.
               Let me start with Classical Conditioning as a learning theory. It will explain more  deeply about
        classical conditioning subsequently in this lesson, but for the time being, it is learning by associations. When

        we think of the British brand, Yardley, we think of English associations, we think of the British queen, we think
        about several classical things that are associated with Yardley. The question is from where we did we get
        these associations? When we think of BMW brand of car, several associations come to our mind. It’s German.

        It's the ultimate driving machine. It signals the status yet a sporty fee; it is sexy. The motorcycle of BMW was
        used in the James Bond movie. Where do these associations come from?
               Essentially, consumer learns through associations, and that is to do with classical conditioning. Let

        us go into operant or instrumental conditioning. Essentially, operant or instrumental conditioning is all
        about learning by rewards. A simple example in the Indian context would be the petrol bunks which are

        located in several parts of the city. There could be about five, six petrol bunks in a particular road or that
        could be about two petrol bunks or there could be about five, six petrol bunks within a given vicinity. Imagine
        a petrol bunk where the car or motorcycle is welcomed by the service personnel in a highly receptive manner.

        It could be small things like wiping off the dust from the car. It could be two people running to attend on the
        consumer. It  could  be  somebody  helping the  consumer  with  opening  the  petrol  tank.  Compare this  with

        another petrol bunk where the service is indifferent. The car goes and stops there. Nobody is worried about
        it. You wait for some time, call out to people, you need to be very careful about how they handle your patrol
        cap. That tells you a lot about instrumental conditioning. It could be with respect to the petrol bunk, it could

        be with respect to your brand of tea, it could be with respect to even an airline. There are several airline
        brands, which are operating in the country. Many consumers are particular about a specific Airline brand,

                                                                                                              51]]></page><page Index="251"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY

        why? Because they feel the airline handles the flights on time. They feel the airline is courteous, the airline
        does many things which are positive when the customer wanted to take the flight. This is known as apparent
        conditioning.

               Cognitive learning presumes that the consumer doesn't learn by association. He/she does not learn
        by robot, but he learns through his approaches towards problem-solving. Very interestingly, problem-solving
        can happen with respect to several of our everyday needs and wants. We may get into problem-solving mode

        when we want to buy a new pair of shoes or when we want to buy a new mobile phone. So essentially, this
        presumes that the consumer looks for information in the environment and tries to solve the problems that are
        associated with his needs and wants. Problem in the sense of selecting an offering that will fit into his needs,

        that's what his problem all about or it could be the problem of a mobile phone breaking down and opting for
        a new one and in the process, the consumer tries to have a problem-solving approach.

               For example, urban youngster presuming that he/she was able to afford to buy a higher-priced mobile
        would want to look at several features and trying to signal the status can only be one of them. He may be
        interested in the Bluetooth interface. He may be interested in the video streaming. He may be interested in

        knowing to what extent it can hold onto the apps. He may be interested in knowing how screen-friendly the
        mobile is, he may be interested in how quickly the service problems could be solved. So, as you can see,

        cognitive learning is associated with the problem-solving approach.

             II. CLASSICAL CONDITIONING THEORY OF LEARNING

               Given the importance of classical conditioning in terms of associations with brands. I thought I will

        elaborate  this  theory  so  that  you  would  know  how  this  is  applied  to  brands.  This  is  a  very  interesting
        phenomenon because what you think about one relationship is applied to another relationship. I use the word

        phenomenon because though the theory is well explained by Pavlov, it becomes important to understand
        that the transfer of emotions, the transfer association is something which happens in the mind, and it may be
        very difficult to provide an in-depth aspect about why something appeals to somebody the way it appeals.

               Classical conditioning is extremely relevant today. Not only because it is used in advertisements, but
        it can also have an impact with respect to social media. For instance, when you read about a description of

        a brand or a service or an occasion written by your friend on the social media, impressions and associations
        start forming in your mind.
               Let me start with a few examples. Puppies and warmth. When we take a look at puppies, we find

        them to be likable and there is some degree of warmth with respect to most of us when we see a puppy. This
        probably holds good throughout the universe. After the onset of cafes like Starbucks and Cafe Coffee Day,

                                                                                                              52]]></page><page Index="252"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                     Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus

        and different kinds of cafes, we find that there is a very strong association between friends, fun, and coffee.
        How did this suddenly come into the picture is a question. From a different domain, Let us take the case of
        Rolex watch and prestige. Rolex watch symbolizes prestige. It is worn by successful people, it is a Swiss

        watch, it is classic in terms of its timelessness, and where did we learn these associations? How did we learn
        these associations is the crux of the theory associated with classical conditioning?
               Let me explain the process in which associations are formed. As it was explained by Pavlov. There is

        something  known  as  the  unconditional  stimuli.  Unconditional  stimuli  elicit  some  unconditional  response.
        Going back to the example, puppy is an unconditional stimulus. Warmth is an unconditional response. It is
        important to note that the response is spontaneous. You don't think about the warmth, whether you want to

        love the puppies and then decide to have warmth- it is just spontaneous. Now, we are talking about the brand
        of watch called Rolex and its association with prestige. You can very clearly see that when I talked about

        puppies and coffee, I'm not talking about brands when I'm talking about Rolex, it's just not the premium watch
        that is associated with the prestige word. It's a specific brand of watch that is associated with prestige. Now,
        the process will explain to us how such associations come into the picture in the consumer's mind.

               For example, the mother-child relationship is an unconditional stimulus. Mother-child relationship is
        important throughout the world, whether one is educated or not, whether one is rich or not, regardless of

        where one lives, mother-child relationship is something that is associated with warmth, affection, feelings,
        and this is not true of only the human race, it is true of almost all kinds of species which live in this world. So,
        that's an unconditional response. The feeling of warmth, the feeling of affection, the feeling of likability, the

        feeling of bonding is an unconditional response.
               Now, let us take the case of a baby food. It could be any brand. It could be a multinational brand. It
        could be an Indian brand. It could be an ethnic brand. The brand is the conditional stimuli. The conditional

        stimuli need to be paired with unconditional stimuli. The brand of the baby food needs to be associated with
        the  association  of  mother  and  baby.  We  already  noted  that  the  unconditional  stimuli  give  rise  to  the
        unconditional  response.  The  mother-baby  warmth  gives  rise  to  the  spontaneous  feeling  when  there  is

        repeated  pairing  of  the  baby  food  brand  with  mother-child  relationships.  Conditional  response  happens
        through the unconditional response, which means that the brand has received the associations that were

        associated with mother and child. Over a period of time, psychologically, the consumer connects the brand
        of baby food with very, very warm relationships of mother and child. Now one can imagine why the mother
        probably the specific brand of baby food again and again. We do understand that the baby food is also

        effective in terms of its performance, in terms of its benefits, but at the same time, the associations get
        created.

        Classical Conditioning
               There are a few other important points associated with classical conditioning. For example, when a
        celebrity is introduced, we can talk about celebrities like Shah Rukh Khan and Amitabh Bachchan in the

        Indian context. They have modelled for a variety of brands. They continue to model for a variety of brands,
        and their endorsement of brands has been probably more than two decades. When we talk about a celebrity

                                                                                                              53]]></page><page Index="253"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                     Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus

        getting associated with a brand. For example, Amitabh Bachchan being associated with the brand of scooter
        called  Jupiter.  The  celebrity  conveys,  the  likability  conveys,  trustworthiness  conveys  the  grace  to  the
        consumer, and the brand, in turn, receives the qualities and characteristics of the celebrity. Over a period of

        time, the celebrity gets strongly associated with the brand. Probably India is one market that uses diverse
        kinds of celebrities and diverse kinds of product categories and several multinational brands have started
        using celebrities.

               The important message which needs to be noted is that the unconditional stimuli should have a strong
        connect with culture. Cricket celebrities and film celebrities are part of Indian culture. There is no logic which
        goes into the picture. One logic is that the celebrity maybe an expert with respect to the category which he

        or she is endorsing. For example, when Anne Curtis endorses a brand of cosmetics, she's probably presumed
        or  perceived  to  know  everything  about  the  cosmetic  because  she's  in  the  business  of  beauty,  which  is

        associated with filmdom. But apart from this logic, there is likability, there is trustworthiness, there are several
        other psychological factors which get transferred to the brand. Even a German brand like Nivea has started
        using celebrities in the Indian context. The cultural connect with respect to celebrity is important.

               The second aspect to be noted is that unconditional stimuli which is used along with the conditional
        stimuli which is the brand should not take away too much of attention to the extent of the brand being viewed

        as a background stimuli. One can see the delicate balance which is required with respect to the associations.
        The unconditional aspect of the stimuli should have a rub off on the brand. At the same time, the brand image
        should get registered with respect to the consumer's mind. So, there is a delicate balance that is required

        between the usage of the celebrity and the extent to which the brand is at the forefront of the consumer
        psyche.
               Now, you will be able to appreciate the job of the brand manager, which is to ensure the brand's

        proposition and the brand name does not get relegated to the backdrop because of very strong unconditional
        stimuli used. The unconditional stimuli may be a celebrity, maybe a natural scenery, maybe something which
        is of interest to the consumer, may be of intense intensity in terms of what it can evoke. It can evoke a

        pleasant emotion. It can evoke a good feeling regardless of the characteristic of the unconditional stimuli.
        The marketer has to ensure that there's a proper balance with respect to the conditional stimuli and the

        unconditional stimuli that ensures the brand is always at the forefront.
               This challenge is even more important when a brand starts revitalizing and repositioning itself. Let us
        take the case of Lifebuoy. Lifebuoy is a brand which is more than five decades in the Indian context. Over a

        period of time, Lifebuoy which stands for germ-killing action has added a number of associations has modified
        a number of associations. It advertises on the television, it advertises on social media, it advertises for a

        variety of occasions, but one can see that there is a very strong focus with respect to the classical conditioning
        with respect to the focus on the brand’s proposition. The associations are so managed that the brand's unique
        selling proposition is not compromised at all.

                  For  better  understanding,  try  to  watch  the  videos  about  classical  conditioning  and  theory  of  learning

              III. APPLICATIONS OF CLASSICAL CONDITIONING




        Application of Classical Conditioning – Part 1
               After the discussion about creating associations and the mechanism of the creation of associations,
        let us move on to certain important and interesting applications of classical conditioning. They are not only

        interesting they are challenging as well for the brand manager. I'll try to relate the application of classical
        conditioning to the extent possible to the real world by providing an example. One of the important points to
        be noted with respect to learning of associations is that there are a number of concepts which are intertwined

        together. These are not concepts that can be used sequentially. These are not concepts that can be used in
        a linear manner. These are not concepts that can be used with respect to a question and an answer. These

        are concepts that are holistic in nature, and they need to be used in conjunction with one another depending
        on the situation and depending on the context.
               Let us start with our developing associations which has to do with the strengths of associations. When

        we talk about the strengths of associations, we need to make a reference to what is known as the schema.
        When we make a reference to schema, we need to talk about nodes, which are a part of the schema. We

        need to also talk about the consumer's psyche of encoding. We need to talk about brand imprinting as well.
        So, please note, consumer mind is involved, the brand's association is involved. A set of associations called
        as schema is involved. In between the set of associations there are information nodes which are stored in

        the mind known as nodes. They are involved. Four or five aspects are involved when we talk about how
        associations are deepened or strengthened and how associations can be managed by a brand.
               It is to be noted that today's brand is not a single entity in terms of its offering. The brand manages a

        product line. The product line can consist of several variants of the brand. The product line consists of several
        sub-brands.  So,  from  the  viewpoint  of  creating  associations,  and  from  the  viewpoint  of  sustaining
        associations, a brand manager has to be sensitive to the fact that associations need to be created. They

        need to be strengthened, modified, and adapted to sub-brands. They need to be updated over a period of
        time, and they need to appeal to specific respective target segments. So, one can see the type of challenges

        that associations offer in terms of connecting the brand with the consumer.
               Let us just take the example of Colgate. Colgate is a multinational brand which is almost in every
        household or which is well-known among several households. Colgate has been in the country for several

        decades. The very mention of the Colgate brand sets off associations of trust, associations  of oral care,
        associations of gum care, associations of the doctor in a white coat, associations of children using it, even at

        random we are able to get all of several associations. How are these associations managed by the brand or
        how can they be managed? What are the lessons to be learned from the brand? These are some of the
        things which we can discuss with the help of a few concepts.

               One  is  the  schema.  Schema  is  a  set  of  associations  associated  with  the  specific  domain,  the
        consumer's mind or the individual's mind is so functioning that he carries sets of associations with respect to

                                                                                                              56]]></page><page Index="256"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                     Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus

        different domains in his life. It could be with respect to your brand, it could be with respect to a product
        category, it could be with respect to religion, it could be with respect to education, it could be with respect to
        politics, it could be with respect to his lifestyle, it could be with respect to events, it could be with respect to

        places. You can see the endless kinds of domains that are created in a consumer's throughout his life. A
        schema, for the purpose of understanding, is a set of associations concerning a domain. Again, as I told you,
        it can be very subjective, it depends on person to person, it depends on a host of psychological mechanisms

        that operate with respect to the individual's mind. So, there's nothing generalized about the schema except
        that it's a set of associations that are associated with the particular domain.
               Let us explain what is nodes. A node is a point where some information is carried. As I told you,

        Colgate can have the node of a user. The Colgate can have the node of toothpaste, a graphic. Colgate can
        have the node of red because the packaging comes in red. Colgate can have the node of an elderly person.

        The Colgate can have a node of a youngster because they have max fresh, which is a youngsters brand.
        Colgate can also trigger off some associations of a multinational brand. The most interesting point to be noted
        is that when an individual thinks of a node, it triggers some other node. When somebody thinks of Colgate

        that can trigger the node of a child. When somebody thinks of the teeth of a child that can trigger of Colgate.
        So, the triggering of associations between the nodes is something to be taken care of.

               Let me explain what Encoding is. Encoding is a process by which a consumer assigns a symbol or a
        word to what he has been perceived. This becomes very interesting. The consumer assigns a symbol or a
        word, for example, the swoosh symbol of Nike is strongly entrenched in the mind of the consumer. So, he

        has assigned swoosh to represent Nike, to represent the Americanization, to represent youth, to represent a
        positive attitude, to represent fitness, to represent aesthetic footwear, to represent symbolism in footwear.
        You can see the swoosh brand could stand for a variety of things and the stronger the encoding with respect

        to your focus the better it is. Should a consumer think of all associations or should a consumer think of a
        swoosh?
               And the beauty of the subject Consumer Behavior is that there is no rule that every brand should have

        a logo like a swoosh. It's all a question of how well the brand has managed target segment, the thinking of
        target segment, so on and so forth. So, the consumer is able to encode something with respect to a brand. If

        it is a Titan, it could be probably gifting. If it's Italy, it could be fashion. If it's going to be France, it could be
        wine. France can also stand for fashion. If it's going to Germany, it's going to be perfection. So, we can see
        that the encoding takes place in the mind of the consumer, but how it takes place probably is partly within the

        grasp of the marketer. He has the challenge to ensure that the consumer selects the proper encoding, a
        specific symbol or focus symbol at the same time. He also has to ensure that the competitive associations

        do not get into the consumer's mind. For instance, a brand of watch promoting gifting probably will make
        Titan stronger because Titan is strongly associated with gifting.
               The third aspect is imprinting. Brand imprinting is associated with the strengthening of association

        between  the  brand  and  the  information.  We  have  already  said  that  the  each  of  the  nodes  carry  some
        information. For example, the link between NutriChoice from Britannia and Health is very strong when we

                                                                                                              57]]></page><page Index="257"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                     Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus

        talk about brand imprinting of NuitriChoice from Britannia. The brand imprinting with respect to the example
        which we have taken Colgate possibly could be oral care with trust. It could possibly be the doctor's coat or
        the doctor appearing in a white coat.

               So, one can very clearly see when brand associations are formed, nurtured, maintained, modified
        schema of the consumer should be taken into account, nodes should be taken into account, the symbol that
        is used for encoding from the consumers and needs to be taken into account, the strength of association

        which is reflected with respect to brand imprinting needs to be taken into account because the strength of
        association possibly has an impact on brand recall.
               A brand recall is a very important and vital characteristic with respect to brand association. There may

        be a number of other parameters. This example, which I have explained with the set of concepts should be
        able to give you an idea about the host of marketing research tools that are employed by the marketeer to

        probe into the consumer's mind.
               So, point number one: There are several concepts that need to be used simultaneously to probe to
        the consumer's mind as far as associations are concerned.

               Point number two: Associations need to take into account the long-term aspects of sustaining the
        associations.

               That's about brand imprinting, encoding, schema, nodes, and the strength of associations.
        Application of Classical Conditioning – Part 2
               There are many other applications of classical conditioning. Let us take a look at two of them very

        briefly.
               One aspect which I had observed in the Indian context is the unusual aspect of counter segmentation
        being associated with associations. It all depends on how the brand manager or the marketer is able to

        conceptualize the situation with the concept. So, this is something which is not limited by the concepts. It's
        not like reading mathematics; there are inputs from the concept, there are inputs from the environment, it is
        for the brand manager to decide how well he's able to integrate these two aspects and create a subjective

        world that will be useful to the brand.
               Counter segmentation typically happens when a brand possibly has a segment that may not really be

        feasible. In the sense that, the brand initially launches an offering for a segment and later point in time realizes
        that the segment is not adequate and tries to enlarge the segment in whatever appropriate manner it can.
        There are a lot of examples available from different countries, I will take the example of a product from Titan.

        This is not to imply that the initial segment was not adequate. I am only making use of this for a conceptual
        purpose to highlight how the variant of counter segmentation can be used by a brand. Even assuming that

        the initial segment created by Titan was sufficient. This is an interesting example to show how the variant of
        counter segmentation can be used through brand associations. Titan had come out with a brand called Zoop
        for kids, and at a later point in time, it extended itself to the teenagers by associating the brand with respect

        to a movie launch, and the movie was Ironman.



                                                                                                              58]]></page><page Index="258"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY

               So, this is an example of how associations get extended, not only with respect to the existing segment
        but with respect to another segment and I should say that this is the variant of the application of the concept
        called counter segmentation. The idea of using the example of the concept is to put across the message that

        concepts by themselves will not help a brand. Concepts will have to be conceptualized with situation taken
        into account to ensure that a brand benefits.
               Finally, relationships and brands. Can relationships be built with brands? The answer is yes. Susan

        Fournier, a well-known researcher in the area of brand relationships advocated that brands can have their
        relationships with respect to consumers. For instance, fast food like MTR, MTR is a Bangalore based fast
        forward or the fast food can be something from a company like ITC. How can a fast-food brand develop its

        relationship with the consumer as a everyday friend? It is a challenge to the brand. In terms of recipe it offers
        it can be a friend, in terms of organizing an event it can be a friend, in terms of suggesting a new recipe to a

        housewife it can be a friend, in terms of serving the quick need of a youngster on the go it can be a friend, in
        terms of serving a nutritious meal for someone who's on diet it can be a friend. There are several feelings
        associated to friendship. It can be warmth. It can be dependability. It can be trustworthiness. So, one can

        really  see  tremendous  opportunities  that  exist  with  respect  to  brand-consumer  relationships.  In  another
        domain of energy drinks, Red Bull can have a relationship with the youngsters. Red Bull symbolizes party.

        Red bull symbolizes fun. Red bull symbolizes togetherness. Like interpersonal relationships, brand-consumer
        relationships possibly could be one of the ways through which a loyal relationship can be achieved.

               I. CONCEPTUALIZATION OF CONSUMER BEHAVIOR


               The first and the foremost important aspect with respect to application of consumer behavior is the
        object of conceptualization. This aspect of conceptualization is difficult to learn from the books. It's where

        conceptual aspects of the subject are applied to marketing practice. Let us learn the same by understanding
        some of the scenarios where conceptualization of consumer behavior can be applied.
               There are many aspects that one needs to investigate. One of the aspects is perhaps the industry

        structure. The second aspect could be the competitive structure. The third aspect possibly could be the
        manner in which of brands are positioned. The fourth aspect could be the respective target audience. It may
        not be possible to strictly provide a formula on how one should go about the conceptualization, but it is

        possible to provide an appreciative view of how conceptualization could be done.
               Let me give you some examples. Let us consider the different kinds of product categories like soaps

        or green tea. Or even a new product category like an air fryer in the Indian context. All three categories vary
        in terms of their application, and in terms of the kind of involvement it generates with respect to the consumer's
        mind.


                                                                                                              59]]></page><page Index="261"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                     Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus

               Let us consider a brand like Dove. Dove is a very popular brand of soap and it is positioned on its
        moisturizing ability with respect to the skin. If consumer behavior is to be applied to Dove, possibly one could
        think of evaluating the brand equity in terms of the feelings, attributes, and judgments made. That could be

        one aspect of conceptualization. If we talk about the green tea, it is still at a nascent stage, and Lipton today
        advertises green tea in association with the context of youngsters exercising or getting into some kind of a
        sports activity. So, perhaps the attitude towards the category itself can be investigated.

               When we think of a product category like Air Fryer, Air Fryer is completely new to the  Philippine
        context. We know that in the recent times, health and fitness have become a very strong priority, at least in
        the  urban  context.  Several  professionals  who  are  busy  with  respect  to  their  lifestyle  and  work  in  highly

        pressurized environment have shifted their focus on eating as healthy as possible. Air Fryer is a device that
        makes use of a minimum amount of oil in terms of food preparation and appeals to the health-conscious

        consumer base. The challenge here is despite the presence of multinational brands, how could consumer
        interest be created in the category? Or in other words, how consumers’ attitude could be monitored with
        respect to not just the brand, but with respect to the development of the category.

               It could be noted that the consumer's attitude towards the green tea and the consumer's attitude
        towards Air Fryer differs on several other aspects. One is the level of involvement. Second aspect is the

        choices available. Third aspect is the type of investment they are getting into. Many of these things dictate
        conceptualization with respect to consumer behavior.
               We can also get into several other examples. One more example could be Nivea brand. Nivea is a

        multinational brand from Germany catering to the skincare and personal care segment. Nivea’s bathing gel
        is something which is new to the Indian context. The Indian context is full of soaps and soap bars, and slowly
        consumers may want to switch to bathing gel. Nivea today advertisers bathing gel in comparison with the

        soap bars and says that bathing gel of Nivea provides better moisturizing effect as compared to soaps. It is
        interesting  to  note  that  Dove  is  also  positioned  on  the  moisturizing  aspect.  So,  when  we  talk  about
        conceptualization, a marketer may be interested in comparing the intrinsic attributes of the Nivea bathing gel

        with intrinsic attributes of Dove soap.
               Now,  we  are  beginning  to  conceptualize  several  other  aspects  related  to  consumer  behavior.

        Consumer behavior base could come from perception. It could come from associations. It could come from
        attitude. It could come from personality. So, there are several ways in which each of these aspects could be
        conceptualized.

               For the benefit of viewers. I am trying to divide the approach into several pointers. What is to be borne
        in mind is that I am giving you some idea about the practical aspects of applying consumer behavior, but

        what is required is the application of marketing research techniques. Without the application of marketing
        research techniques, the conceptualization cannot be operationalized. This is the reason why one should
        also go through a course in marketing research.

               II. CONSUMER PROFILING

        Basics of Consumer Profiling
               This will give you some idea about what psychographics is with respect to the target segment. In the

        area of consumer products, regardless of the product category, consumer psychographics forms an important
        aspect  of  conceptualization.  There  are  two  aspects  with  respect  to  consumer  profiling.  One  is  the

        demographic, which is the scientific distribution of population in terms of age, income, educational aspects,
        et cetera. The demographics talks about who buys the product or the brand. The psychographics talks about
        why the product is bought.

               When  we  talk  about  psychographics,  it's  a  combination  of  the  application  of  self-concept  with
        personality  traits,  with  the  values  chosen  by  the  consumer,  and  the  lifestyle  of  the  consumer.  Let  me

        elaborate. What is lifestyle? Lifestyle is the manner in which a consumer spends his money and time. When
        we talk about the value with respect to consumer, it is to be understood that this value is not to be confused
        with the brand value. The value with respect to consumer's mindset is to do with the choice of the preferred

        mode of living. How does a consumer want to live? Does the consumer want to make money in terms of
        materialism? Does the consumer want freedom? Does the consumer want self-esteem? Does the consumer
        want adventure? As you can see, the various kinds of choices by which the consumer can live, and value is

        the preferred mode of living with respect to a consumer.
               A combination of several aspects is psychographics. The combination of self-concept, which are the
        thoughts about oneself, along with the personality traits combined with the lifestyle, combined with values,

        these are the four aspects, which fundamentally form what is known as psychographics and psychographics
        are expressed in terms of activities, interests, and opinions. It should be noted that activities, interests, and

        opinions  called  as  AIO  is  to  be  focused  with  respect  to  the  category  and  the  brand,  which  is  under
        consideration.
               For example, if you're considering a brand of watch or the category of watch, the activities, interests,

        and opinions could be centered around the various kinds of aspects, which are to do with the watch. The way
        the watch is used, the way the watch is advertised, the way the watch is bought, the way probably the watch

        is connected with a hobby. (For example, the sports could be a hobby with respect to the consumer and in
        sports there could be cricket, which is of interest to the consumer.)






                                                                                                              61]]></page><page Index="263"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                     Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus

               So, an ardent follower of cricket would be interested in knowing the match score in which case the
        aspect of how the score gets accessed by the smart watch could be a link between the hobbies and the
        watch. I'm giving you a hypothetical example, there are several ways in which the activities, interests, and

        opinions could be approached with respect to a product category and a brand.
        Psychographics
               Using  these  two  kinds  of  consumer  segments  for  example,  executive-1  belongs  to  a  consumer

        segment and executive two belongs to another consumer segment. If you take executive-1, he spends on
        status symbols. He believes in attending parties. He believes in taking foreign vocation. He has very high
        aspirations about himself and his children. He participates in trendy events, lives in a posh locality. This you

        can see is representative of one segment.
               Take for example, the other executives, executive-2, who represents another segment. He's thrifty in

        terms of his money. He is family oriented. He is deeply religious. He's not as ambitious as the executive one
        spends on necessities, tries to save, lives in his ancestral house, believes in some kinds of tradition, you can
        see that there is a significant difference between executive one and executive two.

               The point to be noted is that executive one and two maybe colleagues in a corporate setting and there
        may be earning the same amount of salary. The way they have their lifestyles, the way they spend their

        money, the way they spend their time is the significant differences with respect to their psychographics.
               So, that should give you some idea about what psychographics is all about. So, to begin with, the
        conceptualization needs to be followed with psychographics. The reason is that the psychographics has an

        impact on what is a value with respect to your brand has an impact on where the segment lives, has an
        impact on how the segment chooses their vocation, so on and so forth.

              III. VALUE ASSOCIATED WITH BRANDS


               Value is an important aspect because it forms the foundation for several other marketing activities
        concerning promotion, concerning pricing, concerning several aspects including where the brand should be

        advertised to reach their target segment.
               There  are  three  kinds  of  values  that  could  be  associated  with  a  brand.  Just  for  clarity,  please
        remember that I've already clarified the difference between the value associated with the brand and the value

        associated with respect to consumers' choice of lifestyle. The three kinds of values are functional value,
        symbolic value, and experiential value. It is to be noted that these kinds of values are not mutually exclusive.

        Let me give you an example to illustrate this. Take for example, Red Bull. Red Bull is an energy drink. The
        Red Bull has the functional value of keeping you away from sleep. It has a symbolic value when you use Red
        Bull to celebrate, partying along with your friends. Red Bull also has an experiential or the sensual value of

        giving you the sensual pleasure when you consume it physically. You can see that it has got three kinds of
        values. The point is, which is the value the consumer segment is interested in? What kinds of overlap all they

        interested in?
               When you are talking about an event, when you talk about an advertising, when you want to promote
        a brand, which is the value that should be dominant? Which functions as the value proposition of the brand?

        If you take example of iPhone, the iPhone is associated with all these values. The iPhone is capable of a
        multitude of functions, which is a functional value. The iPhone is symbolic all over the world. It's a premium
        phone, which possibly could be extended as an extension of your own personality. It has got an experiential

        value because of the user's interface with iPhone. It feels good to handler iPhone. Again, research has to
        clearly spell out what kinds of values the consumer is interested in.
               The second aspect is to do with the cultural beliefs concerning the respective category. When we

        consider the category of gold in India, Tanishq is a leading brand in the category. There are also several
        other leading brands in the category. It should be noted as a marketer, there should be some amount of

        sensitivity to the cultural beliefs associated with gold. Let us quickly take a look at the various kinds of beliefs
        associated with gold. Gold can be associated with prosperity. Gold can also be associated with the divinity.
        Gold can be associated with sterling standards. Gold can be associated with religious rituals. Gold can be

        associated with classism; gold can be associated with fashion. As you can see, there are various kinds of
        cultural beliefs associated with most of the categories they need to be taken into account.

              IV. ACT OF SHOPPING

               We can see that today, in the Filipino context, there is a hybrid of offline sales shops and online

        websites. So, where does the consumer shop from? It could be jewelry, it could be vegetables, it could be
        apparel, it could be watches, it could be mobile.
               So, does the consumer shop in closing stores, in which case ambiance becomes important, in which

        case variety becomes very important, in which case the service becomes very important or does he or she
        shop in a discount shop.

               How often does he make use of discount shop? Does the discount shopping have an impact on the
        brand equity if the same brand is available in the discount shop or in the brick and mortar shop or on the
        offline website? For example, online websites trade several kinds of brands, which are also available in

        discount shops. So, how should the brand try to maintain consistent association among the consumers of
        offline shopping and online shopping is one of the challenges, which confront a marketeer today.

               For example, if a consumer is shopping with respect to malls, the competitive brands may also be
        there. So, what kind of influence do the competitors have with respect to the consumer when the consumer
        shops in a mall? Is it going to be different from the consumer's memory when he's not frequently shopping in

        the mall?
               For example, if the consumer does not shop in the mall, he may be, he or she may be using in his
        internal memory to compare brands whereas if the consumer is a frequent shopper with respect to malls,

        then he would do a real-time comparison with the brands and these do impact his selection of the brand.

              V. CONSUMER RECEPTIVITY TO A NEW PRODUCT


               Let us discuss other aspects related to the receptivity of new products and product trails with respect

        to the consumer segment.
               For example, if coffee bags are introduced, would the consumer be interested in trying it out. What
        about the past experience of brands? Would the consumer be satisfied with the past experience? or despite

        being satisfied with the experience, would the consumer want to try out a new brand because the new brand
        is updated. What about the loyalty patterns? Several brands today have an exclusive club for a loyalty, and

        these loyalty clubs have a lot of privileges. So, what kind of privileges should be given to the loyal consumers?
                                                                                                              65]]></page><page Index="267"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY

        How should they be differentiated from other consumers? It has to be noted that there cannot be feeling of
        discrimination between the loyal consumers and the regular consumers and at the same time, the loyal
        consumers need to be rewarded.

                  What about the consumer's tendency to use credit cards? Does the consumer spend more while
        he or she uses a credit card in a particular ambiance? Is there instant gratification with respect to the selection
        of products and brands. For example, apparel. For example, certain kinds of groceries. So, these are some

        of the other aspects that needs to be understood while focusing on the receptivity of the consumer.
        Conclusion
                  I would like to conclude this module with a few suggestions with respect to learning consumer

        behavior. Please note that consumer behavior cannot be learned in isolation. Consumer behavior requires
        certain amount of prerequisites from basic marketing. For instance, when you want to apply perception to a

        host of offerings in the product line, a watch brand could have a product line, different kinds of watches with
        different designs at different price points. When we talk about the usage of perception, we talk about a
        concept like just noticeable difference. In order to appreciate the nuances of consumer behavior, you need

        to  know  the  basics  of  marketing.  Unless  you  know  what  a  product  line  management  is,  it's  difficult  to
        appreciate the nuances of perception, which are applied to product line management. So, my suggestion is

        learn theory and learn marketing principles as the basic course.
                  The second aspect is to associate theory with your own environment. There are multitude of ways
        in which this could be done. There are multitude of scenarios, there are multitude of tools that can be applied.

        This is something which comes only by practice.
                  The  third  aspect  is,  trying  to  have  rigor  with  relevance.  There  is  one  school  of  thought  that
        academics is far remote from practical realities. And this is completely misleading in the present-day context.

        In fact, one gets ideas only from academics, and at the same time, the academics does not mean that
        everything is practicable. So how do you have a balance between their marketing realities and the academic
        theories? You will have to have rigor with relevance.

                  Finally,  consumer  behavior  needs  to  be  synergized  with  brand  management  or  advertising  or
        retailing or even customer relationships management. I do hope that you had a good understanding of the

        basic  course  on  behavioral  dimensions  on  marketing management. This  is  a  basic  course  because  this
        domain is an ocean with a plethora of possibilities to learn and this is just an introductory course with the
        objective of introducing you to certain behavioral concepts. All the best.

               WEEK 1

               Lesson 1:  Introduction to Microeconomics – How People Make
               Decisions

               Learning Outcomes:
               After the completion of the module, you should be able to:

               1.  State the importance of microeconomics and the reason of its study

               2.  Explain the ten principles of microeconomics


               Overview:

               In our first lesson, we will learn the reason and the importance of the study of microeconomics.

               Why is it important to know?  Every day people are faced with decisions.  You have studied
               from your senior high school the meaning of Economics.  Economics is our basic study.  First,
               let us review what is Economics?

               Economics is a study of how individuals, firms, and government MAKE CHOICES under the
               CONDITION OF SCARCE RESOURCES.

               By looking at the definition, people, firm and government make choices under scarce resources
               (what are the resources here? Do you know? Let us define first the terms one by one.
               Remember this is only a review.

               SCARCITY – situation in which people cannot have everything that they want because of limited
               resources.

               RESOURCES – most basic elements that people use to produce the goods and services they
               want

               MAKING CHOICES – means selecting one over the other

               TRADE-OFF – situation in which they have to choose between two things (or activities) that
               cannot be had (or done) at the same time

               The word economy comes from the Greek word oikonomos, which means “one who manages
               the household.”  At first this origin looks different, but actually, households and economies have
               much in common.

               Everyday  our  households  face  decisions,  such  as, Who  is  going  to  wash  the  clothes? Who
               cooks the dinner? Who is going to be sent to a private school?  In short, the household must



                                                              7]]></page><page Index="277"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY             Department of Management
                        Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus  BMGT21: Basic Microeconomics


               allocate its scarce resources among its various members, taking into account each member’s
               abilities, efforts, and desires.

               Like  a household, a society  faces many decisions.  A society must find some way to decide
               what jobs will be done and who will do them.  It needs some people to grow food, other people
               to  make  clothing,  and  still  others  to  design  computer  software.    Once  society  has  allocated
               people  (as  well  as  land,  buildings,  and  machines)  to  various  jobs,  it  must  also  allocate  the
               output of goods and services they produce. It must decide who will eat the beef and who will eat
               the fishes.

               The  proper  management  of  society’s  resources  is  important  because  resources  are  scarce.
               Scarcity means that society has limited resources and therefore cannot produce all the goods
               and people wish to have.  Just like households cannot get everything they wish to have or the
               standard of living they want.

               Economics is the study of how society manages its scarce resources.  In this lesson, we will
               study the Ten Principles of Economics so we will fully understand why and how people make
               decisions.


               We will be using the Principles of Microeconomics by N. Gregory Mankiw, it can be downloaded
               through the net. I prefer to use this  book  as  our reference for I find it  easier  and simpler to
               understand.  For your further study, you can always refer to this book.  Let us now begin our
               discussion.


               DISCUSSION:

               Principle 1: People Face Trade-offs

               We oftentimes hear the saying, “There is no such thing as a free lunch.”  There is much truth to
               this saying.  To get one thing that we like, we usually have to give up another thing that we like.
               Making decisions requires trading off one goal against another.  Consider yourself, on how you
               allocate your valuable time.  You can spend all your time studying microeconomics or you can
               divide your time to all your subjects but for every hour you study microeconomics, you are giving
               up that hour you could have spent to other subjects. And for every hour you spend studying, you
               have given up the time you could have played mobile legends or napping or watching TV. In our
               society,  the  more  our  government  spends  for  national  defense  to  protect  us  from  foreign
               aggressors, the lesser it could spend on for our national health protection.  Nowadays, during
               the pandemic, our government does the other way, it spends more on the health protection of
               the people due to the virus COVID-19, so the budget allocated for new firearms and for  our
               national defense has to be put aside for the meantime.


               Another  trade-off  society  faces  is  between  efficiency  and  equality.    Efficiency  means  that
               society is getting the maximum benefits from its scarce resources.  Equality means that those

                                                              8]]></page><page Index="278"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY             Department of Management
                        Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus  BMGT21: Basic Microeconomics


               benefits are distributed uniformly among society’s members.  In other words, efficiency refers to
               the size of the economic pie, and equality refers to how the pie is divided into individual slices.



               Recognizing that people face trade-offs does not by itself tell us what decisions they or should
               make.  Society should not stop protecting environment just because environmental regulations
               reduce our material standard of living.  Our study of economics starts by acknowledging life’s
               trade-offs.

               PRINCIPLE 2:  THE COST OF SOMETHING IS WHAT YOU GIVE UP TO GET IT

               Because people face trade-offs, making decisions requires comparing the costs and benefits of
               alternative courses of action.  In many cases, the cost of an action is not as obvious as it might
               first appear.


               Consider the decision to go to college.   The main benefits  are intellectual  enrichment and  a
               lifetime of better job opportunities.  But what are the costs?  The money you spent on books,
               room, and board.  Yet this total does not truly represent what you give up to spend a year in
               college.  There are two problems with this calculation.  First, it includes some things that are not
               really costs of going to college.  Even if you quit school, you need a place to sleep and food to
               eat.    Room  and  board  are  costs  of  going  to  college  only  to  the  extent  that  they  are  more
               expensive at college than elsewhere. Second, this calculation ignores the largest cost of going
               to college – your time.  When you spend a year listening to lectures, reading textbooks, and
               writing papers, you cannot spend that time working at a job.  For some students, the earnings
               given up to attend school are the largest single cost of their education.  The opportunity cost
               of an item is what you give up to get that item.  When making any decision, decision makers
               should  be  aware  of  the  opportunity  costs  that  accompany  each  possible  action.    College
               athletes who can earn millions if they drop out of school and play professional sports are well
               aware  that  their  opportunity  cost  of  college  is  very  high.    It  is  not  surprising  that  they  often
               decide that the benefit is not worth the cost.

               PRINCIPLE 3:  RATIONALE PEOPLE THINK AT THE MARGIN

               Economists  normally  assume  that  people  are  rational.    Rational  people  systematically  and
               purposefully do the best they can to achieve their objectives, given the available opportunities.
               As you study economics, you will encounter firms that they decide how many workers to hire
               and  how  much  of  their  product  to  manufacture  and  sell  to  maximize  profits.    You  will  also
               encounter  individuals  who  decide  how  much  time  to  spend  working  and  what  goods  and
               services to buy with the resulting income to achieve the highest possible level of satisfaction.
               When exams rolls around, your decision is not between blowing them off or studying 24 hours a
               day but whether to spend extra hour reviewing your notes instead of watching TV.  Economists
               use the term marginal changes to describe small incremental adjustments to an existing plan of
               action.  Keep in mind that margin means “edge”, so marginal changes are adjustments around
               the edges of what you are doing.  Rational people often make decisions by comparing marginal
               benefits and marginal costs.

               Marginal decision making can help explain some otherwise puzzling economic phenomena.

               Here is classic question:  Why is water so cheap, while diamonds are so expensive?  Humans
               need water to survive, while diamonds are unnecessary; but for some reason, people are willing
               to  pay  much  more  for  a  diamond  than  for  a  cup  of  water.    The  reason  is  that  a  person’s
               willingness to pay for any good is based on the marginal benefit that an extra unit of the good



                                                             10]]></page><page Index="280"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY             Department of Management
                        Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus  BMGT21: Basic Microeconomics


               would yield.  The marginal benefit, in turn, depends on how may units a person already has.
               Water is essential, but the marginal benefit of an extra cup is small because water is plentiful.

               By  contrast,  no  one  needs  diamonds  to  survive,  but  because  diamonds  are  so  rare,  people
               consider the marginal benefit of an extra diamond to be large.  A rational decision maker takes
               an  action  if  and  only  if  the  marginal  benefit  of  the  action  exceeds  the  marginal  cost.    The
               principle can explain why people are willing to pay more for diamonds than for water.  It can
               take some time to get used of the logic of marginal thinking but the study of economics will give
               you ample opportunity to practice.

               PRINCIPLE 4:  PEOPLE RESPOND TO INCENTIVES

               An incentive is something that induces a person to act, such as the prospect of a punishment or
               a  reward.    Because  rational  people  make  decisions  by  comparing  costs  and  benefits,  they
               respond to incentives.  You will see that incentives play a central role in the study of economics.
               Incentives are crucial to analyzing how markets work.

               For example, when the price of an apple rises, people decide to eat fewer apples.  At the same
               time, apple orchards decide to hire more workers and harvest more apples.  In other words, a
               higher price in market provides  an incentive for buyers to consume less  and  an incentive for
               sellers to produce more.  As we will see, the influence of prices on the behaviors of consumers
               and produces is crucial for how a market economy allocates scarce resources.

               Public policy makers should never forget about incentives:  many policies change the costs
               or benefits that people face and, therefore, alter their behavior.  A tax on gasoline, for instance,
               encourages people to drive smaller, more fuel-efficient cars. That is one reason people drive
               smaller  cars  in  Europe,  where  gasoline  taxes  are  high,  than  in  the  United  States,  where
               gasoline  taxes  are  low.  A  gasoline  tax  also  encourages  people  to  carpool,  take  public
               transportation, and live closer to where they work. If the tax were larger, more people would be
               driving hybrid cars, and if it were large enough, they would switch to electric cars.

               When policymakers fail to consider how their policies affect incentives, they often end up
               with unintended consequences.

               For example, consider public policy regarding auto safety. Today, all cars have seat belts, but
               this  was  not  true  50  years  ago.  In  the  1960s,  Ralph  Nader’s  book  Unsafe  at  Any  Speed
               generated much public concern over auto safety. Congress responded with laws requiring seat
               belts as standard equipment on new cars.

               How does a seat belt law affect auto safety? The direct effect is obvious: When a person wears
               a seat belt, the probability of surviving an auto accident rises. But that’s not the end of the story
               because the law also affects behavior by altering incentives. The relevant behavior here is the
               speed  and  care  with  which  drivers  operate  their  cars.  Driving  slowly  and  carefully  is  costly
               because it uses the driver’s time and energy. When deciding how safely to drive, rational people


                                                             11]]></page><page Index="281"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY             Department of Management

               compare, perhaps unconsciously, the marginal benefit from safer driving to the marginal cost.
               As result, they drive more slowly and carefully when the benefit of increased safety is high. For
               example, when road conditions are icy, people drive more attentively and at lower speeds than
               they do when road conditions  are clear. Consider how a seat belt law alters  a driver’s cost–
               benefit calculation. Seat belts make accidents less costly because they reduce the likelihood of
               injury  or  death.    In  other  words,  seat  belts  reduce  the  benefits  of  slow  and  careful  driving.
               People respond to seat belts as they would to an improvement in road conditions—by driving
               faster and less carefully. The result of a seat belt law, therefore, is a larger number of accidents.
               The decline in safe driving has a clear, adverse impact on pedestrians, who are more likely to
               find themselves in an accident but (unlike the drivers) don’t have the benefit of added protection.

               At first, this discussion of incentives and seat belts might seem like idle speculation. Yet in a
               classic 1975 study, economist Sam Peltzman argued that auto-safety laws have had many of
               these  effects.  According  to  Peltzman’s  evidence,  these  laws  produce  both  fewer  deaths  per
               accident and more accidents. He concluded that the net result is little change in the number of
               driver deaths and an increase in the number of pedestrian deaths. Peltzman’s analysis of auto
               safety is an offbeat example of the general principle that people respond to incentives. When
               analyzing  any  policy,  we must  consider  not  only  the  direct  effects  but  also  the  less  obvious
               indirect effects that work through incentives. If the policy changes incentives, it will cause people
               to alter their behavior.


               SUMMARY:

               The  fundamental  lessons  about  individual  decision  making  are  that  people  face  trade-offs
               among  alternative  goals,  that  the  cost  of  any  action  is  measured  in  terms  of  forgone
               opportunities, that rational people make decisions by comparing marginal costs and marginal
               benefits, and that people change their behavior in response to the incentives they face.



               TERMINOLOGY TO REVIEW
               Economics - is the study of how society manages its scarce resources

               Scarcity - means that society has limited resources and therefore cannot produce all the goods
               and people wish to have

               Efficiency - society is getting the maximum benefits from its scarce resources

               Equality - means that those benefits are distributed uniformly among society’s members

               Trade-offs - situation in which they have to choose between two things (or activities) that
               cannot be had (or done) at the same time

               LESSON 2:  Introduction to Microeconomics – How People Interact

               Learning Outcomes:

               After the completion of the chapter, you should be able to:
               1.  State the importance of microeconomics and the reason of its study
               2.  Explain the principles of microeconomics on how people interact.

               Introduction:


               The first four principles discussed how individuals make decisions. As we go about our lives,
               many of our decisions affect not only ourselves but other people as well. The next three
               principles concern how people interact with one another.

               PRINCIPLE 5: TRADE CAN MAKE EVERYONE BETTER OFF

               You have probably heard on the news that the Japanese and American are competitors in the
               world  economy.  In  some  ways,  this  is  true  because  American  and  Japanese  firms  produce
               many of the same goods. Ford and Toyota compete for the same customers in the market for
               automobiles. Apple and Sony compete for the same customers in the market for digEital music
               players.  Samsung and Apple compete for the same customers in the market for mobile phones.

               Yet it is easy to be misled when thinking about competition among countries. Trade between the
               United States and Japan is not like a sports contest in which one side wins and the other side
               loses. In  fact, the opposite is true:  Trade between two countries can  make each country
               better off.

               To see why, consider how trade affects your family. When a member of your family looks for a
               job, he or she competes against members of other families who are looking for jobs. Families
               also compete against one another when they go shopping because each family wants to buy
               the best goods at the lowest prices. In a sense, each family in the economy is competing with all
               other families.
               Despite this competition, your family would not be better off isolating itself from all other families.
               If it did, your family would need to grow its own food, make its own clothes, and build its own
               home. Clearly, your family gains much from its ability to trade with others. Trade allows each
               person to specialize in the activities he or she does best, whether it is farming, sewing,
               or home building. By trading with others, people can buy a greater variety of goods and
               services at lower cost.





                                                             14]]></page><page Index="284"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY             Department of Management

               Countries as well as families benefit from the ability to trade with one another.  Trade allows
               countries to specialize in what they do best and to enjoy a greater variety of goods and
               services.  The  Japanese,  as  well  as  the  French  and  the  Egyptians  and  the  Brazilians,  are
               Americans partners in the world economy as they are their competitors.

               PRINCIPLE  6:    MARKETS  ARE  USUALLY  A  GOOD  WAY  TO  ORGANIZE
               ECONOMIC ACTIVITY

               The collapse of communism in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe in the 1980s may be the
               most important change in the world during the past half century.

               Communist countries worked on the premise that government officials were in the best position
               to allocate the economy’s scarce resources. These central planners decided what goods and
               services  were  produced,  how much was  produced,  and  who  produced  and  consumed  these
               goods  and  services. The theory behind central planning was that  only the government could
               organize  economic activity in a way that promoted  economic well-being  for the country  as  a
               whole.

               Most countries that once had centrally planned economies have abandoned the system and are
               instead developing market economies. In a market economy, the decisions of a central planner
               are replaced by the decisions of millions of firms and households. Firms decide whom to hire
               and  what  to  make.  Households  decide  which  firms  to  work  for  and  what  to  buy  with  their
               incomes. These firms and households interact in the marketplace, where prices and self-interest
               guide their decisions.

               At first glance, the success of market economies is puzzling. In a market economy, no one is
               looking  out  for  the  economic  well-being  of  society  as  a  whole.  Free  markets  contain  many
               buyers and sellers of numerous goods and services, and all of them are interested primarily in
               their  own  well-being.  Yet  despite  decentralized  decision  making  and  self-interested  decision
               makers, market economies have proven remarkably successful in organizing economic activity
               to promote overall economic well-being.

               In his 1776 book An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations, economist
               Adam Smith made  the  most  famous  observation  in  all  of  economics:  Households  and  firms
               interacting  in  markets  act  as  if  they  are  guided  by  an  “invisible  hand”  that  leads  them  to
               desirable market outcomes. One of our goals in this study is to understand how this invisible
               hand works its magic.

               As you study economics, you will learn that prices are the instrument with which the invisible
               hand directs economic activity. In any market, buyers look at the price when determining how
               much to demand, and sellers look at the price when deciding how much to supply. As a result of
               the decisions that buyers and sellers make, market prices reflect both the value of a good to
               society and the cost to society of making the good. Smith’s great insight was that prices adjust



                                                             15]]></page><page Index="285"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY             Department of Management
                        Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus  BMGT21: Basic Microeconomics


               to guide these individual buyers and sellers to reach outcomes that, in many cases, maximize
               the well-being of society as a whole.

               Smith’s insight has an important corollary: When the government prevents prices from adjusting
               naturally  to  supply  and  demand,  it  impedes  the  invisible  hand’s  ability  to  coordinate  the
               decisions of the households and firms that make up the economy. This corollary explains why
               taxes adversely affect the allocation of resources, for they distort prices and thus the decisions
               of households and firms. It also explains the great harm caused by policies that directly control
               prices, such as rent control. And it explains the failure of communism. In Communist countries,
               prices were not determined in the marketplace but were dictated by central planners.

               These  planners  lacked  the  necessary  information  about  consumers’  tastes  and  producers’
               costs, which in a market economy are reflected in prices. Central planners failed because they
               tried  to  run  the  economy  with  one  hand  tied  behind  their  backs—the  invisible  hand  of  the
               marketplace.

               PRINCIPLE 7:  GOVERNMENT CAN SOMETIMES IMPROVE MARKET OUTCOMES

               If the invisible hand of the market is so great, why do we need government? One purpose of
               studying economics is to refine your view about the proper role and scope of government policy.

               One  reason  we  need  government  is  that  the  invisible  hand  can  work  its  magic  only  if  the
               government enforces the rules and maintains the institutions that are key to a market
               economy. Most important, market economies need institutions to enforce  property rights so
               individuals can own and control scarce resources.

               A farmer won’t grow food if he expects his crop to be stolen; a restaurant won’t serve meals
               unless  it  is  assured  that  customers  will  pay  before  they  leave;  and  a  music  company  won’t
               produce CDs if too many potential customers avoid paying

               (property rights
               the ability of an individual
               to own and exercise
               control over scarce
               resources)

               by making illegal copies. We all rely on government-provided police and courts to enforce our
               rights over the things we produce—and the invisible hand counts on our ability to enforce our
               rights.
               Yet there is another reason we need government: The invisible hand is powerful, but it is not
               omnipotent. There  are two broad reasons for a government to intervene  in the  economy and
               change the allocation of resources that people would choose on their own: to promote efficiency
               or  to  promote  equality.  That  is,  most  policies  aim  either  to  enlarge  the  economic  pie  or  to
               change how the pie is divided.




                                                             16]]></page><page Index="286"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY             Department of Management
                        Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus  BMGT21: Basic Microeconomics


               Consider first the goal of efficiency. Although the invisible hand usually leads markets to allocate
               resources to maximize the size of the economic pie, this is not always the case. Economists use
               the term market failure to refer to a situation in which the market on its own fails to produce an
               efficient allocation of resources.

               As we will see, one possible cause of market failure is an  externality, which is the impact of
               one person’s actions on the well-being of a bystander. The classic example of an externality is
               pollution. Another possible cause of market failure is market power, which refers to the ability
               of a single person (or small group) to unduly influence market prices. For example, if everyone
               in  town  needs  water  but  there  is  only  one  well,  the  owner  of  the  well  is  not  subject  to  the
               rigorous competition with which the invisible hand normally keeps self-interest in check. In the
               presence  of  externalities  or  market  power,  well-designed  public  policy  can  enhance
               economic efficiency.

               Now consider the goal of equality. Even when the invisible hand is yielding efficient outcomes, it
               can nonetheless leave sizable disparities in economic wellbeing.

               A market economy rewards people according to their ability to produce things that other people
               are willing to pay for. The world’s best basketball player earns more than the world’s best chess
               player  simply  because  people  are  willing  to  pay  more  to  watch  basketball  than  chess.  The
               invisible hand does not ensure that everyone has sufficient food, decent clothing, and adequate
               healthcare. This inequality may, depending on one’s political philosophy, call for government
               intervention. In practice, many public policies, such as the income tax and the welfare
               system, aim to achieve a more equal distribution of economic well-being.

               To say that the government can improve on market outcomes at times does not mean that it
               always will. Public policy is made not by angels but by a political process that is far from perfect.
               Sometimes policies are designed simply to reward the politically powerful. Sometimes they are
               made by well-intentioned leaders who are not fully informed. As you study economics, you
               will  become  a  better  judge  of  when  a  government  policy  is  justifiable  because  it
               promotes efficiency or equality and when it is not.

               SUMMARY:

               The fundamental lessons about interactions among people are that trade and interdependence
               can  be  mutually  beneficial,  that  markets  are  usually  a  good  way  of  coordinating  economic
               activity among people, and that the government can potentially improve  market outcomes by
               remedying a market failure or by promoting greater economic equality.

               LESSON 3:  Introduction to Microeconomics – How the Economy as a Whole
               Works

               Learning Outcomes:

               After the completion of the chapter, students should be able to:

               1.  State the importance of microeconomics and the reason of its study


               2.  Explain the principles of microeconomics on how the economy as a whole works.


               Overview

               We started our discussion on how people make decision then how people interact and in these
               last  three  principles  how  the  economy  works  as  a  whole.    These  ten  principles  are  what
               economy is made  of.  By studying these ten principles, we will fully understand the world in
               which we live in.

               PRINCIPLE 8: A COUNTRY’S STANDARD OF LIVING  DEPENDS ON ITS ABILITY
               TO PRODUCE GOODS AND SERVICES

               The  differences  in  living  standards  around  the  world  are  staggering.  In  2006,  the  average
               American  had  an  income  of  about  $44,260.  In the  same  year,  the  average  Mexican  earned
               $11,410,  and  the  average  Nigerian  earned  $1,050.  Not  surprisingly,  this  large  variation  in
               average income is reflected in various measures of the quality of life. Citizens of high-income
               countries have more TV sets, more cars, better nutrition, better healthcare,  and  a longer life
               expectancy than citizens of low-income countries.

               Changes  in  living  standards  over  time  are  also  large.  In  the  United  States,  incomes  have
               historically grown about 2 percent per year (after adjusting for changes in the cost of living). At
               this rate, average income doubles every 35 years. Over the past century, average income has
               risen about eightfold.

               What explains these large differences in living standards among countries and over time? The
               answer is surprisingly simple. Almost all variation in living standards is attributable to differences
               in countries’ productivity—that is, the amount of goods and services produced from each unit
               of labor input. In nations where workers can produce a large quantity of goods and services per
               unit  of  time, most  people  enjoy  a  high  standard  of  living;  in  nations  where  workers  are  less
               productive,  most  people  endure  a  more  meager  existence.  Similarly,  the  growth  rate  of  a
               nation’s productivity determines the growth rate of its average income.






                                                             19]]></page><page Index="289"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY             Department of Management
                        Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus  BMGT21: Basic Microeconomics


               The  fundamental  relationship  between  productivity  and  living  standards  is  simple,  but  its
               implications are far-reaching. If productivity is the primary determinant of living standards, other
               explanations must be of secondary importance.

               For example, it might be tempting to credit labor unions or minimum-wage laws for the rise in
               living  standards  of  American  workers  over  the  past  century.  Yet  the  real  hero  of  American
               workers is their rising productivity. As another example, some commentators have claimed that
               increased  competition  from  Japan  and  other  countries  explained  the  slow  growth  in  U.S.
               incomes during the 1970s and 1980s. Yet the real villain was not competition from abroad but
               flagging productivity growth in the United States.

               The relationship between productivity and living standards  also has profound implications for
               public policy. When thinking about how any policy will affect living standards, the key question is
               how  it  will  affect  our  ability  to  produce  goods  and  services.  To  boost  living  standards,
               policymakers need to raise productivity by ensuring that workers are well educated, have
               the tools needed to produce goods and services, and have access to the best available
               technology.

               PRINCIPLE  9:    PRICES  RISE  WHEN  THE  GOVERNMENT  PRINTS  TOO  MUCH
               MONEY

               In January 1921, a daily newspaper in Germany cost 0.30 marks. Less than two years later, in
               November 1922, the same newspaper cost 70,000,000 marks. All other prices in the economy
               rose  by  similar  amounts.  This  episode  is  one  of  history’s  most  spectacular  examples  of
               inflation, an increase in the overall level of prices in the economy.

               Although the United States has never experienced inflation even close to that in Germany in the
               1920s, inflation has at times been an economic problem. During the 1970s, for instance, when
               the  overall  level  of  prices  more  than  doubled,  President  Gerald  Ford  called  inflation  “public
               enemy number one.” By contrast, inflation in the first decade of the 21st century has run about
               21⁄2 percent per year; at this rate, it would take almost 30 years for prices to double. Because
               high  inflation  imposes  various  costs  on  society,  keeping  inflation  at  a  low  level  is  a  goal  of
               economic policymakers around the world.

               What  causes  inflation?  In  almost  all  cases  of  large  or  persistent  inflation,  the  culprit  is
               growth  in  the  quantity  of  money.  When  a  government  creates  large  quantities  of  the
               nation’s money, the value of the money falls. In Germany in the early 1920s, when prices
               were  on  average  tripling  every  month,  the  quantity  of  money  was  also  tripling  every  month.
               Although less dramatic, the economic history of the United States points to a similar conclusion:
               The high inflation of the 1970s was associated with rapid growth in the quantity of money, and
               the low inflation of more recent experience was associated with slow growth in the quantity of
               money.

               PRINCIPLE 10:  SOCIETY FACES SHORT-RUN TRADE-OFF BETWEEN INFLATION
               AND UNEMPLOYMENT

               Although a higher level of prices is, in the long run, the primary effect of increasing the quantity
               of money, the short-run story is more complex and controversial. Most economists describe the
               short-run effects of monetary injections as follows:

               • Increasing the amount of money in the economy stimulates the overall level of spending and
               thus the demand for goods and services.
               • Higher demand may over time cause firms to raise their prices, but in the meantime, it also
               encourages them to hire more workers and produce a larger quantity of goods and services.
               • More hiring means lower unemployment.

               This line of reasoning leads to one final economy-wide trade-off: a short-run tradeoff between
               inflation and unemployment. Although some economists still question these ideas, most accept
               that society faces a short-run trade-off between inflation and unemployment. This simply means
               that, over a period of a year or two, many economic policies push inflation and unemployment in
               opposite  directions.  Policymakers  face  this  trade-off  regardless  of  whether  inflation  and
               unemployment both start out at high levels (as they were in the early 1980s), at low levels (as
               they were in the late 1990s), or someplace in between. This short-run trade-off plays a key role
               in the analysis of the business cycle—the irregular and largely unpredictable fluctuations
               in  economic  activity,  as  measured  by  the  production  of  goods  and  services  or  the
               number of people employed.

               Policymakers  can  exploit  the  short-run  trade-off  between  inflation  and  unemployment  using
               various  policy  instruments.  By  changing  the  amount  that  the  government  spends,  the
               amount  it  taxes,  and  the  amount  of  money  it  prints,  policymakers  can  influence  the
               overall  demand  for  goods  and  services.  Changes  in  demand  in  turn  influence  the
               combination  of  inflation  and  unemployment  that  the  economy  experiences  in  the  short-run.
               Because these instruments of  economic policy are potentially so powerful, how policymakers
               should use these instruments to control the economy, if at all, is a subject of continuing debate.


               CONCLUSION:

               The fundamental lessons  about the  economy as  a whole  are that productivity is the ultimate
               source  of  living  standards,  that  growth  in  the  quantity  of  money  is  the  ultimate  source  of
               inflation, and that society faces a short-run trade-off between inflation and unemployment.

               After studying the ten principles of economics, you fully understand now what economics is all
               about and in the succeeding lessons some insights and ideas of people, market, and economies
               are based on these principles.  The field of economics is based on a few big ideas that can be
               applied in many different situations.

               WEEK 4

               Lesson: ECONOMIC MODELS

               Learning Outcomes:

               After the completion of the chapter, you should be able to:

               1.  Explain the importance of economic model in economic analysis

               2.  Draw a circular model for every given situation

               Overview:

                       High  school  biology  teachers  teach  basic  anatomy with  plastic  replicas  of  the  human
               body. These models have all the major organs: the heart, the liver, the kidneys, and so on. The
               models allow teachers to show their students very simply how the important parts of the body fit
               together.  Because  these  plastic  models  are  stylized  and  omit  many  details,  no  one  would
               mistake one of them for a real person. Despite this lack of realism—studying these models is
               useful for learning how the human body works.

                       Economists  also  use  models  to  learn  about  the  world,  but  instead  of  being  made  of
               plastic,  they  are  most  often  composed  of  diagrams  and  equations.  Like  a  biology  teacher’s
               plastic model, economic models omit many details to  allow us to see what is truly important.
               Just as the biology teacher’s model does not include all the body’s muscles and capillaries, an
               economist’s  model  does  not  include  every  feature  of  the  economy.    Models  are  built  with
               assumptions.  All models—in physics, biology, and economics— simplify reality to improve our
               understanding of it.

               Discussion:
               OUR FIRST MODEL: THE CIRCULAR-FLOW DIAGRAM

                       The economy consists of millions of people engaged in many activities—buying, selling,
               working, hiring, manufacturing, and so on. To understand how the economy works, we must find
               some way to simplify our thinking about all these activities. In other words, we need a model
               that  explains,  in  general  terms,  how  the  economy  is  organized  and  how  participants  in  the
               economy interact with one another.



                       Figure 1 presents a visual model of the economy called a circular-flow diagram. In this
               model,  the  economy  is  simplified  to  include  only  two  types  of  decision  makers—firms  and
               households. Firms produce goods and services using inputs, such as labor, land, and capital




                                                             23]]></page><page Index="293"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY             Department of Management

               (buildings and machines). These inputs are called the factors of production. Households own
               the factors of production and consume all the goods and services that the firms produce.

                       Households and firms interact in two types of markets. In the  markets for goods and
               services, households are buyers, and firms are sellers. In particular, households buy the output
               of  goods  and  services  that  firms  produce.  In  the  markets  for  the  factors  of  production,
               households are sellers, and firms are buyers. In these markets, households provide the inputs
               that firms use to produce goods and services. The circular-flow diagram offers a simple way of
               organizing the economic transactions that occur between households and firms in the economy.

                       The  two  loops  of  the  circular-flow  diagram  are  distinct  but  related.  The  inner  loop
               represents the flows of inputs and outputs. The households sell the use of their labor, land, and
               capital to the firms in the markets for the factors of production. The firms then use these factors
               to produce goods and services, which in turn are sold to households in the markets for goods
               and services. The outer loop of the diagram represents the corresponding flow of dollars. The
               households spend money to buy goods and services from the firms. The firms use some of the
               revenue  from  these  sales  to  pay  for  the  factors  of  production,  such  as  the  wages  of  their
               workers.  What’s  left  is  the  profit  of  the  firm  owners,  who  themselves  are  members  of
               households.

               Example:

                       Let’s take a tour of the circular flow by following a dollar bill as it makes its way from
               person to person through the economy. Imagine that the dollar begins at a household, say, in
               your wallet. If you want to buy  a cup of coffee, you take the dollar to  one  of the  economy’s
               markets for goods and services, such as your local



               Starbucks coffee shop. There you spend it on your favorite drink. When the dollar moves into
               the  Starbucks  cash  register,  it  becomes  revenue  for  the  firm.  The  dollar  doesn’t  stay  at
               Starbucks for long, however, because the firm uses it to buy inputs in the markets for the factors
               of production. Starbucks might use the dollar to pay rent to its landlord for the space it occupies
               or  to  pay  the  wages  of  its  workers.  In  either  case,  the  dollar  enters  the  income  of  some
               household  and,  once  again,  is  back  in  someone’s  wallet.  At  that  point,  the  story  of  the
               economy’s circular flow starts once again.

                       The circular-flow diagram in Figure 1 is one simple model of the economy. It dispenses
               with details that, for some purposes, are significant. A more complex and realistic circular-flow
               model would include, for instance, the roles  of government and international trade. (Some of
               that dollar you gave to Starbucks might be used to pay taxes and or to buy coffee beans from a
               farmer in Brazil.) Yet these details are not crucial for a basic understanding of how the economy
               is organized. Because of its simplicity, this circular-flow diagram is useful to keep in mind when
               thinking about how the pieces of the economy fit together.

               The Circular Flow
               This diagram is a schematic representation of the organization of the economy. Decisions are
               made by households and firms. Households and firms interact in the markets for goods and
               services (where households are buyers and firms are sellers) and in the markets for the factors
               of  production  (where  firms  are  buyers  and  households  are  sellers).  The  outer  set  of  arrows
               shows the flow of dollars, and the inner set of arrows shows the corresponding flow of inputs
               and outputs.

               OUR SECOND MODEL: THE PRODUCTION POSSIBILITIES FRONTIER

                       Most  economic  models,  unlike  the  circular-flow  diagram,  are  built  using  the  tools  of
               mathematics.  Here  we  use  one  of  the  simplest  such  models,  called  the  production
               possibilities frontier, to illustrate some basic economic ideas.

                       Although  real  economies  produce  thousands  of  goods  and  services,  let’s  assume  an
               economy that produces only two goods—cars and computers. Together, the car industry and
               the computer industry use all of the economy’s factors of production.

                       The production possibilities frontier is a graph that shows the various combinations of
               output—in this case, cars  and computers—that the economy can  possibly produce given the
               available factors  of production  and the available production technology that firms use to turn
               these factors into output.

                       Figure 2 shows this economy’s production possibilities frontier. If the economy uses all
               its  resources  in  the  car  industry,  it  produces  1,000  cars  and  no  computers.  If  it  uses  all  its
               resources  in  the  computer  industry,  it  produces  3,000  computers  and  no  cars.  The  two
               endpoints of the production possibilities frontier represent these extreme possibilities.

                       More  likely,  the  economy  divides  its  resources  between  the  two  industries,  and  this
               yields other points on the production possibilities frontier. For example, it can produce 600 cars
               and  2,200  computers,  shown  in  the  figure  by  point  A.  Or,  by moving  some  of  the  factors  of
               production to the car industry from the computer industry, the economy can produce 700 cars
               and 2,000 computers, represented by point B.

                       Because resources are scarce, not every conceivable outcome is feasible. For example,
               no  matter  how  resources  are  allocated  between  the  two  industries,  the  economy  cannot
               produce  the  amount  of  cars  and  computers  represented  by  point  C.  Given  the  technology
               available  for  manufacturing cars  and  computers,  the  economy  does  not  have  enough  of  the
               factors of production to support that level of output. With the resources it has, the economy can
               produce at any point on or inside the production possibilities frontier, but it cannot produce at
               points outside the frontier.

                       An  outcome  is  said  to  be  efficient  if  the  economy  is  getting  all  it  can  from  the
               scarce resources it has available. Points on (rather than inside) the production possibilities
               frontier represent efficient levels of production. When the economy is producing at such a point,
               say point A, there is no way to produce more of one good without producing less of the other.
               Point D represents an inefficient outcome.

                       For some reason, perhaps widespread unemployment, the economy is producing less
               than  it  could  from  the  resources  it  has  available:  It  is  producing  only  300  cars  and  1,000
               computers.  If  the  source  of  the  inefficiency  is  eliminated,  the  economy  can  increase  its
               production  of  both  goods.  For  example,  if  the  economy  moves  from  point  D  to  point  A,  its
               production of cars increases from 300 to 600, and its production of computers increases from
               1,000 to 2,200.

                       One of the Ten Principles of Economics discussed in Chapter 1 is that people face
               trade-offs.  The  production  possibilities  frontier  shows  one  trade-off  that  society  faces.
               Once we have reached the efficient points on the frontier, the only way of getting more of
               one good is to get less of the other. When the economy moves from point A to point B, for
               instance,  society  produces  100  more  cars  but  at  the  expense  of  producing  200  fewer
               computers.

                       This trade-off helps us understand another of the Ten Principles of Economics: The cost
               of  something  is  what  you  give  up  to  get  it.  This  is  called  the  opportunity  cost.  The
               production possibilities frontier shows the opportunity cost of one good as measured in terms of
               the other good. When society moves from point A to point B, it gives up 200 computers to get
               100 additional cars. That is, at point A, the opportunity cost of 100 cars is 200 computers. Put
               another way, the opportunity cost of each car is two computers.

                       Notice that the opportunity cost of a car equals the slope of the production possibilities
               frontier. The opportunity cost of a car in terms of the number of computers is not constant in this
               economy  but  depends  on  how many  cars  and  computers  the  economy  is  producing.  This  is
               reflected in the shape of the production possibilities frontier.

                       Because  the  production  possibilities  frontier  in  Figure  2  is  bowed  outward,  the
               opportunity  cost  of  a  car  is  highest  when  the  economy  is  producing  many  cars  and  fewer
               computers, such as at point E, where the frontier is steep. When the economy is producing few
               cars and many computers, such as at point F, the frontier is flatter, and the opportunity cost of a
               car is lower.

                       Economists believe that production possibilities frontiers often have this bowed shape.
               When the economy is using most of its resources to make computers, such as at point F, the
               resources  best  suited  to  car  production,  such  as  skilled  autoworkers,  are  being  used  in  the
               computer industry. Because these workers probably aren’t very good at making computers, the
               economy won’t have to lose much computer production to increase car production by one unit.
               The opportunity cost of a car in terms of computers is small, and the frontier is relatively flat.

                       By contrast, when the economy is using most of its resources to make cars, such as at
               point E, the resources best suited to making cars are already in the car industry. Producing an
               additional  car  means  moving  some  of  the  best  computer  technicians  out  of  the  computer
               industry and making them autoworkers. As  a result, producing  an  additional car will mean  a
               substantial loss  of computer  output. The opportunity cost of  a car is high, and the  frontier is
               steep.

               The Production Possibilities Frontier
               The production possibilities frontier shows the combinations of output—in this case, cars and computers—that the
               economy can possibly produce. The economy can produce any combination on or inside the frontier. Points outside
               the frontier are not feasible given the economy’s resources

               This figure illustrates economic growth. Society can move production from a point on the old
               frontier to a point on the new frontier. Which point it chooses depends on its preferences for the
               two goods. In this example, society moves from point A to point G, enjoying more computers
               (2,300 instead of 2,200) and more cars (650 instead of 600).

               The production possibilities frontier simplifies a complex economy to highlight some basic but
               powerful ideas: scarcity, efficiency, trade-offs, opportunity cost, and economic growth. As you
               study economics, these ideas will recur in various  forms. The production possibilities frontier
               offers one simple way of thinking about them.

               MICROECONOMICS AND MACROECONOMICS

               Economics  is  also  studied  on  various  levels.  We  can  study  the  decisions  of  individual
               households and firms. Or we can study the interaction of households and firms in markets for
               specific goods and services. Or we can study the operation of the economy as a whole, which is
               the sum of the activities of all these decision makers in all these markets. The field of economics
               is traditionally divided into two broad subfields.

               Microeconomics  is  the  study  of  how  households  and  firms  make  decisions  and  how  they
               interact  in  specific markets.  Macroeconomics  is  the  study  of  economy  wide  phenomena.  A
               microeconomist might study the effects of rent control on housing in New York City, the impact

                                                             28]]></page><page Index="298"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY             Department of Management

               of foreign competition on the U.S. auto industry, or the effects of compulsory school attendance
               on workers’ earnings. A macroeconomist might study the effects of borrowing by the federal
               government,  the  changes  over  time  in  the  economy’s  rate  of  unemployment,  or  alternative
               policies to promote growth in national living standards.

               Microeconomics and macroeconomics are closely intertwined. Because changes in the overall
               economy  arise  from  the  decisions  of  millions  of  individuals,  it  is  impossible  to  understand
               macroeconomic  developments  without  considering  the  associated  microeconomic  decisions.
               For example, a macroeconomist might study the effect of a federal income tax cut on the overall
               production of goods and services. But to analyze this issue, he or she must consider how the
               tax cut affects the decisions of households about how much to spend on goods and services.

               Overview:


               When you walk into a store, you are confronted with thousands of goods that you might buy.
               Because  your  financial  resources  are  limited,  however,  you  cannot  buy  everything  that  you
               want. You therefore consider the prices of the various goods offered for sale and buy a bundle
               of goods that, given your resources, best suits your needs and desires.

               One of the Ten Principles of Economics discussed in Chapter 1 is that people face trade-offs.
               The  theory  of  consumer  choice  examines  the  trade-offs  that  people  face  in  their  role  as
               consumers. When a consumer buys more of one good, he can afford less of other goods. When
               he  spends  more  time  enjoying  leisure  and  less  time working,  he  has  lower  income  and  can
               afford less consumption. When he spends more of his income in the present and saves less of
               it, he must accept a lower level of consumption in the future. The theory of consumer choice
               examines  how  consumers  facing  these  trade-offs  make  decisions  and  how  they  respond  to
               changes in their environment.

               Discussion

               The Budget Constraint:  What the consumer can afford

               Most people would like to increase the quantity or quality of the goods they consume—to take
               longer vacations, drive fancier cars, or eat at better restaurants. People consume less than they
               desire because their spending is constrained, or limited, by their income. We begin our study of
               consumer choice by examining this link between income and spending.

               EXAMPLE:  To keep things simple, we examine the decision facing a consumer who buys
               only two goods: pizza and Pepsi. Of course, real people buy thousands of different kinds of
               goods. Assuming there are  only two goods greatly simplifies the problem without altering the
               basic insights about consumer choice.








                                                             32]]></page><page Index="302"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY             Department of Management
                        Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus  BMGT21: Basic Microeconomics


               We first consider how the consumer’s income constrains the amount he spends on pizza and
               Pepsi. Suppose the consumer has an income of $1,000 per month and he spends his entire
               income on pizza and Pepsi. The price of a pizza is $10, and the price of a pint of Pepsi is $2.

               The  table  in  Figure  1  shows  some  of  the  many  combinations  of  pizza  and  Pepsi  that  the
               consumer can buy. The first row in the table shows that if the consumer spends all his income
               on pizza, he can eat 100 pizzas during the month, but he would not be able to buy any Pepsi at
               all.  The  second  row  shows  another  possible  consumption  bundle:  90  pizzas  and  50  pints  of
               Pepsi. And so on. Each consumption bundle in the table costs exactly $1,000.

               The graph in Figure 1 illustrates the consumption bundles that the consumer can choose. The
               vertical  axis  measures  the  number  of  pints  of  Pepsi,  and  the  horizontal  axis  measures  the
               number of pizzas. Three points are marked on this figure. At point A, the consumer buys no
               Pepsi and consumes 100 pizzas. At point B, the consumer buys  no pizza and consumes 500
               pints of Pepsi. At point C, the consumer buys 50 pizzas and 250 pints of Pepsi. Point C, which
               is exactly at the middle of the line from A to B, is the point at which the consumer spends an
               equal amount ($500) on pizza  and Pepsi.  These  are  only three  of the many combinations  of
               pizza  and  Pepsi  that  the  consumer  can  choose.  All  the  points  on  the  line  from  A  to  B  are
               possible.  This  line,  called  the  budget  constraint,  shows  the  consumption  bundles  that  the
               consumer  can  afford.  In  this  case,  it  shows  the  trade-off  between  pizza  and  Pepsi  that  the
               consumer faces.


               The slope of the budget constraint measures the rate at which the consumer can trade
               one good for the other. Recall that the slope between two points is calculated as the change in
               the  vertical  distance  divided  by  the  change  in  the  horizontal  distance  (“rise  over  run”).  From
               point A to point B, the vertical distance is 500 pints, and the horizontal distance is 100 pizzas.
               Thus, the slope is 5 pints per pizza. (Actually, because the budget constraint slopes downward,
               the slope is a negative number. But for our purposes, we can ignore the minus sign.)  Notice
               that the slope of the budget constraint equals the relative price  of the two goods—the
               price of one good compared to the price of the other. A pizza costs 5 times as much as a
               pint of Pepsi, so the opportunity cost of a pizza is 5 pints of Pepsi. The budget constraint’s slope
               of 5 reflects the trade-off the market is offering the consumer: 1 pizza for 5 pints of Pepsi.

               Check your understanding

               Draw the budget constraint for a person with income of $1,000 if the price of Pepsi is $5 and the
               price of pizza is $10. What is the slope of this budget constraint?

               Preference:  What Consumer Wants

               Our goal in this lesson is to see how consumers make choices. The budget constraint is one
               piece  of the  analysis: It shows the combinations of goods the consumer  can afford given his
               income and the prices of the goods. The consumer’s choices, however, depend not only on
               his budget constraint but also on his preferences regarding the two goods. Therefore, the
               consumer’s preferences are the next piece of our analysis.

               REPRESENTING PREFERENCES WITH
               INDIFFERENCE CURVES
               The consumer’s preferences allow him to choose among different bundles of pizza and Pepsi. If
               you offer the consumer two different bundles, he chooses the bundle that best suits his tastes. If
               the two bundles suit his tastes equally well, we say that the consumer is indifferent between the
               two bundles.

               Just  as  we  have  represented  the  consumer’s  budget  constraint  graphically,  we  can  also
               represent  his  preferences  graphically.  We  do  this  with  indifference  curves.  An  indifference
               curve shows the bundles of consumption that make the consumer equally happy. In this case,
               the indifference curves show the combinations of pizza and Pepsi with which the consumer is
               equally satisfied.

               Figure 2 shows two of the consumer’s many indifference curves. The consumer is indifferent
               among combinations A, B, and C because they are all on the same curve. Not surprisingly, if the
               consumer’s consumption of pizza is reduced, say, from point A to point B, consumption of Pepsi
               must increase to keep him equally happy. If consumption of pizza is reduced again, from point B
               to point C, the amount of Pepsi consumed must increase yet again.

               The slope at any point on an indifference curve equals the rate at which the consumer is willing
               to  substitute  one  good  for  the  other.  This  rate  is  called  the  marginal  rate  of  substitution
               (MRS). In this case, the marginal rate of substitution measures how much Pepsi the consumer
               requires to be compensated for a one unit reduction in pizza consumption. Notice that because
               the indifference curves are not straight lines, the marginal rate of substitution is not the same at
               all points on a given indifference curve. The rate at which a consumer is willing to trade one
               good for the other depends on the amounts of the goods he is already consuming.


               That is, the rate at which a consumer is willing to trade pizza for Pepsi depends on whether he
               is hungrier or thirstier, which in turn depends on how much pizza and Pepsi he is consuming.

               The  consumer  is  equally  happy  at  all  points  on  any  given  indifference  curve,  but  he  prefers
               some  indifference  curves  to  others.  Because  he  prefers  more  consumption  to  less,  higher
               indifference curves are preferred to lower ones. In Figure 2, any point on curve I2 is preferred to
               any point on curve I1.

               Perfect Substitutes  Suppose that someone  offered  you bundles  of nickels  and dimes. How
               would you rank the different bundles? Most likely, you would care only about the total monetary
               value of each bundle. If so, you would always be willing to trade 2 nickels for 1 dime, regardless
               of the number of nickels and dimes in the bundle. Your marginal rate of substitution between
               nickels and dimes would be a fixed number—2.


               We can represent your preferences over nickels and dimes with the indifference curves in panel
               (a) of Figure 5. Because the marginal rate of substitution is constant, the indifference curves are
               straight lines. In this extreme case of straight indifference curves, we say that the two goods are
               perfect substitutes.


               Perfect Complements. Suppose now that someone offered you bundles of shoes. Some of the
               shoes fit your left foot, others your right foot. How would you rank these different bundles? In
               this case, you might care only about the number of pairs of shoes. In other words, you would
               judge a bundle based on the number of pairs you could assemble from it. A bundle of 5 left
               shoes and 7 right shoes yields only 5 pairs. Getting 1 more right shoe has no value if there is no
               left  shoe  to  go  with  it. We  can  represent  your  preferences  for  right  and  left  shoes  with  the
               indifference curves in panel (b) of Figure 5. In this case, a bundle with 5 left shoes and 5 right


               shoes is just as good as a bundle with 5 left shoes and 7 right shoes. It is also just as good as a
               bundle with 7 left shoes and 5 right shoes. The indifference curves therefore, are right angles. In
               this  extreme  case  of  right-angle  indifference  curves,  we  say  that  the  two  goods  are  perfect
               complements.

               In the real world, of course, most goods are neither perfect substitutes (like nickels and dimes)
               nor perfect complements (like right shoes and left shoes). More typically, the indifference curves
               are bowed inward, but not so bowed as to become right angles



































               OPTIMIZATION:  What the Consumer Chooses

               The goal  of this chapter is to understand how a consumer makes choices. We have the two
               pieces necessary for this analysis: the consumer’s budget constraint (how much he can afford
               to spend) and the consumer’s preferences (what he wants to spend it on). Now we put these
               two pieces together and consider the consumer’s decision about what to buy.


               THE CONSUMER’S OPTIMAL CHOICES
               Consider once again our pizza and Pepsi example. The consumer would like to end up with the
               best possible combination of pizza and Pepsi for him—that is, the combination on his highest
               possible  indifference  curve.  But  the  consumer  must  also  end  up  on  or  below  his  budget
               constraint, which measures the total resources available to him.

               Figure  6  shows  the  consumer’s  budget  constraint  and  three  of  his  many  indifference
               curves. The highest indifference curve that the consumer can reach (I2 in the figure) is the one
               that just barely touches his budget constraint. The point at which this indifference curve and the
               budget constraint touch is called the optimum.

               The consumer would prefer point A, but he cannot afford that point because it lies above his
               budget constraint. The consumer can  afford point B, but that point is on a lower indifference


                                                             37]]></page><page Index="307"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY             Department of Management
                        Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus  BMGT21: Basic Microeconomics


               curve and, therefore, provides the consumer less satisfaction. The optimum represents the best
               combination of pizza and Pepsi available to the consumer.

               Notice that, at the optimum, the slope of the indifference curve equals the slope of the budget
               constraint. We say that the indifference curve is tangent to the budget constraint. The slope of
               the  indifference  curve  is  the  marginal  rate  of  substitution  between  pizza  and  Pepsi,  and  the
               slope  of the budget constraint is the relative price  of pizza  and Pepsi.  Thus, the consumer
               chooses consumption of the two goods so that the marginal rate of substitution equals
               the relative price.

               Market  prices  reflect  the  marginal  value  that  consumers  place  on  goods.  This  analysis  of
               consumer choice shows the same result in another way. In making his consumption choices,
               the consumer takes as given the relative price of the two goods and then chooses an optimum
               at which his marginal rate of substitution equals this relative price. The relative price is the rate
               at  which the  market  is willing  to  trade  one  good  for  the  other,  whereas  the  marginal  rate  of
               substitution is the rate at which the consumer is willing to trade one good for the other. At the
               consumer’s optimum, the consumer’s valuation of the two goods (as measured by the marginal
               rate  of  substitution)  equals  the  market’s  valuation  (as  measured  by  the  relative  price).  As  a
               result  of  this  consumer  optimization,  market  prices  of  different  goods  reflect  the  value  that
               consumers place on those goods.
































               HOW CHANGES IN INCOME AFFECT THE CONSUMER’S CHOICES

               Now that we have seen how the consumer makes a consumption decision, let’s examine how
               this  decision  responds  to  changes  in  the  consumer’s  income.  To  be  specific,  suppose  that


                                                             38]]></page><page Index="308"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY             Department of Management
                        Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus  BMGT21: Basic Microeconomics


               income increases. With higher income, the consumer can afford more of both goods. The
               increase in income, therefore, shifts the budget constraint outward, as in Figure 7. Because the
               relative price of the two goods has not changed, the slope of the new budget constraint is the
               same  as the  slope  of the initial budget constraint. That is,  an increase in income leads to  a
               parallel shift in the budget constraint.

               The expanded budget constraint allows the consumer to choose a better combination of pizza
               and Pepsi, one that is on a higher indifference curve. Given the shift in the budget constraint
               and  the  consumer’s  preferences  as  represented  by  his  indifference  curves,  the  consumer’s
               optimum moves from the point labeled “initial optimum” to the point labeled “new optimum.”

               Notice  that,  in  Figure  7,  the  consumer  chooses  to  consume  more  Pepsi  and  more  pizza.
               Although  the  logic  of  the  model  does  not  require  increased  consumption  of  both  goods  in
               response to increased income, this situation is the most common one. As you may recall from
               Chapter 4, if  a consumer wants more  of  a good when his income rises, economists call it a
               normal good. The indifference curves in Figure 7 are drawn under the assumption that both
               pizza and Pepsi are normal goods.

               Figure 8 shows an example in which an increase in income induces the consumer to buy more
               pizza but less Pepsi. If a consumer buys less of a good when his income rises, economists call
               it an inferior good. Figure 8 is drawn under the assumption that pizza is  a normal good and
               Pepsi is an inferior good. Although most goods are normal goods, there are some inferior goods
               in the world. One example is bus rides. As income increases, consumers are more likely to own
               cars or take a taxi and less likely to ride a bus. Bus rides, therefore, are an inferior good.

               HOW CHANGES IN PRICES AFFECT THE CONSUMER’S CHOICES

               Let’s now use this model of consumer choice to consider how a change in the price of one of
               the goods  alters the consumer’s choices. Suppose, in particular, that the price  of Pepsi  falls
               from  $2 to  $1  per  pint.  It  is  no  surprise  that  the  lower  price  expands  the  consumer’s  set  of
               buying opportunities. In other words, a fall in the price of any good shifts the budget constraint
               outward.

               Figure 9 considers more specifically how the fall in price  affects the budget constraint. If the
               consumer spends his entire $1,000 income on pizza, then the price of Pepsi is irrelevant. Thus,
               point A in the figure stays the same. Yet if the consumer spends his entire income of $1,000 on
               Pepsi,  he  can  now  buy  1,000  rather  than  only  500  pints.  Thus,  the  end  point  of  the  budget
               constraint moves from point B to point D. Notice that in this case the outward shift in the budget
               constraint changes its slope. (This differs from what happened previously when prices stayed
               the same but the consumer’s income changed.) As we have discussed, the slope of the budget
               constraint reflects the relative price of pizza and Pepsi. Because the price of Pepsi has fallen to
               $1 from $2, while the price of pizza has remained $10, the consumer can now trade a pizza for
               10 rather than 5 pints of Pepsi. As a result, the new budget constraint has a steeper slope.







                                                             40]]></page><page Index="310"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY             Department of Management
                        Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus  BMGT21: Basic Microeconomics


               How such a change in the budget constraint alters the consumption of both goods depends on
               the consumer’s preferences. For the indifference curves drawn in this figure, the consumer buys
               more Pepsi and less pizza.

               INCOME AND SUBSTITUTION EFFECTS

               The impact of a change in the price of a good on consumption can be decomposed into two
               effects:  an  income  effect  and  a  substitution  effect.  To  see  what  these  two  effects  are,
               consider how our consumer might respond when he learns that the price of Pepsi has fallen. He
               might reason in the following ways:

               • “Great news! Now that Pepsi is cheaper, my income has greater purchasing power. I am, in
               effect, richer than I was. Because I am richer, I can buy both more pizza and more Pepsi.” (This
               is the income effect.)

               • “Now that the price of Pepsi has fallen, I get more pints of Pepsi for every pizza that I give up.
               Because pizza is now relatively more expensive, I should buy less pizza and more Pepsi.” (This
               is the substitution effect.)

               Which statement do you find more compelling?

               In fact, both of these statements make sense. The decrease in the price of Pepsi makes the
               consumer better off. If pizza and Pepsi are both normal goods, the consumer will want to spread
               this improvement in his purchasing power over both goods. This income effect tends to make
               the consumer buy more pizza and more Pepsi. Yet at the same time, consumption of Pepsi has
               become less expensive relative to consumption of pizza. This substitution effect tends to make
               the consumer choose less pizza and more Pepsi.

               Now consider the result of these two effects working at the same time. The consumer certainly
               buys more Pepsi because the income and substitution effects both act to raise purchases of
               Pepsi. But it is ambiguous whether the consumer buys more pizza because the income  and
               substitution effects work in opposite directions. This conclusion is summarized in Table 1.

               We can interpret the income and substitution effects using indifference curves.

               The  income  effect  is  the  change  in  consumption  that  results  from  the  movement  to  a  higher
               indifference curve. The substitution effect is the change in consumption that results from being at a point
               on an indifference curve with a different marginal rate of substitution.

               DERIVING THE DEMAND CURVE

               We have just seen how changes in the price of a good alter the consumer’s budget constraint
               and, therefore, the quantities of the two goods that he chooses to buy. The demand curve for
               any good reflects these consumption decisions. Recall that a demand curve shows the quantity
               demanded  of  a  good  for  any  given  price.  We  can  view  a  consumer’s  demand  curve  as  a
               summary of the optimal decisions that arise from his budget constraint and indifference curves.



                                                             42]]></page><page Index="312"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY             Department of Management
                        Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus  BMGT21: Basic Microeconomics


               For example, Figure 11 considers the demand for Pepsi. Panel (a) shows that when the price of
               a pint falls from $2 to $1, the consumer’s budget constraint shifts outward. Because of   income
               and substitution effects, the consumer increases his purchases of Pepsi from 250 to 750 pints.
               Panel (b) shows the demand curve that results from this consumer’s decisions. In this way, the
               theory  of  consumer  choice  provides  the  theoretical  foundation  for  the  consumer’s  demand
               curve.

               It  may  be  comforting  to  know  that  the  demand  curve  arises  naturally  from  the  theory  of
               consumer choice, but this exercise by itself does not justify developing the theory. There is no
               need  for  a  rigorous,  analytic  framework  just  to  establish  that  people  respond  to  changes  in
               prices. The theory  of consumer choice is, however, useful in studying  various decisions that
               people make as they go about their lives, as we see in the next section.

               CONCLUSION: DO PEOPLE REALLY THINK THIS WAY?
               The theory of consumer choice describes how people make decisions. As we have seen, it
               has broad applicability. It can explain how a person chooses between pizza and Pepsi, work
               and leisure, consumption and saving, and on and on.

               At this point, however, you might be tempted to treat the theory of consumer choice with some
               skepticism. After all, you are a consumer. You decide what to buy every time you walk into a
               store. And you know that you do not decide by writing down budget constraints and indifference
               curves. Doesn’t this knowledge about your own decision making provide evidence against the
               theory?  The  answer  is  no.  The  theory  of  consumer  choice  does  not  try  to  present  a  literal
               account of how people make decisions. It is a model. In our previous lessons, models are not
               intended to be completely realistic.

               The best way to view the theory of consumer choice is as a metaphor for how consumers make
               decisions. No consumer (except an occasional economist) goes through the explicit optimization
               envisioned in the theory. Yet consumers are aware that their choices are constrained by their
               financial  resources.  And  given  those  constraints,  they  do  the  best  they  can  to  achieve  the
               highest level of satisfaction.

               The theory of consumer choice tries to describe this implicit, psychological process in a way that
               permits explicit, economic analysis. Just as the proof of the pudding is in the eating, the test of a
               theory is in its applications.

               TERMINOLOGY FOR REVIEW

               Budget Constraint - the limit on the consumption bundles that a consumer can afford

               Indifference Curve - a curve that shows consumption bundles that give the consumer the same
               level of satisfaction

               Marginal rate of substitution - the rate at which a consumer is willing to trade one good

               WEEK 6
               LESSON:  HOW MARKETS WORK – MARKET AND COMPETITION

               Learning Outcomes:

               After the completion of the chapter, students should be able to:

               1.  State the law of demand and supply;

               2.  Relate the factors that affect demand and supply;

               3.  Explain briefly the elasticity of demand, and

               4.  Solve problems related to elasticity of demand and supply


               Overview:

               When a cold snap hits Florida, the price of orange juice rises in supermarkets throughout the
               country. When the weather turns warm in New England every summer, the price of hotel rooms
               in the Caribbean plummets. When a war breaks out in the Middle East, the price of gasoline in
               the United States rises, and the price of a used Cadillac falls. What do these events have  in
               common? They all show the workings of supply and demand.

               Supply  and  demand  are  the  two  words  economists  use  most  often—and  for  good  reason.
               Supply  and  demand  are  the  forces  that  make  market  economies  work.  They  determine  the
               quantity of each good produced and the price at which it is sold. If you want to know how any
               event or policy will affect the economy, you must think first about how it will affect supply and
               demand.

               This chapter introduces the theory of supply and demand. It considers how buyers and sellers
               behave and how they interact with one another. It shows how supply and demand determine
               prices in a market economy and how prices, in turn, allocate the economy’s scarce resources.


               Discussion

               MARKET AND COMPETITION

               The terms supply and demand refer to the behavior of people as they interact with one another
               in competitive markets. Before discussing how buyers  and  sellers behave, let’s first consider
               more fully what we mean by the terms market and competition.





                                                             45]]></page><page Index="315"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY             Department of Management
                        Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus  BMGT21: Basic Microeconomics


               WHAT IS A MARKET?
               A market is a group of buyers and sellers of a particular good or service. The buyers as a group
               determine the demand for the product, and the sellers as a group determine the supply of the
               product.

               Markets take many forms. Sometimes markets are highly organized, such  as the markets for
               many agricultural commodities. In these markets, buyers and sellers meet at a specific time and
               place, where an auctioneer helps set prices and arrange sales.

               More often, markets are less organized. For example, consider the market for  ice cream in a
               particular town. Buyers of ice cream do not meet together at any one time. The sellers of ice
               cream are in different locations and offer somewhat different products. There is no auctioneer
               calling out the price of ice cream. Each seller posts a price for an ice-cream cone, and each
               buyer decides how much ice cream to buy at each store. Nonetheless, these consumers and
               producers  of  ice  cream  are  closely  connected.  The  ice-cream  buyers  are  choosing  from  the
               various  ice-cream  sellers  to  satisfy  their  hunger,  and  the  ice-cream  sellers  are  all  trying  to
               appeal to the same ice-cream buyers to make their businesses successful. Even though it is not
               organized, the group of ice-cream buyers and ice-cream sellers forms a market.


               WHAT IS COMPETITION?
               The market for ice cream, like most markets in the economy, is highly competitive. Each buyer
               knows that there are several sellers from which to choose, and each seller is aware that his or
               her product is similar to that offered by other sellers. As a result, the price of ice cream and the
               quantity of ice cream sold are not determined by any single buyer or seller. Rather, price and
               quantity are determined by all buyers and sellers as they interact in the marketplace.

               Economists use the term competitive market to describe a market in which there are so many
               buyers and so many sellers that each has a negligible impact on the market price. Each seller of
               ice cream has limited control over the price because other sellers are offering similar products.
               A seller has little reason to charge less than the going price, and if he or she charges more,
               buyers  will  make  their  purchases  elsewhere.  Similarly,  no  single  buyer  of  ice  cream  can
               influence the price of ice cream because each buyer purchases only a small amount.

               In this lesson, we assume that markets are perfectly competitive. To reach this highest form of
               competition, a market must have two characteristics:

               (1) the goods offered for sale are all exactly the same, and

               (2) the buyers and sellers are so numerous that no single buyer or seller has any influence over
               the market price.

               Because buyers and sellers in perfectly competitive markets must accept the price the market
               determines, they are said to be price takers. At the market price, buyers can buy all they want,
               and sellers can sell all they want.

               There are some markets in which the assumption of perfect competition applies perfectly. In the
               wheat  market,  for  example,  there  are  thousands  of  farmers  who  sell  wheat  and  millions  of

                                                             46]]></page><page Index="316"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY             Department of Management
                        Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus  BMGT21: Basic Microeconomics


               consumers who use wheat and wheat products. Because no single buyer or seller can influence
               the price of wheat, each takes the price as given.

               Not all goods and services, however, are sold in perfectly competitive markets. Some markets
               have only one seller, and this seller sets the price. Such a seller is called a monopoly. Your local
               cable television company, for instance, may be a monopoly. Residents of your town probably
               have only one cable company from which to buy this service. Still other markets fall between the
               extremes of perfect competition and monopoly.

               Despite the diversity  of market types we find in the world,  assuming perfect competition is  a
               useful simplification and, therefore, a natural place to start.  Perfectly competitive markets are
               the easiest to analyze because everyone participating in the market takes the price as given by
               market conditions. Moreover, because some degree of competition is present in most markets,
               many of the lessons that we learn by studying supply and demand under perfect competition
               apply in more complicated markets as well.

               example of a monopolized market and perfectly competitive market.

               DEMAND
               We begin our study of markets by examining the behavior of buyers. To focus our thinking, let’s
               keep in mind a particular good—ice cream.


               THE DEMAND CURVE: THE
               RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PRICE AND QUANTITY   DEMANDED

               The quantity demanded of any good is the amount of the good that buyers are willing and able
               to purchase. As we will see, many things determine the quantity demanded of any good, but
               when analyzing how markets work, one determinant plays a central role—the price of the good.
               If the price of ice cream rose to $20 per scoop, you would buy less ice cream. You might buy
               frozen yogurt instead. If the price of ice cream fell to $0.20 per scoop, you would buy more.

                This relationship between price and quantity demanded is true for most goods in the economy
               and, in fact, is so pervasive that economists call it the law of demand: Other things equal, when
               the price of a good rises, the quantity demanded of the good falls, and when the price falls, the
               quantity demanded rises.

               The table in Figure 1 shows how many ice-cream cones Catherine buys each month at different
               prices of ice cream. If ice cream is free, Catherine eats 12 cones per month. At $0.50 per cone,
               Catherine  buys  10  cones  each month.  As the  price  rises  further,  she  buys  fewer  and  fewer
               cones. When the price reaches $3.00, Catherine doesn’t buy any ice cream at all.






                                                             47]]></page><page Index="317"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY             Department of Management

               This table is  a  demand schedule,  a table that shows the  relationship between the price  of  a
               good and the quantity demanded, holding constant everything else that influences how much
               consumers of the good want to buy.







































               The  graph  in  Figure  1  uses  the  numbers  from  the  table  to  illustrate  the  law  of  demand.  By
               convention,  the  price  of  ice  cream  is  on  the  vertical  axis,  and  the  quantity  of  ice  cream
               demanded  is  on  the  horizontal  axis.  The  downward-sloping  line  relating  price  and  quantity
               demanded is called the demand curve.


               MARKET DEMAND VERSUS INDIVIDUAL DEMAND
               The demand curve in Figure 1 shows an individual’s demand for  a product. To analyze how
               markets work, we need to determine the market demand, the sum of all the individual demands
               for a particular good or service.

               The table in Figure 2 shows the demand schedules for ice cream of the two individuals in this
               market—Catherine and Nicholas. At any price, Catherine’s demand schedule tells us how much
               ice cream she buys, and Nicholas’s demand schedule tells us how much ice cream he buys.
               The market demand at each price is the sum of the two individual demands.

               The graph in Figure 2 shows the demand curves that correspond to these demand schedules.
               Notice  that  we  sum  the  individual  demand  curves  horizontally  to  obtain  the  market  demand



                                                             48]]></page><page Index="318"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY             Department of Management

               curve. That is, to find the total quantity demanded at any price, we add the individual quantities,
               which are found on the horizontal axis of the individual demand curves.

               Because  we  are  interested  in  analyzing  how  markets  function,  we  work most  often  with  the
               market demand curve. The market demand curve shows how the total quantity demanded of a
               good varies  as the price  of the good  varies, while all the  other  factors that  affect how much
               consumers want to buy are held constant.

               SHIFTS IN THE DEMAND CURVE
               Because the market demand curve holds other things constant, it need not be stable over time.
               If  something  happens  to  alter  the  quantity  demanded  at  any  given  price,  the  demand  curve
               shifts.  For  example,  suppose  the  American  Medical  Association  discovered  that  people  who
               regularly eat ice cream live longer, healthier lives. The discovery would raise the demand for ice
               cream. At any given price, buyers would now want to purchase a larger quantity of ice cream,
               and the demand curve for ice cream would shift.

               Figure 3 illustrates shifts in demand. Any change that increases the quantity demanded at every
               price, such as our imaginary discovery by the American Medical Association, shifts the demand
               curve to the right and is called an increase in demand. Any change that reduces the quantity
               demanded  at  every  price  shifts  the  demand  curve  to  the  left  and  is  called  a  decrease  in
               demand.

               There are many variables that can shift the demand curve. Here are the most important.

               Income What would happen to your demand for ice cream if you lost your job one summer?
               Most likely, it would fall. A lower income means that you have less to spend in total, so you
               would have to spend less on some—and probably most—goods. If the demand for a good falls
               when income falls, the good is called a normal good.

               Not all goods are normal goods. If the demand for a good rises when income falls, the good is
               called an inferior good. An example of an inferior good might be bus rides. As your income
               falls, you are less likely to buy a car or take a cab and more likely to ride a bus.

               Prices of Related Goods Suppose that the price of frozen yogurt falls. The law of demand says
               that you will buy more frozen yogurt. At the same time, you will probably buy less ice cream.
               Because ice cream and frozen yogurt are both cold, sweet, creamy desserts, they satisfy similar
               desires. When a fall in the price of  one good reduces the demand for another good, the two
               goods are called substitutes.

               Substitutes are often pairs of goods that are used in place of each other, such as hot dogs and
               hamburgers, sweaters and sweatshirts, and movie tickets and video rentals. Now suppose that
               the price of hot fudge falls. According to the law of demand, you will buy more hot fudge. Yet in
               this case, you will buy more ice cream as well because ice cream and hot fudge are often used
               together. When a  fall in the price  of  one good  raises the demand for  another good, the two
               goods are called complements. Complements are often pairs of goods that are used together,
               such as gasoline and automobiles, computers and software, and peanut butter and jelly.

               Tastes The most obvious determinant of your demand is your tastes. If you like ice cream, you
               buy more  of it. Economists normally do not try to explain people’s tastes because tastes  are
               based  on  historical  and  psychological  forces  that  are  beyond  the  realm  of  economics.
               Economists do, however, examine what happens when tastes change.

               Expectations Your expectations about the future may affect your demand for a good or service
               today. For example, if you expect to earn a higher income next month, you may choose to save
               less now and spend more of your current income buying ice cream. As another example, if you
               expect the price of ice cream to fall tomorrow, you may be less willing to buy an ice-cream cone
               at today’s price.

               Number  of  Buyers  In  addition  to  the  preceding  factors,  which  influence  the  behavior  of
               individual buyers, market demand depends on the number of these buyers. If Peter were to join
               Catherine  and  Nicholas  as  another  consumer  of  ice  cream,  the  quantity  demanded  in  the
               market would be higher at every price, and market demand would increase.

               SUMMARY

               The demand curve shows what happens to the quantity demanded  of  a  good when its price
               varies, holding constant all the other variables that influence buyers. Then one of these other
               variables changes, the demand curve shifts.

               Table 1 lists the variables that influence how much consumers choose to buy of a good. If you
               have trouble remembering whether you need to shift or move along the demand curve, it helps
               to  recall  a  lesson.  A  curve  shifts  when  there  is  a  change  in  a  relevant  variable  that  is  not
               measured on either axis. Because the price is on the vertical axis, a change in price represents
               a movement along the demand curve. By contrast, income, the prices of related goods, tastes,
               expectations, and the number of buyers are not measured on either axis, so a change in one of
               these variables shifts the demand curve.

               SUPPLY

               We now turn to the other side of the market and examine the behavior of sellers. Once again, to
               focus our thinking, let’s consider the market for ice cream.

               THE SUPPLY CURVE: THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PRICE AND QUANTITY SUPPLIED

               The quantity supplied of any good or service is the amount that sellers are willing and able to
               sell. There are many determinants of quantity supplied, but once again, price plays a special
               role in our analysis. When the price of ice cream is high, selling ice cream is profitable, and so
               the  quantity  supplied  is  large.  Sellers  of  ice  cream  work  long  hours,  buy  many  ice-cream
               machines, and hire many workers.

               By contrast, when the price of ice cream is low, the business is less profitable, and so sellers
               produce less ice cream. At a low price, some sellers may even choose to shut down, and their
               quantity supplied falls to zero. This relationship between price and quantity supplied is called the
               law of supply: Other things equal, when the price of a good rises, the quantity supplied of the
               good also rises, and when the price falls, the quantity supplied falls as well.

               The table in Figure 5 shows the quantity of ice-cream cones supplied each month by Ben, an
               ice-cream seller, at various prices of ice cream. At a price below $1.00, Ben does not supply
               any ice cream at all. As the price rises, he supplies a greater and greater quantity. This is the
               supply  schedule,  a  table  that  shows  the  relationship  between  the  price  of  a  good  and  the
               quantity supplied, holding constant everything else that influences how much producers of the
               good want to sell.

               The graph in Figure 5 uses the numbers from the table to illustrate the law of supply. The curve
               relating price and quantity supplied is called the supply curve. The supply curve slopes upward
               because, other things equal, a higher price means a greater quantity supplied.


               MARKET SUPPLY VERSUS INDIVIDUAL SUPPLY
               Just as market demand is the sum of the demands of all buyers, market supply is the sum of the
               supplies of all sellers. The table in Figure 6 shows the supply schedules for the two ice-cream
               producers  in  the  market—Ben  and  Jerry.  At  any  price,  Ben’s  supply  schedule  tells  us  the
               quantity  of  ice  cream  Ben  supplies,  and  Jerry’s  supply  schedule  tells  us  the  quantity  of  ice
               cream Jerry supplies. The market supply is the sum of the two individual supplies.

               The graph in Figure 6 shows the supply curves that correspond to the supply schedules. As with
               demand curves, we sum the individual supply curves horizontally to obtain the market supply
               curve. That is, to find the total quantity supplied at any price, we add the individual quantities,
               which are found on the horizontal axis of the individual supply curves. The market supply curve
               shows how the total quantity supplied varies as the price of the good varies, holding constant all
               the other factors beyond price that influence producers’ decisions about how much to sell.

               SHIFTS IN THE SUPPLY CURVE
               Because the market supply curve holds other things constant, the curve shifts when one of the
               factors changes. For example, suppose the price of sugar falls. Sugar is an input into producing
               ice cream, so the fall in the price of sugar makes selling ice cream more profitable. This raises
               the supply of ice cream: At any given price, sellers are now willing to produce a larger quantity.
               The supply curve for ice cream shifts to the right.



               Figure 7 illustrates shifts in supply. Any change that raises quantity supplied at every price, such
               as a fall in the price of sugar, shifts the supply curve to the right and is called an increase in
               supply. Similarly, any change that reduces the quantity supplied at every price shifts the supply
               curve to the left and is called a decrease in supply.

               There are many variables that can shift the supply curve. Here are some of the most important.

               Input Prices  To  produce  their  output  of  ice  cream,  sellers  use  various  inputs: cream,  sugar,
               flavoring, ice-cream machines, the buildings in which the ice cream is made, and the labor of
               workers to mix the ingredients and operate the machines.

               When the price of one or more of these inputs rises, producing ice cream is less profitable, and
               firms supply less ice cream. If input prices rise substantially, a firm might shut down and supply
               no ice cream at all. Thus, the supply of a good is negatively related to the price of the inputs
               used to make the good.

               Technology The technology for turning inputs into ice cream is another determinant of supply.
               The invention of the mechanized ice-cream machine, for example, reduced the amount of labor
               necessary to make ice cream. By reducing firms’ costs, the advance in technology raised the
               supply of ice cream.

               Expectations The amount of ice cream a firm supplies today may depend on its expectations
               about the future. For example, if a firm expects the price of ice cream to rise in the future, it will
               put some of its current production into storage and supply less to the market today.

               Number of Sellers In addition to the preceding factors, which influence the behavior of individual
               sellers, market supply depends on the number of these sellers. If Ben or Jerry were to retire
               from the ice-cream business, the supply in the market would fall.


               SUMMARY

               The supply curve shows what happens to the quantity supplied of a good when its price varies,
               holding constant all the other variables that influence sellers. When one of these other variables
               change, the supply curve shifts. Table 2 lists the variables that influence how much producers
               choose to sell of a good. Once again, to remember whether you need to shift or move along the
               supply curve, keep in mind that a curve shifts only when there is a change in a relevant variable

                                                             53]]></page><page Index="323"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY             Department of Management

               that  is  not  named  on  either  axis.  The  price  is  on  the  vertical  axis,  so  a  change  in  price
               represents a movement along the supply curve. By contrast, because input prices, technology,
               expectations, and the number of sellers are not measured on either axis, a change in one of
               these variables shifts the supply curve.






















































               SUPPLY AND DEMAND TOGETHER

               Having  analyzed  supply  and  demand  separately,  we  now  combine  them  to  see  how  they
               determine the price and quantity of a good sold in a market.

               EQUILIBRIUM
               Figure 8 shows the market supply curve and market demand curve together. Notice that there is
               one point at which the supply and demand curves intersect. This point is called the  market’s
               equilibrium. The price at this intersection is called the  equilibrium price, and the quantity is
               called the equilibrium quantity.

               Here the equilibrium price is $2.00 per cone, and the equilibrium quantity is 7 ice cream cones.
               The  dictionary  defines  the  word  equilibrium  as  a  situation  in  which  various  forces  are  in
               balance—and this also describes a market’s equilibrium. At the equilibrium price, the quantity
               of the good that buyers are willing and able to buy exactly balances the quantity that
               sellers  are willing  and  able  to  sell. The  equilibrium  price  is  sometimes  called  the  market-
               clearing price because, at this price, everyone in the market has been satisfied: Buyers have
               bought all they want to buy, and sellers have sold all they want to sell.

               The actions of buyers and sellers naturally move markets toward the equilibrium of supply and
               demand.  To  see  why,  consider  what  happens  when  the  market  price  is  not  equal  to  the
               equilibrium price. Suppose first that the market price is above the equilibrium price, as in panel
               (a)  of  Figure  9.  At  a  price  of  $2.50  per  cone,  the  quantity  of  the  good  supplied  (10  cones)
               exceeds the quantity demanded (4 cones). There is a surplus of the good:

               Suppliers are unable to sell all they want at the going price. A surplus is sometimes called  a
               situation of excess supply. When there is a surplus in the ice-cream market, sellers of ice cream
               find  their  freezers  increasingly  full  of  ice  cream  they  would  like  to  sell  but  cannot.  They
               respond  to  the  surplus  by  cutting  their  prices.  Falling  prices,  in  turn,  increase  the  quantity
               demanded and decrease the quantity supplied.

               Prices continue to fall until the market reaches the equilibrium. Suppose now that the market
               price is below the equilibrium price, as in panel (b) of Figure 9. In this case, the price is $1.50
               per cone,  and the quantity of the good demanded  exceeds the quantity supplied. There is  a
               shortage of the good:

               Demanders are unable to buy all they want at the going price. A shortage is sometimes called a
               situation of excess demand. When a shortage occurs in the ice-cream market, buyers have to
               wait in long lines for  a chance to buy  one of the few cones  available. With too many buyers
               chasing too few goods, sellers can respond to the shortage by raising their prices without losing
               sales.  As  the  price  rises,  the  quantity  demanded  falls,  the  quantity  supplied  rises,  and  the
               market once again moves toward the equilibrium.

               Thus, the activities of the many buyers and sellers automatically push the market price toward
               the  equilibrium  price.  Once  the  market  reaches  its  equilibrium,  all  buyers  and  sellers  are
               satisfied, and there is no upward or downward pressure on the price. How quickly equilibrium is
               reached  varies  from market  to  market  depending  on  how  quickly  prices  adjust.  In most  free
               markets, surpluses and shortages are only temporary because prices eventually move toward
               their  equilibrium levels. Indeed, this phenomenon is so pervasive that it is called  the law of
               supply and demand: The price of any good adjusts to bring the quantity supplied and
               quantity demanded for that good into balance.

               SUMMARY

                     Economists use the model of supply and demand to analyze competitive markets. In a
                       competitive market, there  are many buyers  and sellers, each of whom has little or no
                       influence on the market price.

                     The demand curve shows how the quantity of a good demanded depends on the price.
                       According to the law of demand, as the price  of  a good falls, the quantity demanded
                       rises. Therefore, the demand curve slopes downward.

                     In  addition  to  price,  other  determinants  of  how much consumers  want  to  buy  include
                       income,  the  prices  of  substitutes  and  complements,  tastes,  expectations,  and  the
                       number of buyers. If one of these factors changes, the demand curve shifts.

                     The  supply  curve  shows  how  the  quantity  of  a  good  supplied  depends  on  the  price.
                       According to the law of supply, as the price of a good rises, the quantity supplied rises.
                       Therefore, the supply curve slopes upward.

                     In addition to price, other determinants of how much producers want to sell include input
                       prices,  technology,  expectations,  and  the  number  of  sellers.  If  one  of  these  factors
                       changes, the supply curve shifts.
                     The intersection of the supply and demand curves determines the market equilibrium. At
                       the equilibrium price, the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied.

                     The  behavior  of  buyers  and  sellers  naturally  drives  markets  toward  their  equilibrium.
                       When the market price is  above the  equilibrium price, there is  a surplus of the good,
                       which causes the market price to fall. When the market price is below the  equilibrium
                       price, there is a shortage, which causes the market price to rise.

                     To analyze how any event influences a market, we use the supply-and-demand diagram
                       to examine how the event affects the equilibrium price and quantity. To do this, we follow
                       three steps. First, we decide whether the event shifts the supply curve or the demand
                       curve  (or  both).  Second,  we  decide  in  which  direction  the  curve  shifts.  Third,  we
                       compare the new equilibrium with the initial equilibrium.

                     In market economies, prices are the signals that guide economic decisions and thereby
                       allocate scarce resources. For every good in the economy, the price ensures that supply
                       and  demand  are  in  balance.  The  equilibrium  price  then  determines  how much  of  the
                       good buyers choose to consume and how much sellers choose to produce.

               1. Explain each of the following statements using supply-and-demand diagrams.

               a. “When a cold snap hits Florida, the price of orange juice rises in supermarkets throughout the
               country.”

               b. “When the weather turns warm in New England every summer, the price of hotel rooms in
               Caribbean resorts plummets.”

               c. “When a war breaks out in the Middle East, the price of gasoline rises, and the price of a used

               2. “An increase in the demand for notebooks raises the quantity of notebooks demanded but not
               the quantity supplied.” Is this statement true or false? Explain.

               3. Consider the market for minivans. For each of the events listed here, identify which of the
               determinants  of  demand  or  supply  are  affected.  Also  indicate  whether  demand  or  supply
               increases or decreases. Then draw a diagram to show the effect on the price and quantity of
               minivans.

               LESSON:  ELASTICITY AND ITS APPLICATION

               Learning Objectives:

               After the completion of the chapter, students should be able to:
               1.  Explain briefly the elasticity and its application
               2.  Solve problems related to elasticity of demand and supply;
               3.  Differentiate price ceiling and price floors
               4.  Explain how price ceiling and price floors affect market outcomes; and
               5.  Identify government policies regarding prices

               Overview:
               Imagine that some event drives up the price of gasoline in the United States. It could be a war in
               the Middle East that disrupts the world supply of oil, a booming Chinese economy that boosts
               the  world  demand  for  oil,  or  a  new  tax  on  gasoline  passed  by  Congress.  How  would  U.S.
               consumers respond to the higher price?

               It is easy to answer this question in broad fashion: Consumers would buy less. That is simply
               the law of demand we learned in the previous lesson. But you might want a precise answer. By
               how much would consumption of gasoline fall? This question can be answered using a concept
               called elasticity, which we develop in this lesson.

               Elasticity  is  a  measure  of  how  much  buyers  and  sellers  respond  to  changes  in  market
               conditions. When studying how some event or policy affects a market, we can discuss not only
               the direction of the effects but their magnitude as well. Elasticity is useful in many applications,
               as we will see toward the end of this lesson.

               Before proceeding, however, you might be curious about the answer to the gasoline question.
               Many studies have  examined consumers’ response to gasoline prices, and they typically find
               that the quantity demanded responds more in the long run than it does in the short run. A 10
               percent increase in gasoline prices reduces gasoline consumption by about 2.5 percent after a
               year  and  about  6  percent  after  five  years.  About  half  of  the  long-run  reduction  in  quantity
               demanded arises because people drive less and half because they switch to more fuel-efficient
               cars. Both responses are reflected in the demand curve and its elasticity.
               Study these terms

               Discussion

               THE ELASTICITY OF DEMAND

               When we  introduced  demand  in  our  previous  lesson,  we  noted  that  consumers  usually  buy
               more  of  a  good  when  its  price  is  lower,  when  their  incomes  are  higher,  when  the  prices  of
               substitutes for the good are higher, or when the prices of complements of the good are lower.
               Our discussion of demand was qualitative, not quantitative. That is, we discussed the direction
               in  which  quantity  demanded  moves  but  not  the  size  of  the  change.  To  measure  how  much
               consumers respond to changes in these variables, economists use the concept of elasticity.


               THE PRICE ELASTICITY OF DEMAND AND ITS DETERMINANTS

               The law of demand states that a fall in the price of a good raises the quantity demanded. The
               price elasticity of demand measures how much the quantity demanded responds to a change
               in  price.  Demand  for  a  good  is  said  to  be  elastic  if  the  quantity  demanded  responds
               substantially to changes in the price. Demand is said to be inelastic if the quantity demanded
               responds only slightly to changes in the price.

               The price elasticity of demand for any good measures how willing consumers are to buy less of
               the  good  as  its  price  rises.  Thus,  the  elasticity  reflects  the  many  economic,  social,  and
               psychological forces that shape consumer preferences. Based on experience, however, we can
               state some general rules about what determines the price elasticity of demand.

               Availability  of  Close  Substitutes  Goods  with  close  substitutes  tend  to  have  more  elastic
               demand because it is easier for consumers to switch from that good to others.  For example,
               butter and margarine are easily substitutable. A small increase in the price of butter, assuming
               the price of margarine is held fixed, causes the quantity of butter sold to fall by a large amount.
               By contrast, because eggs are a food without a close substitute, the demand for eggs is less
               elastic than the demand for butter.

               Necessities versus Luxuries  Necessities tend to have inelastic demands, whereas luxuries
               have  elastic  demands.  When  the  price  of  a  doctor’s  visit  rises,  people  will  not  dramatically
               reduce the number of times they go to the doctor, although they might go somewhat less often.
               By  contrast,  when  the  price  of  sailboats  rises,  the  quantity  of  sailboats  demanded  falls
               substantially. The reason is that most people view doctor visits as a necessity and sailboats as
               a  luxury.  Of  course,  whether  a  good  is  a  necessity  or  a  luxury  depends  not  on  the  intrinsic
               properties of the good but on the preferences of the buyer. For avid sailors with little concern
               over their health, sailboats might be a necessity with inelastic demand and doctor visits a luxury
               with elastic demand.

               Definition of the Market The elasticity of demand in any market depends on how we draw the
               boundaries  of the market.  Narrowly defined markets tend to have more  elastic demand than
               broadly defined markets because it is easier to find close substitutes for narrowly defined goods.
               For example, food, a broad category, has a fairly inelastic demand because there are no good
               substitutes for food. Ice cream, a narrower category, has a more elastic demand because it is
               easy to substitute other desserts for ice cream. Vanilla ice cream, a very narrow category, has a


                                                             60]]></page><page Index="330"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY             Department of Management
                        Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus  BMGT21: Basic Microeconomics


               very  elastic  demand  because  other  flavors  of  ice  cream  are  almost  perfect  substitutes  for
               vanilla.

               Time Horizon Goods tend to have more elastic demand over longer time horizons. When the
               price  of  gasoline  rises,  the  quantity  of  gasoline  demanded  falls  only  slightly  in  the  first  few
               months. Over time, however, people buy more fuel-efficient cars, switch to public transportation,
               and move closer to where they work. Within several years, the quantity of gasoline demanded
               falls more substantially.

               COMPUTING THE PRICE ELASTICITY OF DEMAND
               Now  that  we  have  discussed  the  price  elasticity  of  demand  in  general  terms,  let’s  be  more
               precise  about how it is measured. Economists compute the price elasticity of demand as the
               percentage change in the quantity demanded divided by the percentage  change in the price.
               That is,

               Price elasticity of demand = Percentage change in quantity demanded
               .                                           Percentage change in price

               For example, suppose that a 10 percent increase in the price of an ice-cream cone causes the
               amount of ice cream you buy to fall by 20 percent. We calculate your elasticity of demand as

               Price elasticity of demand = 20 percent   = 2.
                                                           10 percent

               In  this  example,  the  elasticity  is  2,  reflecting  that  the  change  in  the  quantity  demanded  is
               proportionately twice as large as the change in the price. Because the quantity demanded of a
               good is negatively related to its price, the percentage change in quantity will always have the
               opposite sign as the percentage change in price.

               In this example, the percentage change in price is a positive 10 percent (reflecting an increase),
               and  the  percentage  change  in  quantity  demanded  is  a  negative  20  percent  (reflecting  a
               decrease).  For  this  reason,  price  elasticities  of  demand  are  sometimes  reported  as  negative
               numbers. In our reference book, we follow the common practice of dropping the minus sign and
               reporting  all  price  elasticities  of  demand  as  positive  numbers.  (Mathematicians  call  this  the
               absolute value.) With this convention, a larger price elasticity implies a greater responsiveness
               of quantity demanded to price.

               THE MIDPOINT METHOD: A BETTER WAY TO CALCULATE
               PERCENTAGE CHANGES AND ELASTICITIES
               If you try calculating the price elasticity of demand between two points on a demand curve, you
               will quickly notice an annoying problem: The elasticity from point A to point B seems different
               from the elasticity from point B to point A. For example, consider these numbers:

                                                 Point A: Price = $4 Quantity = 120

                                                 Point B: Price = $6 Quantity =   80


                                                             61]]></page><page Index="331"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY             Department of Management
                        Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus  BMGT21: Basic Microeconomics


               Going from point A to point B, the price rises by 50 percent, and the quantity falls by 33 percent,
               indicating that the price elasticity of demand is 33/50, or 0.66. By contrast, going from point B to
               point A, the price falls by 33 percent, and the quantity rises by 50 percent, indicating that the
               price  elasticity  of  demand  is  50/33,  or  1.5.  This  difference  arises  because  the  percentage
               changes are calculated from a different base.

               One way to avoid this problem is to use the midpoint method for calculating elasticities. The
               standard procedure  for computing a percentage change is to divide the  change by the initial
               level. By contrast, the midpoint method computes a percentage change by dividing the change
               by  the  midpoint  (or  average)  of  the  initial  and  final  levels.  For  instance,  $5  is  the  midpoint
               between $4 and $6. Therefore, according to the midpoint method, a change from $4 to $6 is
               considered a 40 percent rise because (6 – 4) / 5 × 100 = 40. Similarly, a change from $6 to $4 is
               considered a 40 percent fall.

               Because the midpoint method gives the same answer regardless of the direction of change, it is
               often used when calculating the price elasticity of demand between two points. In our example,
               the midpoint between point A and point B is:

                                                  Midpoint: Price = $5 Quantity = 100

               According to the midpoint method, when going from point A to point B, the price rises by 40
               percent, and the quantity falls by 40 percent. Similarly, when going from point B to point A, the
               price  falls  by  40  percent,  and  the  quantity  rises  by  40  percent.  In  both  directions,  the  price
               elasticity of demand equals 1.

               The  following  formula  expresses  the  midpoint  method  for  calculating  the  price  elasticity  of
               demand between two points, denoted (Q1, P1) and (Q2, P2):

                             Price elasticity of demand = (Q2 – Q1) / [(Q2 + Q1) / 2]
               .                                                          (P2 – P1) / [(P2 + P1) / 2]

               The numerator is the percentage change in quantity computed using the midpoint method, and
               the denominator is the percentage change in price computed using the midpoint method. If you
               ever need to calculate elasticities, you should use this formula. In this book, however, we rarely
               perform  such  calculations.  For  most  of  our  purposes,  what  elasticity  represents—the
               responsiveness of quantity demanded to a change in price—is more important than how
               it is calculated.

               THE VARIETY OF DEMAND CURVES
               Economists classify demand curves according to their elasticity. Demand is considered elastic
               when the elasticity  is greater than 1, which means the quantity moves proportionately
               more than the price. Demand is considered inelastic when the elasticity is less than 1,
               which means the quantity moves proportionately less than the price. If the elasticity is
               exactly 1, the quantity moves the same amount proportionately as the price, and demand
               is said to have unit elasticity.

               Because the price  elasticity of demand measures how much quantity demanded responds to
               changes in the price, it is closely related to the slope of the demand curve. The following rule of
               thumb is a useful guide: The flatter the demand curve that passes through a given point, the
               greater the price  elasticity of demand. The steeper the demand curve that passes through  a
               given point, the smaller the price elasticity of demand.

               Figure 1 shows five cases. In the extreme case of a zero elasticity, shown in panel (a), demand
               is perfectly inelastic, and the demand curve is vertical. In this case, regardless of the price, the
               quantity demanded stays the same. As the elasticity rises, the demand curve gets flatter and
               flatter, as shown in panels (b), (c), and (d). At the opposite extreme, shown in panel (e), demand
               is perfectly elastic.

               This  occurs  as  the  price  elasticity  of  demand  approaches  infinity  and  the  demand  curve
               becomes  horizontal,  reflecting  the  fact  that  very  small  changes  in  the  price  lead  to  huge
               changes in the quantity demanded. Finally, if you have trouble keeping straight the terms elastic
               and inelastic, here’s a memory trick for you: Inelastic curves, such as in panel (a) of Figure 1,
               look like the letter I. This is not a deep insight, but it might help on your next exam.

               THE ELASTICITY OF SUPPLY
               When we introduced supply from the previous lesson, we noted that producers of a good offer
               to  sell  more  of  it  when  the  price  of  the  good  rises.  To  turn  from  qualitative  to  quantitative
               statements about quantity supplied, we once again use the concept of elasticity.


               THE PRICE ELASTICITY OF SUPPLY AND
               ITS DETERMINANTS
               The law of supply states that higher prices raise the quantity supplied. The price elasticity of
               supply measures how much the quantity supplied responds to changes in the price. Supply of a
               good is said to be elastic if the quantity supplied responds substantially to changes in the price.
               Supply is said to be inelastic if the quantity supplied responds only slightly to changes in the
               price.


                                                             64]]></page><page Index="334"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY             Department of Management

               The price elasticity of supply depends on the flexibility of sellers to change the amount of the
               good they produce. For example, beachfront land has an inelastic supply because it is almost
               impossible to produce more of it. By contrast, manufactured goods, such as books, cars, and
               televisions, have elastic supplies because firms that produce them can run their factories longer
               in response to a higher price.

               In most markets,  a  key  determinant  of  the  price  elasticity  of  supply  is  the  time  period  being
               considered.  Supply  is  usually  more  elastic  in  the  long  run  than  in  the  short  run.  Over  short
               periods of time, firms cannot easily change the size of their factories to make more or less of a
               good.  Thus,  in  the  short  run,  the  quantity  supplied  is  not  very  responsive  to  the  price.  By
               contrast, over longer periods, firms can build new factories or close old ones. In addition, new
               firms  can  enter  a  market,  and  old  firms  can  shut  down.  Thus,  in  the  long  run,  the  quantity
               supplied can respond substantially to price changes.


               COMPUTING THE PRICE ELASTICITY OF SUPPLY
               Now that we have a general understanding about the price elasticity of supply, let’s be more
               precise.  Economists compute  the  price  elasticity  of  supply  as  the  percentage  change  in  the
               quantity supplied divided by the percentage change in the price. That is,

                              Price elasticity of supply = Percentage change in quantity supplied
               .                                                                Percentage change in price

               For example, suppose that an increase in the price of milk from $2.85 to $3.15 a gallon raises
               the  amount  that  dairy  farmers  produce  from  9,000  to  11,000  gallons  per  month.  Using  the
               midpoint method, we calculate the percentage change in price as

                       Percentage change in price = (3.15 – 2.85) / 3.00 × 100 = 10 percent.

               Similarly, we calculate the percentage change in quantity supplied as

               Percentage change in quantity supplied = (11,000 – 9,000) / 10,000 × 100 = 20 percent.

               In this case, the price elasticity of supply is

               Price elasticity of supply = 20 percent = 2.0.
                                            10 percent

               In this example, the elasticity of 2 indicates that the quantity supplied changes proportionately
               twice as much as the price.


               THE VARIETY OF SUPPLY CURVES
               Because the price elasticity of supply measures the responsiveness of quantity supplied to the
               price, it is reflected in the appearance of the supply curve. Figure 5 shows five cases. In the
               extreme case of a zero elasticity, as shown in panel (a), supply is perfectly inelastic, and the
               supply curve is vertical. In this case, the quantity supplied is the same regardless of the price.


                                                             65]]></page><page Index="335"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY             Department of Management
                        Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus  BMGT21: Basic Microeconomics


               As  the  elasticity  rises,  the  supply  curve  gets  flatter,  which  shows  that  the  quantity  supplied
               responds more to changes in the price. At the opposite extreme, shown in panel (e), supply is
               perfectly elastic. This occurs as the price elasticity of supply approaches infinity and the supply
               curve  becomes  horizontal,  meaning  that  very  small  changes  in  the  price  lead  to  very  large
               changes in the quantity supplied.

               In some markets, the elasticity of supply is not constant but varies over the supply curve. Figure
               6 shows a typical case for an industry in which firms have factories with a limited capacity for
               production. For low levels  of quantity supplied, the elasticity of supply is high, indicating that
               firms  respond  substantially  to  changes  in  the  price.  In  this  region,  firms  have  capacity  for
               production that is not being used, such as plants and equipment idle for all or part of the day.

               Small  increases  in  price make  it  profitable  for  firms  to  begin  using  this idle  capacity. As the
               quantity supplied rises, firms begin to reach capacity. Once capacity is fully used, increasing
               production further requires the construction of new plants. To induce firms to incur this extra
               expense, the price must rise substantially, so supply becomes less elastic.

               Figure 6 presents a numerical example of this phenomenon. When the price rises from $3 to $4
               (a 29 percent increase, according to the midpoint method), the quantity supplied rises from 100
               to 200 (a 67 percent increase). Because quantity supplied changes proportionately more than
               the price, the supply curve has elasticity greater than 1. By contrast, when the price rises from
               $12 to $15 (a 22 percent increase), the quantity supplied rises from 500 to 525 (a 5 percent
               increase).  In  this  case,  quantity  supplied  moves  proportionately  less  than  the  price,  so  the
               elasticity is less than 1.

               SUMMARY:

                     The price elasticity of demand measures how much the quantity demanded responds to
                       changes in the price. Demand tends to be more elastic if close substitutes are available,
                       if the good is  a luxury  rather than  a necessity, if the market is narrowly  defined,  or if
                       buyers have substantial time to react to a price change.

                     The  price  elasticity  of  demand  is  calculated  as  the  percentage  change  in  quantity
                       demanded  divided  by  the  percentage  change  in  price.  If  quantity  demanded  moves
                       proportionately less than the price, then the elasticity is less than 1, and demand is said
                       to be inelastic. If quantity demanded moves proportionately more than the price, then the
                       elasticity is greater than 1, and demand is said to be elastic.

                     Total revenue, the total amount paid for a good, equals the price of the good times the
                       quantity sold. For inelastic demand curves, total revenue rises as price rises. For elastic
                       demand curves, total revenue falls as price rises.

                     The income elasticity of demand measures how much the quantity demanded responds
                       to changes in consumers’ income. The cross-price elasticity of demand measures how
                       much the quantity demanded of one good responds to changes in the price of another
                       good.

                     The  price  elasticity  of  supply  measures  how  much  the  quantity  supplied  responds  to
                       changes  in  the  price.  This  elasticity  often  depends  on  the  time  horizon  under
                       consideration. In most markets, supply is more elastic in the long run than in the short
                       run.

                     The price elasticity of supply is calculated as the percentage change in quantity supplied
                       divided by the percentage change in price. If quantity supplied moves proportionately
                       less than the price, then the elasticity is less than 1, and supply is said to be inelastic. If
                       quantity supplied moves proportionately more than the price, then the elasticity is greater
                       than 1, and supply is said to be elastic.

               LESSON: HOW MARKET WORKS - SUPPLY, DEMAND, AND GOVERNMENT
               POLICIES

               Learning Objectives:

               After the completion of the chapter, you should be able to:
               1.  Explain briefly the elasticity and its application
               2.  Solve problems related to elasticity of demand and supply;
               3.  Differentiate price ceiling and price floors
               4.  Explain how price ceiling and price floors affect market outcomes; and
               5.  Identify government policies regarding prices

               Overview:
                       Economists have two roles. As scientists, they develop and test theories to explain the
               world around them. As policy advisers, they use their theories to help change the world for the
               better. The focus of the preceding two lessons has been scientific. We have seen how supply
               and demand determine the price of  a good and the quantity of the good sold. We have  also
               seen how various events shift supply and demand and thereby change the equilibrium price and
               quantity.

                       This lesson offers our first look at policy. Here we analyze various types of government
               policy using  only the tools  of supply  and demand. As you will see, the  analysis yields some
               surprising insights. Policies often have effects that their architects did not intend or anticipate.
               We  begin  by  considering  policies  that  directly  control  prices.  For  example,  rent-control  laws
               dictate  a  maximum  rent  that  landlords  may  charge  tenants.  Minimum-wage  laws  dictate  the
               lowest wage that firms may pay workers. Price controls are usually enacted when policymakers
               believe that the market price of a good or service is unfair to buyers or sellers. Yet, as we will
               see, these policies can generate inequities of their own.

                       After discussing price controls, we consider the impact of taxes. Policymakers use taxes
               to raise revenue for public purposes and to influence market outcomes. Although the prevalence
               of taxes in our economy is obvious, their effects are not. For example, when the government
               levies a tax on the amount that firms pay their workers, do the firms or the workers bear the
               burden of the tax? The answer is not at all clear—until we apply the powerful tools of supply and
               demand.

               Study these terms
               Price Floor - a legal minimum on the on the price at which a good can be sold

               Price Ceiling - a legal maximum on the price at which a good can be sold

               Discussion

               CONTROLS ON PRICES
                       To see how price controls affect market outcomes, let’s look once again at the market for
               ice  cream.  As  we  saw  in  Chapter  4,  if  ice  cream  is  sold  in  a  competitive  market  free  of
               government regulation, the price  of ice cream adjusts to balance supply  and demand: At the
               equilibrium price, the quantity of ice cream that buyers want to buy exactly equals the quantity
               that sellers want to sell. To be concrete, suppose the equilibrium price is $3 per cone.

                       Not everyone may be happy with the outcome of this free-market process. Let’s say the
               American Association of Ice-Cream Eaters complains that the $3 price is too high for everyone
               to enjoy a cone a day (their recommended diet). Meanwhile, the National Organization of Ice-
               Cream Makers complains that the $3 price—the result of “cutthroat competition”—is too low and
               is  depressing  the  incomes  of  its members.  Each  of  these  groups  lobbies  the  government  to
               pass laws that alter the market outcome by directly controlling the price of an ice-cream cone.

                       Because buyers of any good always want a lower price while sellers want a higher price,
               the interests of the two groups conflict. If the Ice-Cream Eaters are successful in their lobbying,
               the  government  imposes  a  legal  maximum  on  the  price  at  which  ice  cream  can  be  sold.
               Because  the  price  is  not  allowed  to  rise  above  this  level,  the  legislated  maximum  is
               called a price ceiling. By contrast, if the Ice  Cream Makers are  successful, the government
               imposes a legal minimum on the price. Because the price cannot fall below this level, the
               legislated minimum is called a  price floor. Let us consider the  effects of these policies in
               turn.

               HOW PRICE CEILINGS AFFECT MARKET OUTCOMES
                       When the government, moved by the complaints and campaign contributions of the Ice-
               Cream Eaters, imposes a price ceiling on the market for ice cream, two outcomes are possible.
               In panel (a) of Figure 1, the government imposes a price ceiling of $4 per cone. In this case,
               because the price that balances supply and demand ($3) is below the ceiling, the price ceiling
               is not binding. Market forces naturally move the economy to the equilibrium, and the price  ceiling
               has no effect on the price or the quantity sold.

                       Panel  (b)  of  Figure  1  shows  the  other,  more  interesting,  possibility.  In  this  case,  the
               government imposes a price ceiling of $2 per cone. Because the equilibrium price of $3 is above
               the price ceiling,  the ceiling is a binding constraint  on the market. The forces of supply
               and demand tend to move the price toward the equilibrium price, but when the market
               price hits the ceiling, it can, by law, rise no further. Thus, the market price equals the price
               ceiling. At this price, the quantity of ice cream demanded (125 cones in the figure) exceeds the
               quantity supplied (75 cones). There is a shortage of ice cream: 50 people who want to buy ice
               cream at the going price are unable to do so.

                       After discussing price controls, we consider the impact of taxes. Policymakers use taxes
               to raise revenue for public purposes and to influence market outcomes. Although the prevalence
               of taxes in our economy is obvious, their effects are not. For example, when the government
               levies a tax on the amount that firms pay their workers, do the firms or the workers bear the
               burden of the tax? The answer is not at all clear—until we apply the powerful tools of supply and
               demand.

                       When a shortage of ice cream develops because of this price ceiling, some mechanism
               for rationing ice cream will naturally develop. The mechanism could be long lines: Buyers who
               are  willing  to  arrive  early  and  wait  in  line  get  a  cone,  but  those  unwilling  to  wait  do  not.
               Alternatively,  sellers could  ration ice cream according to their  own personal  biases,  selling it
               only  to  friends,  relatives,  or  members  of  their  own  racial  or  ethnic  group.  Notice  that  even
               though the price ceiling was motivated by a desire to help buyers of ice cream, not all buyers
               benefit from the policy. Some buyers do get to pay a lower price, although they may have to
               wait in line to do so, but other buyers cannot get any ice cream at all.

                       This  example  in  the  market  for  ice  cream  shows  a  general  result:  When  the
               government imposes a binding price ceiling on a competitive market, a shortage of the
               good  arises,  and  sellers  must  ration  the  scarce  goods  among  the  large  number  of
               potential  buyers.  The  rationing  mechanisms  that  develop  under  price  ceilings  are  rarely
               desirable. Long lines are inefficient because they waste buyers’ time. Discrimination according
               to seller bias is both inefficient (because the good does not necessarily  go to the buyer who
               values  it  most  highly)  and  potentially  unfair.  By  contrast,  the  rationing  mechanism  in  a  free,
               competitive market is both efficient and impersonal. When the market for ice cream reaches its
               equilibrium, anyone who wants to pay the market price can get  a cone. Free markets  ration
               goods with prices.

               HOW PRICE FLOORS AFFECT MARKET OUTCOMES
                       To examine the effects of  another kind  of government price control, let’s return to the
               market  for  ice  cream.  Imagine  now  that  the  government  is  persuaded  by  the  pleas  of  the
               National Organization of Ice-Cream Makers. In this case, the government might institute a price
               floor. Price floors, like price ceilings, are an attempt by the government to maintain prices
               at  other  than  equilibrium  levels.  Whereas  a  price  ceiling  places  a  legal  maximum  on
               prices, a price floor places a legal minimum.

                       When the government imposes a price floor on the ice-cream market, two outcomes are
               possible. If the government imposes a price floor of $2 per cone when he equilibrium price is $3,
               we obtain the outcome in panel (a) of Figure 4. In this case, because the equilibrium price is
               above the floor, the price floor is not binding. Market forces naturally move the economy to the
               equilibrium, and the price floor has no effect.

                       Panel (b) of Figure 4 shows what happens when the government imposes a price floor of
               $4 per cone. In this case, because the equilibrium price of $3 is below the floor, the price floor is
               a binding constraint on the market. The forces of supply and demand tend to move the price
               toward the equilibrium price, but when the market price hits the floor, it can fall no further. The
               market price equals the price floor. At this floor, the quantity of ice cream supplied (120 cones)
               exceeds the quantity demanded (80 cones). Some people who want to  sell ice cream at the
               going price are unable to. Thus, a binding price floor causes a surplus.

                       Just  as  the  shortages  resulting  from  price  ceilings  can  lead  to  undesirable  rationing
               mechanisms, so can the surpluses resulting from price floors. In the case of a price floor, some
               sellers  are  unable  to  sell  all  they  want  at  the  market  price.  The  sellers  who  appeal  to  the
               personal biases of the buyers, perhaps due to racial or familial ties, are better able to sell their
               goods than those who do not. By contrast, in a free market, the price serves as the rationing
               mechanism, and sellers can sell all they want at the equilibrium price.


               CASE STUDY:  THE MINIMUM WAGE

                       An important example of a price floor is the minimum wage. Minimum-wage laws dictate the
               lowest price for labor that any employer may pay. The U.S. Congress first instituted a minimum wage
               with the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to ensure workers a minimally adequate standard of living. In
               2007, the minimum wage according to federal law was $5.15 per hour, and it was scheduled to increase
               to $7.25 by 2010. (Some states mandate minimum wages above the federal level.)


                                                             72]]></page><page Index="342"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY             Department of Management
                        Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus  BMGT21: Basic Microeconomics


                       Most European nations have minimum-wage laws as well; some, such as France and the United
               Kingdom,  have  significantly  higher  minimums  than  the  United  States.  To  examine  the  effects  of  a
               minimum wage, we must consider the market for labor. Panel (a) of Figure 5 shows the labor market,
               which, like all markets, is subject to the forces of supply and demand. Workers determine the supply of
               labor, and firms determine the demand. If the government doesn’t intervene, the wage normally adjusts
               to balance labor supply and labor demand.

                       Panel (b) of Figure 5 shows the labor market with a minimum wage. If the minimum wage is
               above the equilibrium level, as it is here, the quantity of labor supplied exceeds the quantity demanded.
               The result is unemployment. Thus, the minimum wage raises the incomes of those workers who have
               jobs, but it lowers the incomes of workers who cannot find jobs.

                       To fully understand the minimum wage, keep in mind that the economy contains not a single
               labor market but many labor markets for different types of workers. The impact of the minimum wage
               depends on the skill and experience of the worker. Workers with high skills and much experience are not
               affected because their equilibrium wages are well above the minimum. For these workers, the minimum
               wage is not binding.

                       The minimum wage has its greatest impact on the market for teenage labor. The equilibrium
               wages  of  teenagers  are  low  because  teenagers  are  among  the  least  skilled  and  least  experienced
               members of the labor force. In addition, teenagers are often willing to accept a lower wage in exchange
               for  on-the-job  training.  (Some  teenagers  are  willing  to  work  as  “interns”  for  no  pay  at  all.  Because
               internships pay nothing, however, the minimum wage does not apply to them. If it did, these jobs might
               not exist.) As a result, the minimum wage is more often binding for teenagers than for other members
               of the labor force.

                       Many  economists  have  studied  how  minimum-wage  laws  affect  the  teenage  labor  market.
               These researchers compare the changes in the minimum wage over time with the changes in teenage
               employment. Although there is some debate about how much the minimum wage affects employment,
               the typical study finds that a 10 percent increase in the minimum wage depresses teenage employment
               between 1 and 3 percent. In interpreting this estimate, note that a 10 percent increase in the minimum
               wage does not raise the average wage of teenagers by 10 percent. A change in the law does not directly
               affect those teenagers who are already paid well above the minimum, and enforcement of minimum-
               wage laws is not perfect. Thus, the estimated drop in employment of 1 to 3 percent is significant.

                       In addition to altering the quantity of labor demanded, the minimum wage alters the quantity
               supplied. Because the minimum wage raises the wage that teenagers can earn, it increases the number
               of teenagers who choose to look for jobs. Studies have found that a higher minimum wage influences
               which teenagers are employed. When the minimum wage rises, some teenagers who are still attending
               school choose to drop out and take jobs. These new dropouts displace other teenagers who had already
               dropped out of school and who now become unemployed.

                       The minimum wage is a frequent topic of debate. Economists are about evenly divided on the
               issue. In a 2006 survey of PhD economists, 47 percent favored eliminating the minimum wage, while 14
               percent would maintain it at its current level and 38 percent would increase it.

                       Advocates of the minimum wage view the policy as one way to raise the income of the working
               poor.  They  correctly  point  out  that workers  who  earn  the  minimum  wage  can  afford  only a meager
               standard  of  living.  In  2007,  for  instance,  when  the  minimum  wage  was  $5.15  per  hour,  two  adults
               working 40 hours a week for every week of the year at minimum-wage jobs had a total annual income
               of only $21,424, which was less than half of the median family income. Many advocates of the minimum
               wage  admit  that  it  has  some  adverse  effects,  including  unemployment,  but  they  believe  that  these
               effects are small and that, all things considered, a higher minimum wage makes the poor better off.

                       Opponents of the minimum wage contend that it is not the best way to combat poverty. They
               note that a high minimum wage causes unemployment, encourages teenagers to drop out of school,
               and  prevents  some  unskilled  workers  from  getting  the  on-the-job  training  they  need.  Moreover,
               opponents of the minimum wage point out that it is a poorly targeted policy. Not all minimum-wage
               workers are heads of households trying to help their families escape poverty. In fact, fewer than a third
               of minimum-wage earners are in families with incomes below the poverty line. Many are teenagers from
               middle-class homes working at part-time jobs for extra spending money. ●




































               EVALUATING PRICE CONTROLS
                       One  of  the  Ten  Principles  of  Economics  discussed  in  Chapter  1  is  that  markets  are
               usually  a  good  way  to  organize  economic  activity.  This  principle  explains  why  economists
               usually  oppose price ceilings  and price floors. To  economists, prices are not the  outcome  of
               some haphazard process. Prices, they contend, are the result of the millions of business and
               consumer decisions that lie behind the supply and demand curves. Prices have the crucial job

                                                             74]]></page><page Index="344"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY             Department of Management

               of  balancing  supply  and  demand  and,  thereby,  coordinating  economic  activity.  When
               policymakers  set  prices  by  legal  decree,  they  obscure  the  signals  that  normally  guide  the
               allocation of society’s resources.

                       Another  one  of  the  Ten  Principles  of Economics  is  that  governments  can  sometimes
               improve market outcomes. Indeed, policymakers are led to control prices because they view the
               market’s outcome as unfair. Price controls are often aimed at helping the poor. For instance,
               rent-control laws try to make housing affordable for everyone, and minimum-wage laws try to
               help people escape poverty.

                       Yet price controls often hurt those they are trying to help. Rent control may keep rents
               low, but it also discourages landlords from maintaining their buildings and makes housing hard
               to find. Minimum-wage laws may raise the incomes of some workers, but they also cause other
               workers to be unemployed.

                       Helping those in need can be accomplished in ways other than controlling prices. For
               instance, the government can make housing more affordable by paying a fraction of the rent for
               poor  families.  Unlike  rent  control,  such  rent  subsidies  do  not  reduce  the  quantity  of  housing
               supplied and, therefore, do not lead to housing shortages. Similarly, wage subsidies raise the
               living standards of the working poor without discouraging firms from hiring them. An example of
               a wage subsidy is the earned income tax credit, a government program that supplements the
               incomes of low-wage workers.

                       Although  these  alternative  policies  are  often  better  than  price  controls,  they  are  not
               perfect. Rent and wage subsidies cost the government money  and, therefore, require higher
               taxes. As we see in the next section, taxation has costs of its own.


               QUICK QUIZ Define price ceiling and price floor and give an example of each.
               Which leads to a shortage? Which leads to a surplus? Why?

               TAXES

                       All  governments—from  the  federal  government  in  Washington,  D.C.,  to  the  local
               governments  in  small  towns—use  taxes  to  raise  revenue  for  public  projects,  such  as  roads,
               schools,  and  national  defense.  Because  taxes  are  such  an  important  policy  instrument,  and
               because  they  affect  our  lives  in  many  ways,  we  return  to  the  study  of  taxes  several  times
               throughout this book.

                       In this section, we begin our study of how taxes affect the economy. To set the stage for
               our  analysis,  imagine  that  a  local  government  decides  to  hold  an  annual  ice-cream
               celebration—with a parade, fireworks, and speeches by town officials. To raise revenue to pay
               for the event, the town decides to place a $0.50 tax on the sale of ice-cream cones. When the
               plan is announced, our two lobbying groups swing into action. The American Association of Ice-
               Cream Eaters claims that consumers of ice cream are having trouble making ends meet, and it
               argues that sellers of ice cream should pay the tax. The National Organization  of Ice-Cream
               Makers claims that its members are struggling to survive in a competitive market, and it argues


                                                             75]]></page><page Index="345"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY             Department of Management

               that buyers of ice cream should pay the tax. The town mayor, hoping to reach a compromise,
               suggests that half the tax be paid by the buyers and half be paid by the sellers.

                       To analyze these proposals, we need to address a simple but subtle question: When the
               government  levies  a  tax  on  a  good,  who  actually  bears  the  burden  of  the  tax?  The  people
               buying the good? The people selling the good? Or if buyers and sellers share the tax burden,
               what determines how the burden is divided? Can the government simply legislate the division of
               the  burden,  as  the  mayor  is  suggesting,  or  is  the  division  determined  by  more  fundamental
               market forces? The term tax incidence refers to how the burden of a tax is distributed among
               the various people who make up the economy. As we will see, some surprising lessons about
               tax incidence can be learned by applying the tools of supply and demand.

               HOW TAXES ON SELLERS AFFECT MARKET OUTCOMES
                       We  begin  by  considering  a  tax  levied  on  sellers  of  a  good.  Suppose  the  local
               government passes a law requiring sellers of ice-cream cones to send $0.50 to the government
               for  each  cone  they  sell.  How  does  this  law  affect  the  buyers  and  sellers  of  ice  cream?  To
               answer  this  question,  we  can  follow  the  three  steps  in  Chapter  4  for  analyzing  supply  and
               demand:  (1) We  decide  whether  the  law  affects  the  supply  curve  or  demand  curve.  (2) We
               decide which way the curve shifts. (3) We examine how the shift affects the equilibrium price
               and quantity.

               Step One The immediate impact of the tax is on the sellers of ice cream. Because the tax is not
               levied on buyers, the quantity of ice cream demanded at any given price is the same; thus, the
               demand curve does not change. By contrast, the tax on sellers makes the ice-cream business
               less profitable at any given price, so it shifts the supply curve.

               Step Two  Because  the  tax  on  sellers  raises  the  cost  of  producing  and  selling  ice  cream,  it
               reduces the quantity supplied at every price. The supply curve shifts to the left (or, equivalently,
               upward).

                       We can, in this case, be precise about how much the curve shifts. For any market price
               of ice cream, the effective price to sellers—the amount they get to keep after paying the tax—is
               $0.50 lower.

               For example, if the market price of a cone happened to be $2.00, the effective price received by
               sellers would be $1.50. Whatever the market price, sellers will supply a quantity of ice cream as
               if the price were $0.50 lower than it is. Put differently, to induce sellers  to supply  any given
               quantity, the market price must now be $0.50 higher to compensate for the  effect of the tax.
               Thus, as shown in Figure 6, the supply curve shifts upward from S1 to S2 by the exact size of
               the tax ($0.50)

               Step Three Having determined how the supply curve shifts, we can now compare the initial and
               the new equilibriums. The figure shows that the equilibrium price of ice cream rises from $3.00
               to $3.30, and the equilibrium quantity falls from 100 to 90 cones. Because sellers sell less and
               buyers buy less in the new equilibrium, the tax reduces the size of the ice-cream market.

               Implications We can now return to the question of tax incidence: Who pays the tax? Although
               sellers send the entire tax to the government, buyers and sellers share the burden. Because the

                                                             76]]></page><page Index="346"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY             Department of Management
                        Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus  BMGT21: Basic Microeconomics


               market price rises from $3.00 to $3.30 when the tax is introduced, buyers pay $0.30 more for
               each  ice-cream  cone  than  they  did  without  the  tax.  Thus,  the  tax  makes  buyers  worse  off.
               Sellers get a higher price ($3.30)from buyers than they did previously, but the effective price
               after paying the tax falls from $3.00 before the tax to $2.80 with the tax ($3.30 – $0.50 = $2.80).
               Thus, the tax also makes sellers worse off.

               To sum up, the analysis yields two lessons:
               •  Taxes  discourage  market  activity. When  a  good  is  taxed,  the  quantity  of  the  good  sold  is
               smaller in the new equilibrium.
               • Buyers and sellers share the burden of taxes. In the new equilibrium, buyers pay more for the
               good, and sellers receive less.


               HOW TAXES ON BUYERS AFFECT MARKET OUTCOMES
                       Now  consider  a  tax  levied  on  buyers  of  a  good.  Suppose  that  our  local  government
               passes a law requiring buyers of ice-cream cones to send $0.50 to the government for each ice-
               cream cone they buy. What are the effects of this law? Again, we apply our three steps.

               Step One The initial impact of the tax is on the demand for ice cream. The supply curve is not
               affected because, for any given price of ice cream, sellers have the same incentive to provide
               ice cream to the market. By contrast, buyers now have to pay a tax to the government (as well
               as the price to the sellers) whenever they buy ice cream. Thus, the tax shifts the demand curve
               for ice cream.

               Step  Two We  next  determine  the  direction  of  the  shift.  Because  the  tax  on  buyers  makes
               buying ice cream less attractive, buyers demand a smaller quantity of ice cream at every price.
               As a result, the demand curve shifts to the left (or, equivalently, downward), as shown in Figure
               7.

                       Once again, we can be precise about the magnitude of the shift. Because of the $0.50
               tax levied  on buyers, the effective price to buyers is now $0.50 higher than the market price
               (whatever the market price happens to be). For example, if the market price of a cone happened
               to be $2.00, the effective price to buyers would be $2.50. Because buyers look at their total cost
               including the tax, they demand a quantity of ice cream as if the market price were $0.50 higher
               than it actually is.

                       In other words, to induce buyers to demand any given quantity, the market price must
               now be $0.50 lower to make up for the effect of the tax. Thus, the tax shifts the demand curve
               downward from D1 to D2 by the exact size of the tax ($0.50).

               Step Three Having determined how the demand curve shifts, we can now see the effect of the
               tax by comparing the initial equilibrium and the new equilibrium. You can see in the figure that
               the equilibrium price of ice cream falls from $3.00 to $2.80 and the equilibrium quantity falls from
               100 to 90 cones. Once again, the tax on ice cream reduces the size of the ice-cream market.
               And once again, buyers and sellers share the burden of the tax. Sellers get a lower price for
               their  product;  buyers  pay  a  lower  market  price  to  sellers  than  they  did  previously,  but  the
               effective price (including the tax buyers have to pay) rises from $3.00 to $3.30.

               Implications If you compare Figures 6  and 7, you will notice a surprising conclusion: Taxes
               levied on sellers and taxes levied on buyers are equivalent. In both cases, the tax places a
               wedge between the price that buyers pay and the price that sellers receive. The wedge between
               the buyers’ price and the sellers’ price is the same, regardless of whether the tax is levied on
               buyers or sellers. In either case, the wedge shifts the relative position of the supply and
               demand curves. In the new equilibrium, buyers and sellers share the burden of the tax.
               The  only  difference  between  taxes  on  sellers  and  taxes  on  buyers  is  who  sends  the
               money to the government.

                       The  equivalence  of  these  two  taxes  is  easy  to  understand  if  we  imagine  that  the
               government collects the $0.50 ice-cream tax in a bowl on the counter of each ice cream store.
               When the government levies the tax on sellers, the seller is required to place $0.50 in the bowl
               after  the  sale  of  each  cone.  When  the  government  levies  the  tax  on  buyers,  the  buyer  is
               required to place $0.50 in the bowl every time a cone is bought. Whether the $0.50 goes directly
               from the buyer’s pocket into the bowl, or indirectly from the buyer’s pocket into the seller’s hand
               and then into the bowl, does not matter. Once the market reaches its new equilibrium, buyers
               and sellers share the burden, regardless of how the tax is levied.

               CONCLUSION
               The economy is governed by two kinds of laws: the laws of supply and demand and the laws
               enacted by governments. In this chapter, we have begun to see how these laws interact. Price
               controls  and  taxes  are  common  in  various  markets  in  the  economy,  and  their  effects  are
               frequently  debated  in  the  press  and  among  policymakers.  Even  a  little  bit  of  economic
               knowledge can go a long way toward understanding and evaluating these policies.

               The basic lessons of this chapter will not change: When analyzing government policies, supply
               and demand are the first and most useful tools of analysis.

               WEEK 9

               LESSON:  MARKETS AND WELFARE - Consumers, Producers and the Efficiency
               of Markets

               Learning Objectives:

               After the completion of the chapter, you should be able to:

               1.  Distinguish market efficiency and market failure
               2.  Explain consumer and producer surplus


               Overview:
                       When consumers go to grocery stores to buy their turkeys for Thanksgiving dinner, they
               may be disappointed that the price of turkey is as high as it is. At the same time, when farmers
               bring to market the turkeys they have raised, they wish the price of turkey were even higher.
               These views are not surprising: Buyers always want to pay less, and sellers always want to be
               paid more. But is there a “right price” for turkey from the standpoint of society as a whole?
                       In  previous  lessons,  we  saw  how,  in  market  economies,  the  forces  of  supply  and
               demand  determine  the  prices  of  goods  and  services  and  the  quantities  sold.  So  far,
               however,  we  have  described  the  way  markets  allocate  scarce  resources  without  directly
               addressing the question of whether these market allocations are desirable. In other words, our
               analysis has been positive (what is) rather than normative (what should be). We know that
               the price of turkey adjusts to ensure that the quantity of turkey supplied equals the quantity of
               turkey demanded. But at this equilibrium, is the quantity of turkey produced and consumed too
               small, too large, or just right?

                       In  this  lesson,  we  take  up  the  topic  of  welfare  economics,  the  study  of  how  the
               allocation of resources affects economic well-being. We begin by examining the benefits
               that buyers and sellers receive from taking part in a market. We then examine how society can
               make these benefits as large  as possible. This analysis leads to  a profound conclusion: The
               equilibrium of supply and demand in a market maximizes the total benefits received by buyers
               and sellers.

                       As you may recall from Lesson 1, one of the Ten Principles of Economics is that markets
               are  usually  a  good  way  to  organize  economic  activity.  The  study  of  welfare  economics
               explains this principle more fully. It also answers our question about the right price of turkey:
               The price that balances the supply and demand for turkey is, in a particular sense, the best one
               because it maximizes the total welfare of turkey consumers and turkey producers. No consumer
               or producer of turkeys aims to achieve this goal, but their joint action directed by market prices
               moves them toward a welfare-maximizing outcome, as if led by an invisible hand.

               Discussion

                CONSUMER SURPLUS


               We  begin  our  study  of  welfare  economics  by  looking  at  the  benefits  buyers  receive  from
               participating in a market.

               WILLINGNESS TO PAY
                       Imagine that you own a mint-condition recording of Elvis Presley’s first album. Because
               you are not an Elvis Presley fan, you decide to sell it. One way to do so is to hold an auction.

                       Four Elvis fans show up for your auction: John, Paul, George, and Ringo. Each of them
               would like to own the album, but there is a limit to the amount that each is willing to pay for it.
               Table  1  shows  the  maximum  price  that  each  of  the  four  possible  buyers  would  pay.  Each
               buyer’s  maximum  is  called  his  willingness  to  pay,  and  it  measures  how  much  that  buyer
               values  the  good.  Each  buyer  would  be  eager  to  buy  the  album  at  a  price  less  than  his
               willingness to pay, and he would refuse to buy the album at a price greater than his willingness
               to pay. At a price equal to his willingness to pay, the buyer would be indifferent about buying the
               good: If the price is exactly the same as the value he places on the album, he would be equally
               happy buying it or keeping his money.

                       To  sell  your  album,  you  begin  the  bidding  at  a  low  price,  say,  $10.  Because  all  four
               buyers are willing to pay much more, the price rises quickly. The bidding stops when John bids
               $80 (or slightly more). At this point, Paul, George, and Ringo have dropped out of the bidding
               because they are unwilling to bid any more than$80. John pays you $80 and gets the album.
               Note that the album has gone to the buyer who values the album most highly.













                       What benefit does John receive from buying the Elvis Presley album? In a sense, John
               has found a real bargain: He is willing to pay $100 for the album but pays only $80 for it. We say
               that John receives consumer surplus of $20. Consumer surplus is the amount a buyer is willing
               to pay for a good minus the amount the buyer actually pays for it.

                       Consumer  surplus  measures  the  benefit  buyers  receive  from  participating  in  a
               market. In this example, John receives a $20 benefit from participating in the auction because
               he pays  only $80  for  a good he  values  at $100. Paul, George,  and Ringo get no consumer
               surplus from participating in the auction because they left without the album and without paying
               anything.




                                                             82]]></page><page Index="352"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY             Department of Management
                        Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus  BMGT21: Basic Microeconomics


                       Now consider a somewhat different example. Suppose that you had two identical Elvis
               Presley albums to sell. Again, you auction them off to the four possible buyers. To keep things
               simple, we assume that both albums are to be sold for the same price  and that no buyer is
               interested in buying more than one album. There-fore, the price rises until two buyers are left.

                       In this case, the bidding stops when John and Paul bid $70 (or slightly higher).  At this
               price, John and Paul are each happy to buy an album, and George and Ringo are not willing to
               bid any higher. John and Paul each receive consumer surplus equal to his willingness to pay
               minus the price. John’s consumer surplus is $30, and Paul’s is $10. John’s consumer surplus is
               higher now than in the previous example because he gets the same album but pays less for it.
               The total consumer surplus in the market is $40.

               Consumer Surplus - the amount a buyer is willing to pay for a good minus the amount
               the buyer actually pays for it.

               USINGTHE DEMAND CURVE TO MEASURE
               CONSUMER SURPLUS

                       Consumer surplus is closely related to the demand curve for a product. To see how they
               are  related,  let’s  continue  our  example  and  consider  the  demand  curve  for  this  rare  Elvis
               Presley album.

                       We begin by using the willingness to pay of the four possible buyers to find the demand
               schedule for the album. The table in Figure 1 shows the demand schedule that corresponds to
               Table 1. If the price is above $100, the quantity demanded in the market is 0 because no buyer
               is willing to pay that much. If the price is between $80 and $100, the quantity demanded is  1
               because only John is willing to pay such a high price. If the price is between $70 and $80, the
               quantity  demanded  is  2  because  both  John  and  Paul  are  willing  to  pay  the  price.  We  can
               continue this analysis for other prices as well. In this way,  the demand schedule is derived
               from the willingness to pay of the four possible buyers.

                       The  graphing  Figure1  shows  the  demand  curve  that  corresponds  to  this  demand
               schedule. Note the relationship between the height of the demand curve and the buyers’
               willingness to pay. At any quantity, the price given by the demand curve shows the willingness
               to pay of the marginal buyer, the buyer who would leave the market first if the price were any
               higher. At a quantity of 4 albums, for instance, the demand curve has a height of $50, the price
               that Ringo (the marginal buyer) is willing to pay for  an album. At a quantity of 3 albums, the
               demand curve has a height of $70, the price that George (who is now the marginal buyer) is
               willing to pay.

                       Because the demand curve reflects buyers’ willingness to pay, we can also use it
               to  measure  consumer  surplus.  Figure  2  uses  the  demand  curve  to  compute  consumer
               surplus in our two examples. In panel (a), the price is $80 (or slightly







                                                             83]]></page><page Index="353"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY             Department of Management

               above), and the quantity demanded is 1. Note that the area above the price and below the
               demand curve equals $20. This amount is exactly the consumer surplus we computed
               earlier when only 1 album is sold.

                        Panel (b) of Figure 2 shows consumer surplus when the price is $70 (or slightly above).
               In this case, the area above the price and below the demand curve equals the total area of the
               two rectangles: John’s consumer surplus at this price is $30 and Paul’s is $10. This area equals
               a total of $40. Once again, this amount is the consumer surplus we computed earlier.

                       The lesson from this example holds for all demand curves: The area below the demand
               curve  and  above  the  price  measures  the  consumer  surplus  in  a  market.  This  is  true
               because  the  height  of  the  demand  curve  measures  the  value  buyers  place  on  the  good,  as
               measured by their willingness to pay for it. The difference between this willingness to pay and
               the  market  price  is  each  buyer’s  consumer  surplus.  Thus,  the  total  area  below  the  demand
               curve and above the price is the sum of the consumer surplus of all buyers in the market for a
               good or service

               HOW A LOWER PRICE RAISES CONSUMER SURPLUS

                       Because buyers always want to pay less for the goods they buy, a lower price makes
               buyers of a good better off. But how much does buyers’ well-being rise in response to a lower
               price? We can use the concept of consumer surplus to answer this question precisely.

                       Figure 3 shows a typical demand curve. You may notice that this curve gradually slopes
               downward instead of taking discrete steps as in the previous two




                                                             84]]></page><page Index="354"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY             Department of Management

               figures. In a market with many buyers, the resulting steps from each buyer dropping out are so
               small that they form, in essence, a smooth curve. Although this curve has a different shape, the
               ideas we have  just developed  still apply: Consumer surplus is the  area  above the price  and
               below the demand curve. In panel (a), consumer surplus at a price of P1 is the area of triangle
               ABC.

                       Now suppose that the price falls from P1 to P2, as shown in panel (b). The consumer
               surplus now equals area ADF. The increase in consumer surplus attributable to the lower price
               is the area BCFD.

                       This increase in consumer surplus is composed  of two parts. First, those buyers who
               were already buying Q1 of the good at the higher price P1 are better off because they now pay
               less. The increase in consumer surplus of existing buyers is the reduction in the amount they
               pay;  it  equals  the  area  of  the  rectangle  BCED.  Second,  some  new  buyers  enter  the  market
               because they are willing to buy the good at the lower price. As a result, the quantity demanded
               in the market increases from Q1 to Q2. The consumer surplus these newcomers receive is the
               area of the triangle CEF.

               WHAT DOES CONSUMER SURPLUS MEASURE?

                       Our goal in developing the concept of consumer surplus is to make judgments about the
               desirability  of  market  outcomes.  Now  that  you  have  seen  what  consumer  surplus  is,  let’s





                                                             85]]></page><page Index="355"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY             Department of Management
                        Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus  BMGT21: Basic Microeconomics


               consider     whether     it   is    a     good     measure      of    economic     well-being.



































               Imagine that you are a policymaker trying to design a good economic system. Would you care
               about the amount of consumer surplus? Consumer surplus, the amount that buyers are willing
               to pay for a good minus the amount they actually pay for it, measures the benefit that buyers
               receive from a good as the buyers themselves perceive it. Thus, consumer surplus is a good
               measure  of  economic  wellbeing  if  policymakers  want  to  respect  the  preferences  of
               buyers.

                       In some circumstances, policymakers might choose not to care about consumer surplus
               because  they  do  not  respect  the  preferences  that  drive  buyer  behavior.  For  example,  drug
               addicts are willing to pay a high price for heroin. Yet we would not say that addicts get a large
               benefit from being able to buy heroin at a low price (even though addicts might say they do).

                       From the standpoint of society, willingness to pay in this instance is not a good measure
               of the buyers’ benefit, and consumer surplus is not a good measure  of  economic well-being,
               because  addicts  are  not  looking  after  their  own  best  interests.  In  most  markets,  however,
               consumer surplus does reflect economic well-being. Economists normally assume that buyers
               are rational when they make decisions. Rational people do the best they can to achieve their
               objectives,  given  their  opportunities.  Economists  also  normally  assume  that  people’s
               preferences should be  respected. In this case, consumers  are the best judges of how much
               benefit they receive from the goods they buy.

               PRODUCER SURPLUS


                       We now turn to the other side  of the market and consider the benefits sellers receive
               from participating in a market. As you will see, our analysis of sellers’ welfare is similar to our
               analysis of buyers’ welfare.
               COST AND THE WILLINGNESS TO SELL

                       Imagine now that you are a homeowner and you want to get your house painted. You
               turn to four  sellers  of painting services: Mary, Frida, Georgia, and Grandma. Each painter is
               willing to do the work for you if the price is right. You decide to take bids from the four painters
               and auction off the job to the painter who will do the work for the lowest price. Each painter is
               willing to take the job if the price she would receive exceeds her cost of doing the work. Here
               the term cost should be interpreted as the painters’ opportunity cost: It includes the painters’
               out-of-pocket expenses (for paint, brushes, and so  on)  as well as the value that the painters
               place on their own time.

                       Table  2  shows  each  painter’s  cost.  Because  a  painter’s  cost  is  the  lowest  price  she
               would accept for her work, cost is a measure of her willingness to sell her services. Each
               painter  would  be  eager  to  sell  her  services  at  a  price  greater  than  her  cost,  and  she  would
               refuse to sell her services at a price less than her cost. At a price exactly equal to her cost, she
               would be indifferent about selling her services: She would be equally happy getting the job or
               using her time and energy for another purpose.

                       When you take bids from the painters, the price might start high, but it quickly falls as the
               painters compete for the job. Once Grandma has bid $600 (or slightly less), she is the sole
               remaining  bidder.  Grandma  is  happy  to  do  the  job  for  this  price  because  her  cost  is  only
               $500.Mary, Frida, and Georgia are unwilling to do the job for less than $600. Note that the job
               goes to the painter who can do the work at the lowest cost. What benefit does Grandma receive
               from getting the job? Because she is willing to do the work for $500 but gets $600 for doing it,
               we say that she receives producer surplus of $100. Producer surplus is the amount a seller
               is  paid  minus  the  cost  of  production.  Producer  surplus  measures  the  benefit  sellers
               receive from participating in a market.

                       Now consider a somewhat different example. Suppose that you have two houses that
               need painting. Again, you auction off the jobs to the four painters. To keep things simple, let’s
               assume that no painter is able to paint both houses and that you will pay the same amount to
               paint each house. Therefore, the price falls until two painters are left.
















                                                             87]]></page><page Index="357"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY             Department of Management

               In this case, the bidding stops when Georgia and Grandma each offer to do the job for a price of
               $800 (or slightly less). Georgia and Grandma are willing to do the work at this price, while Mary
               and Frida are not willing to bid a lower price. At a price of $800, Grandma receives producer
               surplus of $300, and Georgia receives producer surplus of $200. The total producer surplus in
               the market is $500.


               USING THE SUPPLY CURVE TO MEASURE
               PRODUCER SURPLUS

                       Just  as  consumer  surplus  is  closely  related  to  the  demand  curve,  producer
               surplus is closely related to the supply curve. To see how, let’s continue our example. We
               begin by using the costs of the four painters to find the supply schedule for painting services.
               The table in Figure 4 shows the supply schedule that corresponds to the costs in Table 2. If the
               price is below $500, none of the four painters is willing to do the job, so the quantity supplied is
               zero.  If  the  price  is  between  $500  and  $600,  only  Grandma  is  willing  to  do  the  job,  so  the
               quantity supplied is 1.

                        If the price is between $600 and $800, Grandma and Georgia are willing to do the job,
               so the quantity supplied is 2, and so on. Thus, the supply schedule is derived from the costs of
               the four painters. The graph in Figure 4 shows the supply curve that corresponds to this supply
               schedule.  Note  that  the  height  of  the  supply  curve  is  related  to  the  sellers’  costs.  At  any
               quantity, the price given by the supply curve shows the cost of the marginal seller, the
               seller  who  would  leave  the  market  first  if  the  price  were  any  lower.  At  a  quantity  of  4
               houses, for instance, the supply curve has a height of $900, the cost that Mary (the marginal
               seller) incurs to provide her painting services. At a quantity of 3 houses, the supply curve has a
               height of $800, the cost that Frida (who is now the marginal seller) incurs. Because the supply
               curve  reflects  sellers’  costs,  we  can  use  it  to  measure  producer  surplus.  Figure  5  uses  the
               supply curve to compute producer surplus in our two examples. In panel (a), we assume that
               the price is $600. In this case, the quantity supplied is 1. Note that the area below the price and
               above the supply curve equals $100. This amount is exactly the producer surplus we computed
               earlier for Grandma.

                       Panel (b) of Figure 5 shows producer surplus at a price of $800. In this case, the area
               below the price and above the supply curve equals the total area of the two rectangles. This
               area equals $500, the producer surplus we computed earlier for Georgia and Grandma when
               two houses needed painting. The lesson from this example applies to all supply curves:
               The area below the price and above the supply curve measures the producer surplus in a
               market. The logic is straightforward: The height of the  supply curve measures sellers’ costs,
               and  the  difference  between  the  price  and  the  cost  of  production  is  each  seller’s  producer
               surplus. Thus, the total area is the sum of the producer surplus of all sellers.

               HOW A HIGHER PRICE RAISES PRODUCER SURPLUS

                       You will not be surprised to hear that sellers always want to receive a higher price for the
               goods they sell. But how much does sellers’ well-being rise in response to a higher price? The
               concept of producer surplus offers a precise answer to this question.

                       Figure 6 shows a typical upward-sloping supply curve that would arise in a market with
               many sellers. Although this supply curve differs in shape from the previous figure, we measure
               producer surplus in the same way: Producer surplus is the area below the price and above
               the supply curve. In panel (a), the price is  P1, and producer surplus is the  area  of triangle
               ABC.
                       Panel (b) shows what happens when the price rises  from  P1 to P2. Producer surplus
               now equals area ADF. This increase in producer surplus has two parts. First, those sellers who
               were already selling Q1 of the good at the lower price P1 are better off because they now get
               more for what they sell. The increase in producer surplus for existing sellers equals the area of
               the rectangle BCED. Second, some new sellers enter the market because they  are willing to
               produce the good at the higher price, resulting in an increase in the quantity supplied from Q1 to
               Q2. The producer surplus of these newcomers is the area of the triangle CEF.

                       As this analysis shows, we use producer surplus to measure the well-being of sellers in
               much the same way as we use consumer surplus to measure the wellbeing of buyers. Because
               these two measures of economic welfare are so similar, it is natural to use them together. And
               indeed, that is exactly what we do in the next section.

               MARKET EFFICIENCY

                       Consumer surplus and producer surplus are the basic tools that economists use to study
               the welfare of buyers and sellers in a market. These tools can help us address a fundamental
               economic question: Is the allocation of resources determined by free markets desirable?

               THE BENEVOLENT SOCIAL PLANNER
                       To  evaluate  market  outcomes,  we  introduce  into  our  analysis  a  new,  hypothetical
               character called the benevolent social planner. The benevolent social planner is an all-knowing,
               all-powerful, well-intentioned dictator. The planner wants to maximize the economic well-being
               of everyone in society. What should this planner do? Should he just leave buyers and sellers at
               the equilibrium that they reach naturally on their own? Or can he increase economic well-being
               by altering the market outcome in some way?

                       To  answer this question, the planner must first decide how to measure the  economic
               well-being of a society. One possible measure is the sum of consumer and producer surplus,
               which  we  call  total  surplus.  Consumer  surplus  is  the  benefit  that  buyers  receive  from
               participating in a market, and producer surplus is the benefit that sellers receive. It is therefore
               natural to use total surplus as a measure of society’s economic well-being.

                       To  better  understand  this  measure  of  economic  well-being,  recall  how  we  measure
               consumer and producer surplus. We define consumer surplus as


                                                             90]]></page><page Index="360"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY             Department of Management
                        Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus  BMGT21: Basic Microeconomics


               Consumer surplus = Value to buyers – Amount paid by buyers.
               Similarly, we define producer surplus as

               Producer surplus = Amount received by sellers – Cost to sellers.
               When we add consumer and producer surplus together, we obtain

               Total surplus = (Value to buyers – Amount paid by buyers) + (Amount received by sellers – Cost
               to sellers).

               The amount paid by buyers equals the amount received by sellers, so the middle two terms in
               this expression cancel each other. As a result, we can write total surplus as

               Total surplus = Value to buyers – Cost to sellers.

               Total surplus in a market is the total value to buyers of the goods, as measured by their
               willingness  to  pay,  minus  the  total  cost  to  sellers  of  providing  those  goods.  If  an
               allocation  of  resources  maximizes  total  surplus,  we  say  that  the  allocation  exhibits
               efficiency. If an allocation is not efficient, then some of the potential gains from trade among
               buyers and sellers are not being realized. For example, an allocation is inefficient if a good is
               not being produced by the sellers with lowest cost. In this case, moving production from a high-
               cost producer to a low-cost producer will lower the total cost to sellers  and raise total surplus.
               Similarly, an

                                                                                      MARKET EFFICIENCY
                   Efficiency the property of a resource allocation of maximizing the total surplus received by all
                                                                                          members of society

               allocation is inefficient if a good is not being consumed by the buyers who value it most highly.
               In this case, moving consumption of the good from a buyer with a low valuation to a buyer with a
               high valuation will raise total surplus. In addition to efficiency, the social planner might also care
               about equality that is, whether the various buyers and sellers in the market have a similar level
               of economic well-being. In essence, the gains from trade in a market are like a pie to be shared
               among the market participants.

                       The question of efficiency concerns whether the pie is as big as possible. The question
               of equality concerns how the pie is sliced and how the portions are distributed among members
               of society. In this chapter, we concentrate on  efficiency as the social planner’s goal. Keep in
               mind, however, that real policymakers often care about equality as well.

               EVALUATING THE MARKET EQUILIBRIUM
































                       Figure 7 shows consumer and producer surplus when a market reaches the equilibrium
               of supply and demand. Recall that consumer surplus equals the area above the price and under
               the demand curve and producer surplus equals the area below the price and above the supply
               curve. Thus, the total area between the supply and demand curves up to the point of equilibrium
               represents the total surplus in this market.

                       Is  this  equilibrium  allocation  of  resources  efficient?  That  is,  does  it  maximize  total
               surplus?  To  answer  this  question,  recall  that  when  a  market  is  in  equilibrium,  the  price
               determines  which  buyers  and  sellers  participate  in  the  market.  Those  buyers  who  value  the
               good more than the price (represented by the segment AE on the demand curve) choose to buy
               the good; buyers who value it less than the price (represented by the segment EB) do not.

                       Similarly, those sellers whose costs are less than the price (represented by the segment
               CE on the supply curve) choose to produce and sell the good; sellers whose costs are greater
               than the price (represented by the segment ED) do not. These observations lead to two insights
               about market outcomes:

               1. Free markets  allocate the supply  of goods to the buyers who  value them most highly, as
               measured by their willingness to pay.

               2. Free markets allocate the demand for goods to the sellers who can produce them at the least
               cost.






                                                             92]]></page><page Index="362"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY             Department of Management
                        Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus  BMGT21: Basic Microeconomics


                       Thus, given the quantity produced and sold in a market equilibrium, the social planner
               cannot increase economic well-being by changing the allocation of consumption among buyers
               or the allocation of production among sellers.

                       But can the social planner raise total economic well-being by increasing or decreasing
               the  quantity  of  the  good?  The  answer  is  no,  as  stated  in  this  third  insight  about  market
               outcomes:

               3.  Free  markets  produce  the  quantity  of  goods  that  maximizes  the  sum  of  consumer  and
               producer surplus.

































                       Figure 8 illustrates why this is true. To interpret this figure, keep in mind that the demand
               curve  reflects  the  value  to  buyers  and  the  supply  curve  reflects  the  cost  to  sellers.  At  any
               quantity below the equilibrium level, such as Q1, the value to the marginal buyer exceeds the
               cost to the marginal seller. As a result, increasing the quantity produced and consumed raises
               total surplus. This continues to be true until the quantity reaches the equilibrium level. Similarly,
               at any quantity beyond the equilibrium level, such as Q2, the value to the marginal buyer is less
               than the cost to the marginal seller. In this case, decreasing the quantity raises total surplus,
               and  this  continues  to  be  true  until  quantity  falls  to  the  equilibrium  level.  To  maximize  total
               surplus,  the  social  planner  would  choose  the  quantity where  the  supply  and  demand  curves
               intersect.

                       Together,  these  three  insights  tell  us  that  the  market  outcome  makes  the  sum  of
               consumer and producer surplus as large as it can be. In other words, the equilibrium outcome is
               an  efficient  allocation  of  resources.  The  benevolent  social  planner  can,  therefore,  leave  the

               market outcome just as he finds it. This policy of leaving well enough alone goes by the French
               expression laissez faire, which literally translates to “allow them to do.”

                       Society is lucky that the planner doesn’t need to intervene. Although it has been a useful
               exercise imagining what an  all-knowing, all-powerful, well- intentioned dictator would do, let’s
               face it: Such characters are hard to come by. Dictators are rarely benevolent, and even if we
               found someone so virtuous, he would lack crucial information.

                       Suppose  our social planner tried to choose  an  efficient  allocation  of  resources  on his
               own,  instead  of  relying  on  market  forces.  To  do  so,  he  would  need  to  know  the  value  of  a
               particular  good  to  every  potential  consumer  in  the  market  and  the  cost  of  every  potential
               producer. And he would need this information not only for this market but for every one of the
               many thousands of markets in the economy.

                       The  task  is  practically  impossible,  which  explains  why  centrally  planned  economies
               never work very well. The planner’s job becomes easy, however, once he takes on a partner:
               Adam Smith’s invisible hand  of the marketplace. The invisible hand takes  all the information
               about buyers and sellers into account and guides everyone in the market to the best outcome
               as judged by the standard  of  economic efficiency. It is, truly, a remarkable feat. That is why
               economists so often advocate free markets as the best way to organize economic activity.

                CONCLUSION: MARKET EFFICIENCY AND MARKET FAILURE

               This  lesson  introduced  the  basic  tools  of  welfare  economics  consumer  and  producer
               surplus and used them to evaluate the efficiency of free markets. We showed that the
               forces  of  supply  and  demand  allocate  resources  efficiently.  That  is,  even  though  each
               buyer and seller in a market is concerned only about his or her own welfare, they are together
               led by an invisible hand to an equilibrium that maximizes the total benefits to buyers and sellers.

               A word of warning is in order.

                        To  conclude  that  markets  are  efficient,  we  made  several  assumptions  about  how
               markets work. When these assumptions do not hold, our conclusion that the market equilibrium
               is efficient may no longer be true. As we close this lesson, let’s consider briefly two of the most
               important  of  these  assumptions.  First,  our  analysis  assumed  that  markets  are  perfectly
               competitive. In the world, however, competition is sometimes far from perfect. In some
               markets, a single buyer or seller (or a small group of them) may be able to control market
               prices.

                       This ability to  influence prices is called  market power. Market power can cause
               markets  to  be  inefficient  because  it  keeps  the  price  and  quantity  away  from  the
               equilibrium of supply and demand.

                       Second, our analysis assumed that the outcome in a market matters only to the
               buyers and sellers in that market. Yet, in the world, the decisions of buyers and sellers
               sometimes affect people who are not participants  in the market at  all. Pollution is  the
               classic  example.  The  use  of  agricultural  pesticides,  for  instance,  affects  not  only  the
               manufacturers who make them and the farmers who use them, but many others who breathe air

                                                             94]]></page><page Index="364"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY             Department of Management

               or  drink  water  that  has  been  polluted  with  these  pesticides.  Such  side  effects,  called
               externalities,  cause welfare  in  a  market  to  depend  on  more  than just  the  value  to  the
               buyers and the cost to the sellers.  Because buyers and sellers do  not consider these
               side  effects  when  deciding  how  much  to  consume  and  produce,  the  equilibrium  in  a
               market can be inefficient from the standpoint of society as a whole. Market power and
               externalities are examples of a general phenomenon called market failure the inability of
               some  unregulated  markets  to  allocate  resources  efficiently.  When  markets  fail,  public
               policy can potentially remedy the problem and increase economic efficiency.

                        Macroeconomists devote much effort to studying when market failure is likely and what
               sorts of policies are best at correcting market failures. As you continue your study of economics,
               you  will  see  that  the  tools  of  welfare  economics  developed  here  are  readily  adapted  to  that
               endeavor.  Despite  the  possibility  of  market  failure,  the  invisible  hand  of  the  marketplace  is
               extraordinarily important. In many markets, the assumptions we made in this lesson work well,
               and the conclusion of market efficiency applies directly.

                       Moreover, we can use our analysis of welfare economics and market efficiency to shed
               light on the effects of various government policies. In the next two lessons, we apply the tools
               we have just developed to study two important policy issues the welfare effects of taxation and
               of international trade.

               SUMMARY

               •  Consumer  surplus  equals  buyers’  willingness  to  pay  for  a  good  minus  the  amount  they
               actually pay, and it measures the benefit buyers get from participating in a market. Consumer
               surplus can be computed by finding the area below the demand curve and above the price.

               •  Producer  surplus  equals  the  amount  sellers  receive  for  their  goods  minus  their  costs  of
               production,  and  it  measures  the  benefit  sellers  get  from  participating  in  a  market.  Producer
               surplus can be computed by finding the area below the price and above the supply curve.

               • An allocation of resources that maximizes the sum of consumer and producer surplus is said
               to be efficient. Policymakers are often concerned with the efficiency, as well as the equality, of
               economic outcomes.


               • The equilibrium of supply and demand maximizes the sum of consumer and producer surplus.
               That is, the invisible hand  of the marketplace leads buyers  and sellers to  allocate resources
               efficiently.

               • Markets do not allocate resources efficiently in the presence of market failures such as market
               power or externalities.

               WEEK 10

               LESSON: THE ECONOMICS OF THE PUBLIC SECTOR - EXTERNALITIES

               Learning Objectives:

               After the completion of the chapter, you should be able to:
               1.  Describe externalities
               2.  Explain market inefficiency;
               3.  Enumerate some government solution to externalities

               Overview:


               Externalities
                       Firms  that  make  and  sell  paper  also  create,  as  a  by-product  of  the  manufacturing
               process, a chemical called dioxin. Scientists believe that once dioxin enters the environment, it
               raises the population’s risk of cancer, birth defects, and other health problems.

                       Is  the  production  and  release  of  dioxin  a  problem  for  society?,  we  examined  how
               markets allocate scarce resources with the forces of supply and demand, and we saw that the
               equilibrium of supply and demand is typically an efficient allocation of resources. To use Adam
               Smith’s famous metaphor, the “invisible hand” of the marketplace leads  self-interested buyers
               and sellers in a market to maximize the total benefit that society derives from that market. This
               insight is the basis for one of the Ten Principles of Economics

                       Markets  are  usually  a  good  way  to  organize  economic  activity. Should  we  conclude,
               therefore,  that  the  invisible  hand  prevents  firms  in  the  paper  market  from  emitting too  much
               dioxin? Markets do many things well, but they do not do everything well. In this lesson, we begin
               our  study of  another  of the  Ten Principles of Economics: Government action can sometimes
               improve upon market outcomes. We examine why markets sometimes fail to allocate resources
               efficiently, how government policies can potentially improve the market’s  allocation, and what
               kinds of policies are likely to work best.

               Discussion

               WELFARE ECONOMICS: A RECAP

               .
                       To make our analysis concrete, we consider a specific market the market for aluminum.
               Figure 1 shows the supply and demand curves in the market for aluminum.

                       The supply and demand curves contain important information about costs and benefits.
               The demand curve for aluminum reflects the value of aluminum to consumers, as measured by
               the prices they are willing to pay. At any given quantity, the height of the demand curve shows
               the willingness to pay of the marginal buyer. In other words, it shows the value to the consumer
               of the last unit of aluminum bought. Similarly, the supply curve reflects the costs of producing




                                                             97]]></page><page Index="367"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY             Department of Management

               aluminum. At any given quantity, the height of the supply curve shows the cost of the marginal
               seller. In other words, it shows the cost to the producer of the last unit of aluminum sold.

                       In the absence of government intervention, the price adjusts to balance the supply and
               demand for aluminum. The quantity produced and consumed in the market equilibrium, shown
               as QMARKET in Figure 1, is efficient in the sense that it maximizes the sum of producer and
               consumer surplus. That is, the market allocates resources in  a way that maximizes the total
               value to the consumers who buy and use aluminum minus the total costs to the producers who
               make and sell aluminum.



























               NEGATIVE EXTERNALITIES

                       Now  let’s  suppose  that  aluminum  factories  emit  pollution:  For  each  unit  of  aluminum
               produced,  a certain  amount of smoke  enters the  atmosphere. Because this smoke creates  a
               health risk for those who breathe the air, it is a negative externality. How does this externality
               affect the efficiency of the market outcome?

                       Because of the externality, the cost to society of producing aluminum is larger than the
               cost to the aluminum producers. For each unit of aluminum produced, the social cost includes
               the  private  costs  of  the  aluminum  producers  plus  the  costs  to  those  bystanders  affected
               adversely by the pollution.















                                                             98]]></page><page Index="368"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY             Department of Management
                        Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus  BMGT21: Basic Microeconomics






























                       Figure 2 shows the social cost of producing aluminum. The social-cost curve is above
               the  supply  curve  because  it  takes  into  account  the  external  costs  imposed  on  society  by
               aluminum producers. The difference between these two curves reflects the cost of the pollution
               emitted.

                       What  quantity  of  aluminum  should  be  produced?  To  answer  this  question,  we  once
               again consider what a benevolent social planner would do. The planner wants to maximize the
               total surplus derived from the market the value to consumers  of  aluminum minus the cost of
               producing aluminum. The planner understands, however, that the cost of producing aluminum
               includes the external costs of the pollution.

                       The planner would choose the level of aluminum production at which the demand curve
               crosses  the  social-cost  curve.  This  intersection  determines  the  optimal  amount  of  aluminum
               from  the  standpoint  of  society  as  a  whole.  Below  this  level  of  production,  the  value  of  the
               aluminum to consumers (as measured by the height of the demand curve) exceeds the social
               cost of producing it (as measured by the height of the social-cost curve). The planner does not
               produce more than this level because the social cost of producing additional aluminum exceeds
               the value to consumers.

                       Note that the  equilibrium quantity of  aluminum,  QMARKET, is larger than the socially
               optimal quantity, QOPTIMUM. This inefficiency occurs because the market equilibrium reflects
               only the private costs of production. In the market equilibrium, the marginal consumer values
               aluminum at less than the social cost of producing it. That is, at QMARKET, the demand curve
               lies below the social-cost curve. Thus, reducing aluminum production and consumption below
               the market equilibrium level raises total economic well-being.

                       How  can  the  social  planner  achieve  the  optimal  outcome?  One  way  would  be  to  tax
               aluminum producers  for  each ton of  aluminum sold. The tax would shift  the supply curve  for
               aluminum  upward  by  the  size  of  the  tax.  If  the  tax  accurately  reflected  the  external  cost  of


                                                             99]]></page><page Index="369"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY             Department of Management
                        Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus  BMGT21: Basic Microeconomics


               smoke released into the atmosphere, the new supply curve would coincide with the social-cost
               curve. In the new market equilibrium, aluminum producers would produce the socially optimal
               quantity of aluminum.

                       The use  of such a tax is called  internalizing the externality because it gives buyers
               and sellers in the market an incentive to take into account the external effects of their actions.
               Aluminum producers would, in essence, take the costs of pollution into account when deciding
               how much aluminum to supply because the tax would make them pay for these external costs.
               And,  because  the  market  price  would  reflect  the  tax  on  producers,  consumers  of  aluminum
               would  have  an  incentive  to  use  a  smaller  quantity.  The  policy  is  based  on  one  of  the  Ten
               Principles  of  Economics: People  respond  to  incentives.  Later  in  this  chapter,  we  consider  in
               more detail how policymakers can deal with externalities.

               POSITIVE EXTERNALITIES

                       Although  some  activities  impose  costs  on  third  parties,  others  yield  benefits.  For
               example,  consider  education.  To  a  large  extent,  the  benefit  of  education  is  private:  The
               consumer of education becomes a more productive worker and thus reaps much of the benefit
               in  the  form  of  higher  wages.  Beyond  these  private  benefits,  however,  education  also  yields
               positive externalities. One externality is that a more educated population leads to more informed
               voters,  which  means  better  government  for  everyone.  Another  externality  is  that  a  more
               educated population tends to mean lower crime rates. A third externality is that a more educated
               population  may  encourage  the  development  and  dissemination  of  technological  advances,
               leading  to  higher  productivity  and  wages  for  everyone.  Because  of  these  three  positive
               externalities, a person may prefer to have neighbors who are well educated.

                       The analysis of positive externalities is similar to the analysis of negative externalities.
               As Figure 3 shows, the demand curve does not reflect the value to society of the good. Because
               the social value is greater than the private value, the social value curve lies above the demand
               curve. The optimal quantity is found where the social-value curve and the supply curve (which
               represents  costs)  intersect.  Hence,  the  socially  optimal  quantity  is  greater  than  the  quantity
               determined by the private market.

                       Once  again,  the  government  can  correct  the  market  failure  by  inducing  market
               participants  to  internalize  the  externality.  The  appropriate  response  in  the  case  of  positive
               externalities is exactly the opposite to the case of negative externalities.

                       To  move  the  market  equilibrium  closer  to  the  social  optimum,  a  positive  externality
               requires a subsidy. In fact, that is exactly the policy the government follows: Education is heavily
               subsidized through public schools and government scholarships.

               TECHNOLOGY SPILLOVERS, INDUSTRIAL POLICY,
               AND PATENT PROTECTION

                       A potentially important type of positive externality is called a technology spillover— the
               impact  of  one  firm’s  research  and  production  efforts  on  other  firms’  access  to  technological
               advance. For example, consider the market for industrial robots.

                       Robots  are  at the frontier  of  a rapidly changing technology. Whenever  a firm builds a
               robot, there is some chance that it will discover a new and better design.

                       This  new  design  may  benefit  not  only  this  firm  but  society  as  a  whole  because  the
               design will enter society’s pool of technological knowledge. That is, the new design may have
               positive externalities for other producers in the economy.

                       In this case, the government can internalize the externality by subsidizing the production
               of  robots.  If  the  government  paid  firms  a  subsidy  for  each  robot  produced,  the  supply  curve
               would shift down by the amount of the subsidy, and this shift would increase the  equilibrium
               quantity of robots. To ensure that the market equilibrium equals the social optimum, the subsidy
               should equal the value of the technology spillover.

                       How large are technology spillovers, and what do they imply for public policy? This is an
               important question because technological progress is the key to why living standards rise over
               time. Yet it is also a difficult question on which economists often disagree.

                       Some  economists  believe  that  technology  spillovers  are  pervasive  and  that  the
               government should  encourage those industries that yield the largest spillovers. For instance,
               these  economists  argue  that  if  making  computer  chips  yields  greater  spillovers  than  making
               potato chips, then the government should encourage the production of computer chips relative
               to the production of potato chips. The U.S. tax code does this in a limited way by offering special

                                                            101]]></page><page Index="371"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY             Department of Management

               tax breaks  for  expenditures on research and development. Some other  nations go  further by
               subsidizing  specific  industries  that  supposedly  offer  large  technology  spillovers.  Government
               intervention in the economy that aims to promote technology-enhancing industries is sometimes
               called industrial policy.

                       Other economists are skeptical about industrial policy. Even if technology spillovers are
               common, the success of an industrial policy requires that the government be able to measure
               the size of the spillovers from different markets. This measurement problem is difficult at best.
               Moreover,  without  precise  measurements,  the  political  system  may  end  up  subsidizing
               industries  with  the  most  political  clout  rather  than  those  that  yield  the  largest  positive
               externalities.

                       Another way to deal with technology spillovers is the patent laws protect the rights
               of inventors by giving them exclusive use of their inventions for a period of time. When a firm
               makes a technological breakthrough, it can patent the idea and capture much of the economic
               benefit for itself. The patent internalizes the externality by giving the firm a property right over
               its  invention.  If  other  firms  want  to  use  the  new  technology,  they  would  have  to  obtain
               permission from the inventing firm and pay it some royalty. Thus, the patent system gives firms
               a greater incentive to engage in research and other activities that advance technology.


               PUBLIC POLICIES TOWARD EXTERNALITIES

                       We have discussed why externalities lead markets to allocate resources inefficiently but
               have  mentioned  only  briefly  how  this  inefficiency  can  be  remedied.  In  practice,  both  public
               policymakers  and  private  individuals  respond  to  externalities  in  various  ways.  All  of  the
               remedies share the goal of moving the allocation of resources closer to the social optimum.

                       This section considers governmental solutions. As a general matter, the government can
               respond to  externalities in one  of two ways.  Command-and-control policies  regulate behavior
               directly. Market-based policies provide incentives so that private decision makers will choose to
               solve the problem on their own.

               COMMAND-AND-CONTROL POLICIES: REGULATION

                       The government can remedy an externality by making certain behaviors either required
               or forbidden. For example, it is a crime to dump poisonous chemicals into the water supply. In
               this case, the external costs to society far exceed the benefits to the polluter. The government
               therefore  institutes  a  command-and-control  policy  that  prohibits  this  act  altogether.  In  most
               cases of pollution, however, the situation is not this simple. Despite the stated goals of some
               environmentalists, it would be impossible to prohibit all polluting activity.

               For  example,  virtually  all  forms  of  transportation  even  the  horse  produce  some  undesirable
               polluting by-products. But it would not be sensible for the government to ban all transportation.
               Thus, instead of trying to eradicate pollution entirely, society has to weigh the costs and benefits
               to  decide  the  kinds  and  quantities  of  pollution  it  will  allow.  In  the  United  States,  the


                                                            102]]></page><page Index="372"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY             Department of Management

               Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is the government agency with the task of developing
               and enforcing regulations aimed at protecting the environment. Environmental regulations can
               take many forms. Sometimes the EPA dictates a maximum level of pollution that a factory may
               emit. Other times the EPA requires that firms adopt a particular technology to reduce emissions.
               In all cases, to design good rules, the government regulators need to know the details about
               specific industries and about the alternative technologies that those industries could adopt. This
               information is often difficult for government regulators to obtain.


               MARKET-BASED POLICY 1: CORRECTIVE TAXES AND SUBSIDIES

                       Instead  of  regulating  behavior  in  response  to  an  externality,  the  government can  use
               market-based policies to align private incentives with social efficiency. For instance, as we saw
               earlier,  the  government  can  internalize  the  externality  by  taxing  activities  that  have  negative
               externalities  and  subsidizing  activities  that  have  positive  externalities.  Taxes  enacted  to  deal
               with  the  effects  of  negative  externalities  are  called  corrective  taxes.  They  are  also  called
               Pigovian taxes after economist Arthur Pigou (1877–1959), an early advocate of their use. An
               ideal corrective tax would equal the external cost from an activity with negative externalities,
               and an ideal corrective subsidy would equal the external benefit from an activity with positive
               externalities.

                       Economists usually prefer corrective taxes to regulations as a way to deal with pollution
               because they can reduce pollution at a lower cost to society. To see why, let us consider an
               example. Suppose that two factories—a paper mill and a steel mill—are each dumping 500 tons
               of glop into a river each year. The EPA decides that it wants to reduce the amount of pollution. It
               considers two solutions:

               • Regulation: The EPA could tell each factory to reduce its pollution to 300 tons of glop per year.
               • Corrective tax: The EPA could levy a tax on each factory of $50,000 for each ton of glop it
               emits.

                       The  regulation  would  dictate  a  level  of  pollution,  whereas  the  tax  would  give
               factory owners an economic incentive to reduce pollution. Which solution do you think is
               better?

                       Most economists prefer the tax. To explain this preference, they would first point out that
               a tax is just as effective as a regulation in reducing the overall level of pollution. The EPA
               can achieve whatever level of pollution it wants by setting the tax at the appropriate level. The
               higher the tax, the larger the reduction in pollution. If the tax is high enough, the factories will
               close down altogether, reducing pollution to zero.


                       Although regulation and corrective taxes are both capable of reducing pollution, the tax
               accomplishes this goal more efficiently. The regulation requires each factory to reduce pollution
               by the same amount. An equal reduction, however, is not necessarily the least expensive way to
               clean up the water. It is possible that the paper mill can reduce pollution at lower cost than the
               steel mill. If so, the paper mill would respond to the tax by reducing pollution substantially to


                                                            103]]></page><page Index="373"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY             Department of Management
                        Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus  BMGT21: Basic Microeconomics


               avoid the tax, whereas the steel mill would respond by reducing pollution less and paying the
               tax. In essence, the corrective tax places a price on the right to pollute.

                       Just as markets allocate goods to those buyers who value them most highly, a corrective
               tax allocates pollution to those factories that face the highest cost of reducing it. Whatever the
               level of pollution the EPA chooses, it can achieve this goal at the lowest total cost using a tax.
               Economists  also  argue  that  corrective  taxes  are  better  for  the  environment.  Under  the
               command-and-control policy of regulation, the factories have no reason to reduce emission
               further once they have reached the target of 300 tons of glop.

               By contrast, the tax gives the factories an incentive to develop cleaner technologies because a
               cleaner technology would reduce the amount of tax the factory has to pay. Corrective taxes are
               unlike most other taxes.

               Most  taxes  distort  incentives  and  move  the  allocation  of  resources  away  from  the  social
               optimum. The reduction in economic well-being—that is, in consumer and producer surplus—
               exceeds the amount of revenue the government raises, resulting in a deadweight loss.

               By  contrast,  when  externalities  are  present,  society  also  cares  about  the  well-being  of  the
               bystanders who  are affected. Corrective taxes  alter incentives to account for the presence of
               externalities and thereby move the allocation of resources closer to the social optimum. Thus,
               while corrective taxes raise revenue for the government, they also enhance economic efficiency.

               WHY  IS  GASOLINE  TAXED  SO  HEAVILY?  In  many  nations,  gasoline  is  among  the  most
               heavily taxed goods. The gas tax can be viewed  as a corrective tax aimed  at three negative
               externalities associated with driving:

               •  Congestion:  If  you  have  ever  been  stuck  in  bumper-to-bumper  traffic,  you  have  probably
               wished  that  there  were  fewer  cars  on  the  road.  A  gasoline  tax  keeps  congestion  down  by
               encouraging people to take public transportation, carpool more often, and live closer to work.

               •  Accidents:  Whenever  people  buy  large  cars  or  sport-utility  vehicles,  they  may  make
               themselves  safer  but  they  certainly  put  their  neighbors  at  risk.  According  to  the  National
               Highway Traffic Safety Administration, a person driving a typical car is five times as likely to die
               if hit by a sport-utility vehicle than if hit by another car. The gas tax is an indirect way of making
               people pay when their large, gas-guzzling vehicles impose risk on others, which in turn makes
               them take this risk into account when choosing what vehicle to purchase.

               • Pollution: The burning of fossil fuels such as gasoline is widely believed to be the cause of
               global warming. Experts disagree about how dangerous this threat is, but there is no doubt that
               the gas tax reduces the threat by reducing the use of gasoline.


                       So the gas tax, rather than causing deadweight losses like most taxes, actually makes
               the  economy  work  better.  It  means  less  traffic  congestion,  safer  roads,  and  a  cleaner
               environment.  How  high  should  the  tax  on  gasoline  be?  Most  European  countries  impose

                                                            104]]></page><page Index="374"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY             Department of Management

               gasoline  taxes  that  are  much  higher  than  those  in  the  United  States.  Many  observers  have
               suggested that the United States also should tax gasoline more heavily. A 2007 study published
               in  the  Journal  of  Economic  Literature  summarized  the  research  on  the  size  of  the  various
               externalities associated with driving. It concluded that the optimal corrective tax on gasoline was
               $2.10 per gallon, compared to the actual tax in the United States of 40 cents.

                       The  tax  revenue  from  a  gasoline  tax  could  be  used  to  lower  taxes  that  distort
               incentives and cause deadweight losses. In addition, some of the burdensome government
               regulations  that  require  automakers  to  produce  more  fuel-efficient  cars  would  prove
               unnecessary. This idea, however, has never proven politically popular.

               MARKET-BASED POLICY 2: TRADABLE POLLUTION PERMITS

                       Returning to our example of the paper mill and the steel mill, let us suppose that, despite
               the advice of its economists, the EPA adopts the regulation and requires each factory to reduce
               its pollution to 300 tons of glop per year. Then one day, after the regulation is in place and both
               mills  have  complied,  the  two  firms  go  to  the  EPA  with  a  proposal.  The  steel  mill  wants  to
               increase its emission of glop by 100 tons. The paper mill has agreed to reduce its emission by
               the same amount if the steel mill pays it $5 million. Should the EPA allow the two factories to
               make this deal?


                       From the standpoint of economic efficiency, allowing the deal is good policy. Voluntarily
               agreeing to it. Moreover, the deal does not have any external effects because the total amount
               of pollution remains the same. Thus, social welfare is enhanced by allowing the paper mill to sell
               its pollution rights to the steel mill.
                       The same logic applies to any voluntary transfer of the right to pollute from one firm to
               another. If the EPA allows firms to make these deals, it will,  in essence, have created a new
               scarce resource: pollution permits. A market to trade these permits will eventually develop, and
               that market will be governed by the forces of supply and demand. The invisible hand will ensure
               that this new market allocates the right to pollute efficiently. That is, the permits will end up in
               the hands of those firms that value them most highly, as judged by their willingness to pay.
               A firm’s willingness to pay, in turn, will depend on its cost of reducing pollution: The more costly
               it is for a firm to cut back on pollution, the more it will be willing to pay for a permit.

                       An advantage  of  allowing a market for pollution permits is that the initial allocation  of
               pollution  permits  among  firms  does  not  matter  from  the  standpoint  of  economic  efficiency.
               Those firms that can reduce pollution at a low cost will sell whatever permits they get, and firms
               that can reduce pollution only at a high cost will buy whatever permits they need. As long as
               there is a free market for

                       The  deal  must make  the  owners  of  the  two  factories  better  off  because  they  are  the
               pollution rights, the final allocation will be efficient regardless of the initial allocation. Although
               reducing pollution using pollution permits may seem very different from using corrective taxes,
               the  two  policies  have  much  in  common.  In  both  cases,  firms  pay  for  their  pollution.  With


                                                            105]]></page><page Index="375"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY             Department of Management
                        Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus  BMGT21: Basic Microeconomics


               corrective  taxes,  polluting  firms  must  pay  a  tax  to  the  government.  With  pollution  permits,
               polluting firms must pay to buy the permit. (Even firms that already own permits must pay to
               pollute:  The  opportunity  cost  of  polluting  is  what  they  could  have  received  by  selling  their
               permits  on  the  open  market.)  Both  corrective  taxes  and  pollution  permits  internalize  the
               externality of pollution by making it costly for firms to pollute.

                       The similarity of the two policies can be seen by considering the market for pollution.
               Both panels in Figure 4 show the demand curve for the right to pollute. This curve shows that
               the lower the price of polluting, the more firms will choose to pollute. In panel (a), the EPA uses
               a corrective tax to set a price for pollution. In this case, the supply curve for pollution rights is
               perfectly elastic (because firms can pollute as much as they want by paying the tax), and the
               position of the demand curve determines the quantity of pollution. In panel (b), the EPA sets a
               quantity of pollution by issuing pollution permits. In this case, the supply curve for pollution rights
               is perfectly inelastic (because the quantity of pollution is fixed by the number of permits), and
               the position of the demand curve determines the price of pollution. Hence, the EPA can achieve
               any point on a given demand curve either by setting a price with a corrective tax or by setting a
               quantity with pollution permits.

                       In some circumstances, however, selling pollution permits may be better than levying a
               corrective tax. Suppose the EPA wants no more than 600 tons of glop dumped into the river.
               But because the EPA does not know the demand curve for pollution, it is not sure what size tax
               would achieve that goal. In this case, it can simply auction off 600 pollution permits. The auction
               price would yield the appropriate size of the corrective tax.

                       The idea of the government auctioning off the right to pollute may at first sound like a
               creature  of  some  economist’s  imagination.  And  in  fact,  that  is  how  the  idea  began.  But
               increasingly, the EPA has used the  system as  a way to control pollution. A notable success
               story  has  been  the  case  of  sulfur  dioxide  (SO2)—A  leading  cause  of  acid  rain.  In  1990,
               amendments to the Clean Air Act required power plants to reduce SO2 emissions substantially.
               At  the  same  time,  the  amendments  set  up  a  system  that  allowed  plants  to  trade  their  SO2
               allowances. Although initially both industry representatives and environmentalists were skeptical
               of  the  proposal,  over  time  the  system  has  proved  that  it  can  reduce  pollution  with  minimal
               disruption.

               Pollution permits, like corrective taxes, are now widely viewed as a cost-effective way to keep
               the environment clean.

               OBJECTIONS TO THE ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF POLLUTION

                       “We  cannot  give  anyone  the  option  of  polluting  for  a  fee.”  This  comment  by  former
               Senator Edmund Muskie reflects the view of some environmentalists. Clean air and clean water,
               they argue, are fundamental human rights that should not be debased by considering them in
               economic terms. How can you put a price on clean air and clean water? The environment is so
               important, they claim, that we should protect it as much as possible, regardless of the cost.

                       Economists  have  little  sympathy  for  this  type  of  argument.  To  economists,  good
               environmental policy begins by acknowledging the first of the Ten Principles of

                       Economics  in  Chapter  1:  People  face  trade-offs.  Certainly,  clean  air  and  clean  water
               have value. But their value must be compared to their opportunity cost—that is, to what one
               must  give  up  to  obtain  them.  Eliminating  all  pollution  is  impossible.  Trying  to  eliminate  all
               pollution  would  reverse  many  of  the  technological  advances  that  allow  us  to  enjoy  a  high
               standard  of  living.  Few  people  would  be  willing  to  accept  poor  nutrition,  inadequate  medical
               care, or shoddy housing to make the environment as clean as possible.

                       Economists argue that some environmental activists hurt their own cause by not thinking
               in economic terms. A clean environment is a good like other goods. Like all normal goods, it has
               a positive income elasticity: Rich countries can  afford  a cleaner  environment than poor  ones
               and, therefore, usually have more rigorous environmental protection. In addition, like most other
               goods, clean air and clean water obey the law of demand: The lower the price of environmental
               protection, the more the public will want. The economic approach of using pollution permits and

                                                            107]]></page><page Index="377"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY             Department of Management

               corrective taxes reduces the cost of environmental protection and should, therefore, increase
               the public’s demand for a clean environment.


               PRIVATE SOLUTIONS TO EXTERNALITIES

                       Although externalities tend to cause markets to be inefficient, government action is not
               always  needed  to  solve  the  problem.  In  some  circumstances,  people  can  develop  private
               solutions.


               THE TYPES OF PRIVATE SOLUTIONS

                       Sometimes the problem of externalities is solved with moral codes and social sanctions.
               Consider, for instance, why most people do not litter. Although there are laws against littering,
               these laws are not vigorously enforced. Most people do not litter just because it is the wrong
               thing to do. The Golden Rule taught to most children says, “Do unto others as you would have
               them do unto you.” This moral injunction tells us to take account of how our actions affect other
               people. In economic terms, it tells us to internalize externalities.


                       Another private  solution to  externalities is charities, many  of which are  established to
               deal with externalities. For example, the Sierra Club, whose goal is to protect the environment,
               is  a  nonprofit  organization  funded  with  private  donations.  As  another  example,  colleges  and
               universities receive gifts from alumni, corporations,  and foundations in part because education
               has  positive  externalities  for  society.  The  government  encourages  this  private  solution  to
               externalities  through  the  tax  system  by  allowing  an  income  tax  deduction  for  charitable
               donations. The private market can often solve the problem of externalities by relying on the self-
               interest of the relevant parties. Sometimes the solution takes the form of integrating different
               types of businesses. For example, consider an apple grower and a beekeeper who are located
               next to each other. Each business confers a positive externality on the other: By pollinating the
               flowers on the trees, the bees help the orchard produce apples. At the same time, the bees use
               the nectar they get from the apple trees to produce honey. Nonetheless, when the apple grower
               is deciding how many trees to plant and the beekeeper is deciding how many bees to keep, they
               neglect  the  positive  externality.  As  a  result,  the  apple  grower  plants  too  few  trees  and  the
               beekeeper  keeps  too  few  bees.  These  externalities  could  be  internalized  if  the  beekeeper
               bought the apple orchard or if the apple grower bought the beehives: Both activities would then
               take place within the same firm, and this single firm could choose the optimal number of trees
               and bees. Internalizing externalities is one reason that some firms are involved in different types
               of businesses.


                       Another  way  for  the  private  market  to  deal  with  external  effects  is  for  the  interested
               parties to enter into a contract. In the foregoing example, a contract between the apple grower
               and the beekeeper can solve the problem of too few trees and too few bees. The contract can
               specify the number of trees, the number of bees, and perhaps a payment from one party to the



                                                            108]]></page><page Index="378"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY             Department of Management
                        Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus  BMGT21: Basic Microeconomics


               other. By setting the right number of trees and bees, the contract can solve the inefficiency that
               normally arises from these externalities and make both parties better off.

               THE COASE THEOREM

                       How effective is the private market in dealing with externalities? A famous result, called
               the Coase  theorem after  economist Ronald Coase, suggests that it can be  very  effective in
               some circumstances. According to the Coase theorem, if private parties can bargain over the
               allocation  of  resources  at  no  cost,  then  the  private  market  will  always  solve  the  problem  of
               externalities and allocate resources efficiently.


                       To see how the Coase theorem works, consider an example. Suppose that Dick owns a
               dog  named  Spot.  Spot  barks  and  disturbs  Jane,  Dick’s  neighbor.  Dick  gets  a  benefit  from
               owning the dog, but the dog confers a negative externality on Jane Should Dick be forced to
               send  Spot  to  the  pound,  or  should  Jane  have  to  suffer  sleepless  nights  because  of  Spot’s
               barking? Consider first what outcome is socially efficient. A social planner, considering the two
               alternatives, would compare the benefit that Dick gets from the dog to the cost that Jane bears
               from the barking. If the benefit exceeds the cost, it is efficient for Dick to keep the dog and
               for Jane to live with the barking. Yet if the cost exceeds the benefit, then Dick should get rid of
               the dog.

                       According to the Coase theorem, the private market will reach the efficient outcome on
               its own. How? Jane can simply offer to pay Dick to get rid of the dog. Dick will accept the deal if
               the amount of money Jane offers is greater than the benefit of keeping the dog. By bargaining
               over the price, Dick and Jane can always reach the efficient outcome. For instance, suppose
               that Dick gets a $500 benefit from the dog and Jane bears an $800 cost from the barking. In this
               case, Jane can offer Dick $600 to get rid of the dog, and Dick will gladly accept.
                       Both parties are better off than they were before, and the efficient outcome is reached. It
               is possible, of course, that Jane would not be willing to offer any price that Dick would accept.
               For instance, suppose that Dick gets a $1,000 benefit from the dog and Jane bears an $800
               cost from the barking. In this case, Dick would turn down any offer below $1,000, while Jane
               would not offer any amount above $800. Therefore, Dick ends up keeping the dog. Given these
               costs and benefits, however, this outcome is efficient. So far, we have assumed that Dick has
               the legal right to keep a barking dog. In other words, we have assumed that Dick can keep Spot
               unless Jane pays him enough to induce him to give up the dog voluntarily. But how different
               would the outcome be if Jane had the legal right to peace and quiet?

                       According to the Coase theorem, the initial distribution of rights does not matter
               for the market’s ability to reach the efficient outcome. For instance, suppose that Jane can
               legally compel Dick to get rid of the dog. Although having this right works to Jane’s advantage, it
               probably will not change the outcome. In this case, Dick can offer to pay Jane to allow him to



                                                            109]]></page><page Index="379"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY             Department of Management
                        Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus  BMGT21: Basic Microeconomics


               keep the dog. If the benefit of the dog to Dick exceeds the cost of the barking to Jane, then Dick
               and Jane will strike a bargain in which Dick keeps the dog.

               Although Dick and Jane can reach the efficient outcome regardless  of how rights are initially
               distributed, the distribution of rights is not irrelevant: It determines the distribution of economic
               well-being. Whether Dick has the right to a barking dog  or Jane the right to peace  and quiet
               determines who pays whom in the final bargain. But in either case, the two parties can bargain
               with each other and solve the externality problem. Dick will end up keeping the dog only if the
               benefit exceeds the cost.

               To sum up: The Coase theorem says that private economic actors can solve the problem
               of  externalities  among  themselves.  Whatever  the  initial  distribution  of  rights,  the
               interested  parties  can  always  reach  a  bargain  in  which  everyone is  better  off  and  the
               outcome is efficient.

               WHY PRIVATE SOLUTIONS DO NOT ALWAYS WORK

                       Despite the appealing logic of the Coase theorem, private individuals on their own often
               fail to resolve the problems caused by externalities. The Coase theorem applies only when the
               interested  parties  have  no  trouble  reaching  and  enforcing  an  agreement.  In  the  real  world,
               however,  bargaining  does  not  always  work,  even  when  a  mutually  beneficial  agreement  is
               possible.

                       Sometimes  the  interested  parties  fail  to  solve  an  externality  problem  because  of
               transaction  costs,  the  costs  that  parties  incur  in  the  process  of  agreeing  to  and  following
               through on a bargain. In our example, imagine that Dick and Jane speak different languages so
               that, to reach an agreement, they need to hire a translator.

                       If the benefit of solving the barking problem is less than the cost of the translator, Dick
               and  Jane  might  choose  to  leave  the  problem  unsolved.  In  more  realistic  examples,  the
               transaction  costs  are  the  expenses  not  of  translators  but  of  the  layers  required  to  draft  and
               enforce contracts.

                       At other times, bargaining simply breaks down. The recurrence of wars and labor strikes
               shows  that  reaching  agreement  can  be  difficult  and  that  failing  to  reach  agreement  can  be
               costly. The problem is often that  each party tries to hold  out for  a better deal. For  example,
               suppose that Dick gets  a $500 benefit from the dog, and Jane bears  an $800 cost from the
               barking. Although it is efficient for Jane to pay Dick to get rid of the dog, there are many prices
               that could lead to this outcome. Dick might demand $750, and Jane might offer only $550. As
               they haggle over the price, the inefficient outcome with the barking dog persists.

                       Reaching an efficient bargain is especially difficult when the number of interested parties
               is large because coordinating everyone is costly. For example, consider a factory that pollutes
               the water of a nearby lake. The pollution confers a negative externality on the local fishermen.

                       According to the Coase theorem, if the pollution is inefficient, then the factory and the
               fishermen could reach a bargain in which the fishermen pay the factory not to pollute. If there


                                                            110]]></page><page Index="380"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY             Department of Management

               are many fishermen, however, trying to coordinate them all to bargain with the factory may be
               almost impossible.

                       When private bargaining does not work, the government can sometimes play a role. The
               government is an institution designed for collective action. In this example, the government can
               act  on  behalf  of  the  fishermen,  even  when  it  is  impractical  for  the  fishermen  to  act  for
               themselves.

               CONCLUSION

               The invisible hand is powerful but not omnipotent.

               A  market’s  equilibrium  maximizes  the  sum  of  producer  and  consumer  surplus.  When  the
               buyers and sellers in the market are the only interested parties, this outcome is efficient from the
               standpoint  of  society  as  a  whole.  But  when  there  are  external  effects,  such  as  pollution,
               evaluating a market outcome requires taking into account the well-being of third parties
               as  well.  In  this  case,  the  invisible  hand  of  the  marketplace  may  fail  to  allocate  resources
               efficiently.

               In  some  cases,  people  can  solve  the  problem  of  externalities  on  their  own.  The  Coase
               theorem suggests that the interested parties can bargain among themselves and agree
               on  an  efficient  solution.  Sometimes,  however,  an  efficient  outcome  cannot  be  reached,
               perhaps because the large number of interested parties makes bargaining difficult.

               Transaction  costs  the  costs  that  parties  incur  in  the  process  of  agreeing  to  and  following
               through  on  a  bargain  when  people  cannot  solve  the  problem  of  externalities  privately,  the
               government often steps in.

               Yet  even  with  government  intervention,  society  should  not  abandon  market  forces  entirely.
               Rather, the government can address the problem by requiring decision makers to bear
               the  full  costs  of  their  actions.  Corrective  taxes  on  emissions  and  pollution  permits,  for
               instance, are designed to internalize the externality of pollution. More and more, these are the
               policies  of choice  for those interested in protecting the environment.  Market forces, properly
               redirected, are often the best remedy for market failure.

               WEEK 11

               LESSON:  THE ECONOMICS OF THE PUBLIC SECTOR
                                      2.  Public Goods and Common Resources
                                            3.  The Design of the Tax System

               Learning Objectives:

               After the completion of the chapter, you should be able to:
               1.  Compare public goods and common resources
               2.  Explain the design of tax system

               Overview:


               Public Goods and Common


               Resources
                       An old song lyric maintains that “the best things in life  are free.” A moment’s thought
               reveals a long list of goods that the songwriter could have had in mind. Nature provides some of
               them, such as rivers, mountains, beaches, lakes, and oceans. The government provides others,
               such as playgrounds, parks,  and parades. In each case, people do not pay  a fee when they
               choose to enjoy the benefit of the good.

                       Goods without prices provide a special challenge for economic analysis. Most goods in
               our economy are allocated in markets, where buyers pay for what they receive and sellers are
               paid for what they provide. For these goods, prices are the signals that guide the decisions of
               buyers and sellers, and these decisions lead to an efficient allocation of resources. When goods
               are available free of charge, however, the market forces that normally allocate resources in our
               economy are absent.

                       In this lesson, we examine the problems that arise for the allocation of resources when
               there are goods without market prices. Our analysis will shed light on one of the Ten Principles
               of Economics Governments can sometimes improve market outcomes. When a good does
               not have a price attached to it, private markets cannot ensure that the good is produced
               and consumed in the proper amounts. In such cases, government policy can potentially
               remedy the market failure and raise economic well-being.

               Discussion

               THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF GOODS

                       How well do markets work in providing the goods that people want? The answer to this
               question  depends  on  the  good  being  considered.  In  thinking  about  the  various  goods  in  the
               economy, it is useful to group them according to two characteristics:

               • Is the good excludable? That is, can people be prevented from using the good?

                                                            112]]></page><page Index="382"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY             Department of Management
                        Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus  BMGT21: Basic Microeconomics


               • Is the good rival in consumption? That is, does one person’s use of the good reduce another
               person’s ability to use it?



























               Using these two characteristics, Figure 1 divides goods into four categories:

               1. Private goods are both excludable and rival in consumption. Consider an ice-cream cone,
               for example. An ice-cream cone is excludable because it is possible to prevent someone from
               eating  an  ice-cream  cone—you  just  don’t  give  it  to  him.  An  ice-cream  cone  is  rival  in
               consumption  because  if  one  person  eats  an  ice-cream  cone,  another  person  cannot  eat  the
               same cone. Most goods in the economy are private goods like ice-cream cones: You don’t get
               one unless you pay, and once you have it, you are the only person who benefits

               2.  Public  goods  are  neither  excludable  nor  rival  in  consumption.  That  is,  people  cannot  be
               prevented from using a public good, and one person’s use of a public good does not reduce
               another person’s ability to use it. For example, a tornado siren in a small town is a public good.
               Once the siren sounds, it is impossible to prevent any single person from hearing it (so it is not
               excludable). Moreover, when one person gets the benefit of the warning, she does not reduce
               the benefit to anyone else (so it is not rival in consumption).

               3. Common resources are rival in consumption but not excludable. For example, fish in the
               ocean are rival in consumption: When one person catches fish, there are fewer fish for the next
               person to catch. Yet these fish are not an excludable good because, given the vast size of an
               ocean, it is difficult to stop fishermen from taking fish out of it.

               4. When a good is excludable but not rival in consumption, it is an example of a good produced
               by  a  natural  monopoly. For  instance,  consider  fire  protection  in  a  small  town.  It  is  easy  to
               exclude someone from using this good: The fire department can just let his house burn down.
               Yet fire protection is not rival in consumption: Once a town has paid for the fire department, the
               additional cost of protecting one more house is small.

               PUBLIC GOODS

                       To understand how public goods differ from other goods and the problems they present
               for society, let’s consider an example: a fireworks display. This good is not excludable because
               it is impossible to prevent someone from seeing  fireworks,  and it is not  rival in consumption
               because  one  person’s  enjoyment  of  fireworks  does  not  reduce  anyone  else’s  enjoyment  of
               them.

               SOME IMPORTANT PUBLIC GOODS
               There are many examples of public goods. Here we consider three of the most important.

               National Defense The defense of a country from foreign aggressors is a classic example of a
               public good. Once the country is defended, it is impossible to prevent any single person from
               enjoying the benefit of this defense. Moreover, when one person enjoys the benefit of national
               defense,  he  does  not  reduce  the  benefit  to  anyone  else.  Thus,  national  defense  is  neither
               excludable nor rival in consumption.

                       National  defense  is  also  one  of  the  most  expensive  public  goods.  In  2007,  the  U.S.
               federal  government  spent  a  total  of  $553  billion  on  national  defense,  more  than  $1,800  per
               person. People disagree about whether this amount is too small or too large, but almost no one
               doubts  that  some  government  spending  for  national  defense  is  necessary.  Even  economists
               who  advocate  small  government  agree  that  the  national  defense  is  a  public  good  the
               government should provide.

               Basic Research Knowledge is created through research. In evaluating the appropriate public
               policy toward knowledge creation, it is important to distinguish general knowledge from specific
               technological knowledge. Specific technological knowledge, such as the invention of a longer-
               lasting battery, a smaller microchip, or a better digital music player, can be patented.

                       The patent gives the inventor the exclusive right to the knowledge he or she has created
               for  a  period  of  time.  Anyone  else  who  wants  to  use  the  patented  information  must  pay  the
               inventor for the right to do so. In other words, the patent makes the knowledge created by the
               inventor excludable.

                       By contrast, general knowledge is a public good. For example, a mathematician cannot
               patent  a theorem. Once a theorem is proved, the knowledge is not excludable: The theorem
               enters society’s general pool of knowledge that anyone can use without charge. The theorem is
               also  not  rival  in  consumption:  One  person’s  use  of  the  theorem  does  not  prevent  any  other
               person from using the theorem. Profit-seeking firms spend a lot on research trying to develop
               new products that they can patent and sell, but they do not spend much on basic research.

                       Their incentive, instead, is to free ride on the general knowledge created by others. As a
               result, in the absence of any public policy, society would devote too few resources to creating

                                                            114]]></page><page Index="384"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY             Department of Management

               new  knowledge.  The  government  tries  to  provide  the  public  good  of  general  knowledge  in
               various ways.

                        Government  agencies,  such  as  the  National  Institutes  of  Health  and  the  National
               Science  Foundation,  subsidize  basic  research  in medicine, mathematics,  physics,  chemistry,
               biology, and even economics. Some people justify government funding of the space program on
               the grounds that it adds to society’s pool of knowledge (although many scientists are skeptical
               of the scientific value of manned space travel).

                       Determining the appropriate level of government support for these endeavors is difficult
               because  the  benefits  are  hard  to  measure.  Moreover,  the  members  of  Congress  who
               appropriate funds for research usually have little expertise in science and, therefore, are not in
               the  best  position  to  judge  what  lines  of  research  will  produce  the  largest  benefits.  So, while
               basic research is surely a public good, we should not be surprised if the public sector fails to
               pay for the right amount and the right kinds.

               Fighting Poverty
                       Many government programs are aimed at helping the poor. The welfare system (officially
               called  Temporary  Assistance  for  Needy  Families)  provides  a  small  income  for  some  poor
               families. Similarly, the Food Stamp program subsidizes the purchase of food for those with low
               incomes,  and  various  government  housing  programs  make  shelter  more  affordable.  These
               antipoverty programs are financed by taxes paid by families that are financially more successful.

                       Economists disagree among themselves about what role the government should play in
               fighting poverty. Although we discuss this debate more fully in Chapter 20, here we note one
               important argument: Advocates of antipoverty programs claim that fighting poverty is a public
               good. Even if everyone prefers living in a society without poverty, fighting poverty is not a “good”
               that private actions will adequately provide.

                       To see why, suppose someone tried to organize a group of wealthy individuals to try to
               eliminate  poverty.  They  would  be  providing  a  public  good.  This  good  would  not  be  rival  in
               consumption: One person’s enjoyment of living in a society without poverty would not reduce
               anyone else’s enjoyment of it. The good would not be excludable: Once poverty is eliminated,
               no one can be prevented from taking pleasure in this fact.

                       As a result, there would be a tendency for people to free ride on the generosity of others,
               enjoying the benefits of poverty elimination without contributing to the cause. Because  of the
               free-rider  problem,  eliminating  poverty  through  private  charity  will  probably  not  work.  Yet
               government action can solve this problem. Taxing the wealthy to raise the living standards of
               the poor can potentially make everyone better off. The poor are better  off because they now
               enjoy a higher standard of living, and those paying the taxes are better off because they enjoy
               living in a society with less poverty.

               THE DIFFICULT JOB OF COST–BENEFIT ANALYSIS

                       So far we have  seen that the government provides public goods because the private
               market on its own will not produce an efficient quantity. Yet deciding that the government must
               play  a  role  is  only  the  first  step.  The  government must then  determine  what  kinds  of  public
               goods to provide and in what quantities.

                       Suppose that the government is considering  a public project, such as building a new
               highway. To judge whether to build the highway, it must compare the total benefits of all those
               who  would  use  it  to  the  costs  of  building  and  maintaining  it.  To  make  this  decision,  the
               government might hire a team of economists and engineers to conduct a study, called a cost–
               benefit analysis, the goal of which is to estimate the total costs and benefits of the project to
               society as a whole.

               COMMON RESOURCES

                       Common  resources,  like  public  goods,  are  not  excludable:  They  are  available  free  of
               charge  to  anyone  who  wants  to  use  them.  Common  resources  are,  however,  rival  in
               consumption: One person’s use of the common resource reduces other people’s ability to use it.
               Thus, common resources give rise to a new problem. Once the good is provided, policymakers
               need to be concerned  about how much it is used. This problem is best understood from the
               classic parable called the Tragedy of the Commons.

               THE TRAGEDY OF THE COMMONS

                       Consider life in a small medieval town. Of the many economic activities that take place in
               the town, one of the most important is raising sheep. Many of the town’s families own flocks of
               sheep and support themselves by selling the sheep’s wool, which is used to make clothing. As
               our story begins, the sheep spend much of their time grazing on the land surrounding the town,
               called the Town Common.
                       No family owns the land. Instead, the town residents own the land collectively, and all
               the residents are allowed to graze their sheep on it. Collective ownership works well because
               land is plentiful. As long as  everyone can get all the good grazing land they want, the Town
               Common is not rival in consumption, and allowing residents’ sheep to graze for free causes no
               problems. Everyone in town is happy.

                        As the years pass, the population of the town grows, and so does the number of sheep
               grazing on the Town Common. With a growing number of sheep and a fixed amount of land, the
               land starts to lose its ability to replenish itself. Eventually, the land is grazed so heavily that it
               becomes barren. With no grass left on the Town Common, raising sheep is impossible, and the
               town’s once prosperous wool industry disappears.

                        Many  families  lose  their  source  of  livelihood. What causes  the  tragedy? Why  do  the
               shepherds allow the sheep population to grow so large that it destroys the Town Common? The


                                                            116]]></page><page Index="386"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY             Department of Management
                        Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus  BMGT21: Basic Microeconomics


               reason is that social and private incentives differ. Avoiding the destruction of the grazing land
               depends on the collective action of the shepherds. If the shepherds acted together, they could
               reduce the sheep population to a size that the Town Common can support. Yet no single family
               has an incentive to reduce the size of its own flock because each flock represents only a small
               part of the problem.

                       In essence, the Tragedy of the Commons arises because of an externality. When one
               family’s flock grazes on the common land, it reduces the quality of the land available for other
               families. Because people neglect this negative externality when  deciding how many sheep to
               own, the result is an excessive number of sheep. If the tragedy had been foreseen, the town
               could have solved the problem in various ways. It could have regulated the number of sheep in
               each  family’s  flock,  internalized  the  externality  by  taxing  sheep,  or  auctioned  off  a  limited
               number of sheep-grazing permits. That is, the medieval town could have dealt with the problem
               of overgrazing in the way that modern society deals with the problem of pollution.

               In the case of land, however, there is a simpler solution. The town can divide the land among
               town families. Each family can enclose its parcel of land with a fence and then protect it from
               excessive  grazing.  In  this  way,  the  land  becomes  a  private  good  rather  than  a  common
               resource. This outcome in fact occurred during the enclosure movement in England in the 17th
               century.

               The Tragedy of the Commons is a story with a general lesson: When one person uses a
               common resource, he or she diminishes other people’s enjoyment of it. Because of this
               negative externality, common resources tend to be used excessively. The government
               can  solve  the  problem  by  using  regulation  or  taxes  to  reduce  consumption  of  the
               common resource.

               Alternatively, the government can sometimes turn the common resource into a private
               good.  This  lesson  has  been  known  for  thousands  of  years.  The  ancient  Greek
               philosopher  Aristotle  pointed  out  the  problem  with  common  resources:  “What  is
               common to many is taken least care of, for all men have greater regard for what is their
               own than for what they possess in common with others.”

               SOME IMPORTANT COMMON RESOURCES

               There are many examples of common resources. In almost all cases, the same problem arises
               as  in  the  Tragedy  of  the  Commons:  Private  decision  makers  use  the  common  resource  too
               much. Governments often regulate behavior or impose fees to mitigate the problem of overuse.

               Clean Air and Water As we discussed in Chapter 10, markets do not adequately protect the
               environment. Pollution is a negative  externality that can be remedied with regulations  or with
               corrective  taxes  on  polluting  activities.  One  can  view  this market  failure  as  an  example  of  a
               common-resource problem. Clean air and clean water are common resources like open grazing
               land, and excessive pollution is like excessive grazing. Environmental degradation is a modern
               Tragedy of the Commons.

               Congested Roads- Roads can be either public goods or common resources. If a road is not
               congested, then one person’s use does not affect anyone else. In this case, use is not rival in
               consumption, and the road is a public good. Yet if a road is congested, then use of that road
               yields a negative externality. When one person drives on the road, it becomes more crowded,
               and other people must drive more slowly. In this case, the road is a common resource.

               CONCLUSION: THE IMPORTANCE

               OF PROPERTY RIGHTS

                       In this and the previous lesson, we have seen there are some “goods” that the market
               does not provide adequately. Markets do not ensure that the air we breathe is clean or that our
               country  is  defended  from  foreign  aggressors.  Instead,  societies  rely  on  the  government  to
               protect the environment and to provide for the national defense.

               Although the problems we considered in these chapters arise in many different markets, they
               share a common theme. In all cases, the market fails to allocate resources efficiently because
               property rights are not well established. That is, some item of value does not have an owner
               with the legal authority to control it.

               For  example,  although  no  one  doubts  that  the  “good”  of  clean  air  or  national  defense  is
               valuable, no one has the right to attach a price to it and profit from its use. A factory pollutes too
               much because no one charges the factory for the pollution it emits.

                       The market does not provide for national defense because no one can charge those who
               are defended for the benefit they receive. When the absence of property rights causes a market
               failure, the government can potentially solve the problem. Sometimes, as in the sale of pollution
               permits, the solution is for the government to help define property rights and thereby unleash
               market forces. Other times, as in restricted hunting seasons, the solution is for the government
               to regulate private behavior.

                       Still  other  times,  as  in  the  provision  of  national  defense,  the  solution  is  for  the
               government to use tax revenue to supply a good that the market fails to supply. In all cases, if
               the  policy  is  well  planned  and well  run,  it  can make  the  allocation  of  resources  more
               efficient and thus raise economic well-being.

               3:  THE DESIGN OF THE TAX SYSTEM


               TAXES AND EFFICIENCY

               The primary aim of a tax system is to raise revenue for the government, but there  are many
               ways to raise any given amount of money. When choosing among 249the many alternative tax
               systems, policymakers have two objectives: efficiency and equity. One tax system is more
               efficient than another if it raises the same amount of revenue  at a smaller cost to taxpayers.
               What are the costs of taxes to taxpayers? The most obvious cost is the tax payment itself. This
               transfer  of  money  from  the  taxpayer  to  the  government  is  an  inevitable  feature  of  any  tax
               system. Yet taxes also impose two other costs, which a well-designed tax policy tries to avoid
               or, at least, minimize:

               • The deadweight losses that result when taxes distort the decisions that people make
               • The administrative burdens that taxpayers bear as they comply with the tax laws  an efficient
               tax system is one that imposes small deadweight losses and small administrative burdens.

               DEADWEIGHT LOSSES
                       One of the Ten Principles of Economics is that people respond to incentives, and this
               includes incentives provided by the tax system. If the government taxes ice cream, people eat
               less ice cream and more frozen yogurt. If the government taxes housing, people live in smaller
               houses and spend more of their income on other things. If the government taxes labor earnings,
               people work less and enjoy more leisure.

                       Because taxes distort incentives, they entail deadweight losses. As we first discussed in
               Chapter  8,  the  deadweight  loss  of  a  tax  is  the  reduction  in  economic  well-being  of
               taxpayers in excess of the amount of revenue raised by the government. The deadweight
               loss  is  the  inefficiency  that  a  tax  creates  as  people  allocate  resources  according  to  the  tax
               incentive rather than the true costs and benefits of the goods and services that they buy and
               sell.

                       To recall how taxes cause deadweight losses, consider an example. Suppose that Joe
               places an $8 value on a pizza, and Jane places a $6 value on it. If there is no tax on pizza, the
               price of pizza will reflect the cost of making it. Let’s suppose that the price of pizza is $5, so both
               Joe and Jane choose to buy one. Both consumers get some surplus of value over the amount
               paid. Joe gets consumer surplus of $3, and Jane gets consumer surplus of $1. Total surplus is
               $4. Now suppose that the government levies a $2 tax on pizza and the price of pizza rises to $7.
               Joe still buys a pizza, but now he has consumer surplus of only $1. Jane now decides not to buy
               a pizza because its price is higher than its value to her. The government collects tax revenue of
               $2 on Joe’s pizza. Total consumer surplus has fallen by $3 (from $4 to $1).


                       Because  total  surplus  has  fallen  by  more  than  the  tax  revenue,  the  tax  has  a
               deadweight  loss.  In  this  case,  the  deadweight  loss  is  $1.  Notice  that  the  deadweight  loss
               comes not from Joe, the person who pays the tax, but from Jane, the person who doesn’t. The
               reduction of $2 in Joe’s surplus exactly offsets the amount of revenue the government collects.
               The deadweight loss arises because the tax causes Jane to alter her behavior. When the tax
               raises  the  price  of  pizza,  Jane  is  worse  off,  and  yet  there  is  no  offsetting  revenue  to  the
               government. This reduction in Jane’s welfare is the deadweight loss of the tax.

               SHOULD INCOME OR CONSUMPTION BE TAXED?

                       When taxes induce people to change their behavior—such as inducing Jane to buy less
               pizza—the taxes cause deadweight losses and make the allocation of resources less efficient.
               As we have already seen, much government revenue comes from the individual income tax. In
               a case study in Chapter 8, we discussed how this tax discourages people from working as hard
               as they otherwise might.

                       Another  inefficiency  caused  by  this  tax  is  that  it  discourages  people  from  saving.
               Consider  a  person  25  years  old  who  is  considering  saving  $100. If  he  puts  this money  in  a
               savings account that earns 8 percent and leaves it there, he would have $2,172 when he retires

                                                            119]]></page><page Index="389"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY             Department of Management

               at age 65. Yet if the government taxes one-fourth of his interest income each year, the effective
               interest  rate  is  only  6  percent.  After  40  years  of  earning  6  percent,  the  $100  grows  to  only
               $1,029,  less  than  half  of  what  it  would  have  been  without  taxation.  Thus,  because  interest
               income is taxed, saving is much less attractive.

                       Some  economists  advocate  eliminating  the  current  tax  system’s  disincentive  toward
               saving by changing the basis of taxation. Rather than taxing the amount of income that people
               earn, the government could tax the amount that people spend. Under this proposal, all income
               that is saved would not be taxed until the saving is later spent. This alternative system, called a
               consumption tax, would not distort people’s saving decisions.

                       Various  provisions  of  the  current  tax  code  already  make  the  tax  system  a  bit  like  a
               consumption tax. Taxpayers can put a limited amount of their saving into special  accounts—
               such as Individual Retirement Accounts and 401(k) plans—that escape taxation until the money
               is withdrawn at retirement. For people who do most of their saving through these retirement
               accounts,  their  tax  bill  is,  in  effect,  based  on  their  consumption  rather  than  their  income.
               European countries tend to rely more on consumption taxes than does the United States.

                       Most of them raise a significant amount of government revenue through a value-added
               tax, or a VAT. A VAT is like the retail sales tax that many U.S. states use, but rather than
               collecting all  of the tax at the retail  level when the consumer buys the final good, the
               government collects the tax in stages as the good is being produced (that is, as value is
               added by firms along the chain of production).

                       Various U.S. policymakers have proposed that the tax code move further in the direction
               of taxing consumption rather than income. In 2005, economist Alan Greenspan, then Chairman
               of the Federal Reserve, offered this advice to a presidential commission on tax reform: “As you
               know, many economists believe that a consumption tax would be best from the perspective of
               promoting  economic  growth—particularly  if  one  were  designing  a  tax  system  from  scratch—
               because  a  consumption  tax  is  likely  to  encourage  saving  and  capital  formation.  However,
               getting from the current tax system to a consumption tax raises a challenging set of transition
               issues.”

               ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN

                       If you ask the typical person on April 15 for an opinion about the tax system, you might
               get an earful (perhaps peppered with expletives) about the headache of 251filling out tax forms.
               The administrative burden of any tax system is part of the inefficiency it creates. This burden
               includes not only the time spent in early April filling out forms but also the time spent throughout
               the  year  keeping  records  for  tax  purposes  and  the  resources  the  government  has  to  use  to
               enforce the tax laws.

                       Many  taxpayers—especially  those  in  higher  tax  brackets—hire  tax  lawyers  and
               accountants to help them with their taxes. These experts in the complex tax laws fill out the tax
               forms for their clients and help them arrange their affairs in a way that reduces the amount of
               taxes owed. This behavior is legal tax avoidance, which is different from illegal tax evasion.



                                                            120]]></page><page Index="390"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY             Department of Management

                       Critics of our tax system say that these advisers help their clients avoid taxes by abusing
               some  of  the  detailed  provisions  of  the  tax  code,  often  dubbed  “loopholes.”  In  some  cases,
               loopholes are congressional mistakes: They arise from ambiguities or omissions in the tax laws.
               More often, they arise because Congress has chosen to give special treatment to specific types
               of behavior.

                       For  example,  the  U.S.  federal  tax  code  gives  preferential  treatment  to  investors  in
               municipal bonds because Congress wanted to make it easier for state and local governments to
               borrow money. To some extent, this provision benefits states and localities, and to some extent,
               it benefits high-income taxpayers.  Most loopholes  are well known by those in Congress who
               make tax policy, but what looks like a loophole to one taxpayer may look like a justifiable tax
               deduction to another.

                       The resources devoted to complying with the tax laws are a type of deadweight
               loss. The government gets only the amount of taxes paid. By contrast, the taxpayer loses not
               only  this  amount  but  also  the  time  and  money  spent  documenting,  computing,  and
               avoiding taxes. The administrative burden of the tax system could be reduced by simplifying
               the tax laws. Yet simplification is often politically difficult.

                       Most people are ready to simplify the tax code by eliminating the loopholes that benefit
               others, but few are eager to give up the loopholes that benefit them. In the end, the complexity
               of  the  tax  law  results  from  the  political  process  as  various  taxpayers  with  their  own  special
               interests lobby for their causes.

               MARGINAL TAX RATES VERSUS AVERAGE TAX RATES

               When discussing the efficiency and equity of income taxes, economists distinguish between two
               notions of the tax rate: the average and the marginal. The average tax rate is total taxes paid
               divided by total income. The marginal tax rate is the extra taxes paid on an additional dollar of
               income.


                       For  example,  suppose  that  the  government  taxes  20  percent  of  the  first  $50,000  of
               income  and  50  percent  of  all  income  above  $50,000.  Under  this  tax,  a  person  who  makes
               $60,000 pays a tax of $15,000: 20 percent of the first $50,000 (0.20 × $50,000 = $10,000) plus
               50 percent of the next $10,000 (0.50 × $10,000 = $5,000). For this person, the average tax rate
               is $15,000 / $60,000, or 25 percent.

                       But the marginal tax rate is 50 percent. If the taxpayer  earned  an  additional dollar  of
               income, that dollar would be subject to the 50 percent tax  rate, so the  amount the taxpayer
               would owe to the government would rise by $0.50. The marginal and average tax rates each
               contain a useful piece of information. If we are trying to gauge the sacrifice made by a taxpayer,
               the average tax  rate is more  appropriate because it measures the  fraction  of income paid in
               taxes. By contrast, if we are trying to gauge how much the tax system distorts incentives, the
               marginal tax rate is more meaningful.

                       One  of the Ten Principles of Economics is that rational people think  at the margin. A
               corollary  to  this  principle  is  that  the  marginal  tax  rate  measures  how  much  the  tax  system
               discourages people from working. If you are thinking of working an extra few hours, the marginal
               tax  rate  determines  how  much  the  government  takes  of  your  additional  earnings.  It  is  the
               marginal tax rate, therefore, that determines the deadweight loss of an income tax.

               from government services
               Average tax rate total taxes paid divided by total income

               Marginal tax rate the extra taxes paid on an additional dollar of income

               Lump-sum tax a tax that is the same amount for every person

               LUMP-SUM TAXES
                       Suppose the government imposes a tax of $4,000 on everyone. That is, everyone owes
               the same amount, regardless of earnings or any actions that a person might take. Such a tax is
               called  a  lump-sum  tax. A  lump-sum  tax  shows  clearly  the  difference  between  average  and
               marginal tax rates. For  a taxpayer with income of $20,000, the average  tax rate  of  a $4,000
               lump-sum tax is 20 percent; for a taxpayer with income of $40,000, the average tax rate is 10
               percent.  For  both  taxpayers,  the  marginal  tax  rate  is  zero  because  no  tax  is  owed  on  an
               additional dollar of income.

                       A lump-sum tax is the most efficient tax possible. Because a person’s decisions do
               not alter the amount owed, the tax does not distort incentives and, therefore, does not cause
               deadweight losses. Because everyone can easily compute the amount owed and because there
               is  no  benefit  to  hiring  tax  lawyers  and  accountants,  the  lump-sum  tax  imposes  a  minimal
               administrative  burden  on  taxpayers.  If  lump-sum  taxes  are  so  efficient,  why  do  we  rarely
               observe them in the real world? The reason is that efficiency is only one goal of the tax system.

                       A lumpsum tax would take the same amount from the poor  and the rich, an outcome
               most people would view as unfair. To understand the  tax systems that we observe, we must
               therefore consider the other major goal of tax policy: equity.

               TAXES AND EQUITY

               Ever since American colonists dumped imported tea into Boston harbor to protest high British
               taxes, tax policy has generated some of the most heated debates in American politics. The heat
               is rarely fueled by questions of efficiency. Instead, it arises from disagreements over how the tax
               burden should be distributed. Senator Russell Long once mimicked the public debate with this
               ditty:

               Don’t tax you.

               Don’t tax me.



                                                            122]]></page><page Index="392"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY             Department of Management

               Tax that fella behind the tree. Of course, if we are to rely on the government to provide some of
               the goods and services we want, taxes must fall on someone. In this section, we consider the
               equity of a tax system. How should the burden of taxes be divided among the population? How
               do we evaluate whether a tax system is fair? Everyone agrees

               THE BENEFITS PRINCIPLE

                       One principle of taxation, called the benefits principle, states that people should pay
               taxes based on the benefits they receive from government services. This principle tries to make
               public goods similar to private goods. It seems fair that a person who often goes to the movies
               pays more in total for movie tickets than a person who rarely goes. Similarly, a person who gets
               great benefit from a public good should pay more for it than a person who gets little benefit.

                       The  gasoline  tax,  for  instance,  is  sometimes  justified  using  the  benefits  principle.  In
               some states, revenues  from the gasoline tax  are used to build  and maintain roads. Because
               those who buy gasoline  are the same people who use the roads, the gasoline tax might be
               viewed as a fair way to pay for this government service.

                       The benefits principle can also be used to argue that wealthy citizens should pay
               higher  taxes  than  poorer  ones.  Why?  Simply  because  the  wealthy  benefit  more  from
               public  services.  Consider,  for  example,  the  benefits  of  police  protection  from  theft.  Citizens
               with much  to  protect  benefit more  from  police  than  do  those  with  less  to  protect.  Therefore,
               according to the benefits principle, the wealthy should contribute more than the poor to the cost
               of maintaining the police force.

                       The same argument can be used for many other public services, such as fire protection,
               national defense, and the court system. It is even possible to use the benefits principle to argue
               for antipoverty programs funded by taxes on the wealthy.

                       As we discussed in  Chapter 11,  people prefer living in a society without poverty,
               suggesting that antipoverty programs are a public good. If the wealthy place a greater
               dollar  value  on  this  public  good  than  members  of  the  middle  class  do,  perhaps  just
               because the wealthy have more to spend, then according to the benefits principle, they
               should be taxed more heavily to pay for these programs.

               Ability-to-pay principle the idea that taxes should be levied on a person according to how
               well that person can shoulder the burden

               Vertical equity the idea that taxpayers with a greater ability to pay taxes should pay larger
               amounts

               Horizontal equity the idea that taxpayers with similar abilities to pay taxes should pay the
               same amount

               THE ABILITY-TO-PAY PRINCIPLE

                       Another way to evaluate the equity of a tax system is called the ability-to-pay principle,
               which states that taxes should be levied  on  a person  according to how well that person can
               shoulder the burden. This principle is sometimes justified by the claim that all citizens should
               make  an “equal sacrifice” to support the government. The magnitude of  a person’s sacrifice,
               however, depends not only  on the size of his tax payment but also  on his income and  other
               circumstances.  A  $1,000  tax  paid  by  a  poor  person  may  require  a  larger  sacrifice  than  a
               $10,000 tax paid by a rich one.

               The ability-to-pay principle leads to two corollary notions of equity: vertical equity and horizontal
               equity. Vertical equity states that taxpayers with a greater ability to pay taxes should contribute
               a  larger  amount.  Horizontal  equity  states  that  taxpayers  with  similar  abilities  to  pay  should
               contribute the same amount. These notions of equity are widely accepted, but applying them to
               evaluate a tax system is rarely straightforward.

               Vertical Equity If taxes are based on ability to pay, then richer taxpayers should pay more
               than poorer taxpayers. But how much more should the rich pay? Much of the debate over tax
               policy  concerns  this  question.  Consider  the  three  tax  systems  in  Table  7.  In  each  case,
               taxpayers with higher incomes pay more. Yet the systems differ in how quickly taxes rise with
               income.

               The first system is called proportional because all taxpayers pay the same fraction of income.
               The second system is called regressive because high-income taxpayers pay a smaller fraction
               of their income, even though they pay a larger amount. The third system is called progressive
               because high-income taxpayers pay a larger fraction of their income. Which of these three tax
               systems is most fair? There is no obvious answer, and economic theory does not offer any help
               in trying to find one. Equity, like beauty, is in the eye of the beholder.

               Proportional tax a tax for which highincome and low-income taxpayers pay the same fraction
               of income
               Regressive tax a tax for which highincome taxpayers pay  a smaller fraction of their  income
               than do low income taxpayers
               Progressive tax  a tax  for which high  income taxpayers pay  a larger fraction of their  income
               than do low income taxpayers

               HOW THE TAX BURDEN IS DISTRIBUTED

               Much  debate  over  tax  policy  concerns  whether  the  wealthy  pay  their  fair  share.  There  is  no
               objective way to make this judgment. In evaluating the issue for yourself, however, it is useful to
               know how much families with different incomes pay under the current tax system.

               Table 8 presents some data on how all federal taxes are distributed among income classes. To
               construct this table, families are ranked according to their income and placed into five groups of
               equal size, called quintiles. The table also presents data on the richest 1 percent of Americans.

               The second column of the table shows the average income of each group. The poorest one-fifth
               of  families  had  average  income  of  $15,900,  and  the  richest  onefifth  had  average  income  of
               $231,300. The richest 1 percent had average income of over $1 million.
               The next column of the table shows total taxes as a percentage of income. As you can see, the
               U.S. federal tax system is progressive. The poorest fifth  of  families  paid 4.3 percent  of their
               incomes in taxes, and the richest fifth paid 25.5 percent.

               The top 1 percent paid 31.2 percent of their incomes. The fourth and fifth columns compare the
               distribution of income and the distribution of taxes. The poorest quintile earns 4.0 percent of all
               income and pays 0.8 percent of all taxes. The richest quintile earns 55.1 percent of all income
               and pays 68.7 percent of all taxes. The richest 1 percent (which, remember, is 1⁄20 the size of
               each quintile) earns 18.1 percent of all income and pays 27.6 percent of all taxes.

               This table on taxes is a good starting point for understanding the burden of government, but the
               picture it offers is incomplete. Although it includes all the taxes that flow from households to the
               federal  government,  it  fails  to  include  the  transfer  payments,  such  as  Social  Security  and
               welfare, that flow from the federal government back to households.

               Studies that include both taxes and transfers show even greater progressivity. The richest group
               of families still pays about one-quarter of its income to the government, even after transfers are
               subtracted. By contrast, poor families typically receive more in transfers than they pay in taxes.
               The average tax rate  of the poorest quintile, rather than being 4.3 percent as in the table, is
               approximately negative 30 percent. In other words, their income is about 30 percent higher than
               it would be without government taxes and transfers. The lesson is clear: To understand fully the
               progressivity of government policies, one must take account of both what people pay and what
               they receive.

               Horizontal Equity
                        If taxes are based on ability to pay, then similar taxpayers should pay similar amounts of
               taxes.  But  what  determines  if  two  taxpayers  are  similar?  Families  differ  in  many  ways.  To
               evaluate whether a tax code is horizontally equitable, one must determine which differences are
               relevant for a family’s ability to pay and which differences are not.

                       Suppose the Smith and Jones families each have income of $80,000. The Smiths have
               no  children,  but  Mr.  Smith  has  an  illness  that  causes  medical  expenses  of  $30,000.  The
               Joneses  are  in  good  health,  but  they  have  four  children.  Two  of  the  Jones  children  are  in
               college, generating tuition bills of $40,000. Would it be fair for these two  families to pay the
               same tax because they have the same income? Would it be fair to give the Smiths a tax break
               to help them offset their high medical expenses? Would it be fair to give the Joneses a tax break
               to help them with their tuition expenses?

                       There are no easy answers to these questions. In practice, the U.S. income tax is filled
               with special provisions that alter a family’s tax based on its specific circumstances.

               TAX INCIDENCE AND TAX EQUITY

               Tax incidence—the study of who bears the burden of taxes—is central to evaluating tax
               equity. As we first saw in Chapter 6, the person who bears the burden of a tax is not always the
               person who gets the tax bill from the government. Because taxes alter supply and demand, they
               alter equilibrium prices. As a result, they affect people beyond those who, according to statute,
               actually pay the tax. When evaluating the vertical and horizontal equity of any tax, it is important
               to take these indirect effects into account. Many discussions of tax equity ignore the indirect
               effects of taxes and are based on what economists mockingly call the flypaper theory of tax
               incidence. According to this theory, the burden of a tax, like a fly on flypaper, sticks wherever it
               first lands. This assumption, however, is rarely valid.

                       For example, a person not trained in economics might argue that a tax on expensive fur
               coats is vertically equitable because most buyers of furs are wealthy. Yet if these buyers can
               easily substitute other luxuries for furs, then a tax on furs might only reduce the sale of furs. In
               the end, the burden of the tax will fall more on those who make and sell furs than on those who



                                                            126]]></page><page Index="396"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY             Department of Management
                        Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus  BMGT21: Basic Microeconomics


               buy them. Because most workers who make furs are not wealthy, the equity of a fur tax could
               be quite different from what the flypaper theory indicates.

               WHO PAYS THE CORPORATE INCOME TAX?
                       The  corporate  income  tax  provides  a  good  example  of  the  importance  of  tax
               incidence for tax policy. The corporate tax is popular among voters. After all, corporations are
               not people. Voters  are  always  eager to have their taxes reduced and have some impersonal
               corporation pick up the tab. But before deciding that the corporate income tax is a good way
               for the government to raise revenue, we should consider who bears the burden of the
               corporate  tax.  This  is  a  difficult  question  on  which  economists  disagree,  but  one  thing  is
               certain:  People  pay  all  taxes.  When  the  government  levies  a  tax  on  a  corporation,  the
               corporation is more like a tax collector than a taxpayer.

                       The  burden  of  the  tax  ultimately  falls  on  people—the  owners,  customers,  or
               workers of the corporation. Many economists believe that workers and customers bear much
               of the burden of the corporate income tax. To see why, consider an example. Suppose that the
               U.S. government decides to raise the tax on the income earned by car companies. At first, this
               tax hurts the owners of the car companies, who receive less profit. But over time, these owners
               will respond to the tax.

               Because producing cars is less profitable, they invest less in building new car factories. Instead,
               they  invest  their  wealth  in  other  ways—for  example,  by  buying  larger  houses  or  by  building
               factories  in  other  industries  or  other  countries.  With  fewer  car  factories,  the  supply  of  cars
               declines, as does the demand for autoworkers. Thus, a tax on corporations making cars causes
               the price of cars to rise and the wages of autoworkers to fall.

               The corporate income tax shows how dangerous the flypaper theory of tax incidence can
               be.  The  corporate  income  tax  is  popular  in  part  because  it  appears  to  be  paid  by  rich
               corporations. Yet those who bear the ultimate burden of the tax—the customers and workers of
               corporations—are  often  not  rich. If  the  true  incidence  of  the  corporate  tax  were  more  widely
               known, this tax might be less popular among voters.

               CONCLUSION: THE TRADE-OFF BETWEEN EQUITY
               AND EFFICIENCY

               Almost everyone agrees that equity and efficiency are the two most important goals
               of the tax system. But often, these two goals conflict, especially when equity is judged by the
               progressivity  of  the  tax  system. People  disagree  about  tax  policy  often  because  they  attach
               different weights to these goals.

                       The recent history of tax policy shows how political leaders differ in their views on equity
               and efficiency. When Ronald Reagan was elected president in 1980, the marginal tax rate on
               the earnings of the richest Americans was 50 percent. On interest income, the marginal tax rate
               was 70 percent. Reagan argued that such high tax rates greatly distorted economic incentives
               to work and save. In other words, he claimed that these high tax rates cost too much in terms of
               economic  efficiency.  Tax  reform was,  therefore,  a  high  priority  of  his  administration.  Reagan


                                                            127]]></page><page Index="397"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY             Department of Management

               signed into law large cuts in tax rates in 1981 and then again in 1986. When Reagan left office
               in 1989, the richest Americans faced a marginal tax rate of only28 percent.

                       The pendulum of political debate swings both ways. When Bill Clinton ran for president
               in 1992, he argued that the rich were not paying their fair share of taxes. In other words, the low
               tax rates on the rich violated his view of vertical equity. In 1993, President Clinton signed into
               law a bill that raised the tax rates on the richest Americans to about 40 percent. When George
               W. Bush ran for president, he reprised many of Reagan’s themes, and as president he reversed
               part of the Clinton tax increase, reducing the highest tax rate to 35 percent. During the 2008
               presidential  campaign,  Republican  John  McCain  advocated  making  the  Bush  tax  cuts
               permanent, while Democrat Barack Obama proposed increasing the top marginal tax rate.

                       Economics alone cannot determine the best way to balance the goals of efficiency
               and  equity.  This  issue  involves  political  philosophy  as  well  as  economics.  But
               economists do have an important role in this debate: They can shed light on the trade-
               offs that society inevitably faces when designing the tax system and can help us avoid
               policies that sacrifice efficiency without any benefit in terms of equity


               SUMMARY

                     The most important taxes for the federal government are individual income taxes
               and payroll taxes for social insurance. The most important taxes for state and local governments
               are sales taxes and property taxes.

                     The efficiency of a tax system refers to the costs it imposes on taxpayers. There are
                       two  costs  of  taxes  beyond  the  transfer  of  resources  from  the  taxpayer  to  the
                       government. The first is the deadweight loss that  arises  as taxes  alter incentives  and
                       distort the allocation of resources. The second is the administrative burden of complying
                       with the tax laws.

                     The equity of a tax system concerns whether the tax burden is distributed fairly among
                       the population. According to the benefits principle, it is fair for people to pay taxes based
                       on the benefits they receive from the government.

                      According to the ability-to-pay principle, it is fair for people to pay taxes based on their
                       capability to handle the financial burden. When evaluating the equity of a tax system, it is
                       important to remember a lesson from the study of tax incidence: The distribution of tax
                       burdens is not the same as the distribution of tax bills.

                     When considering changes in the tax laws, policymakers often face a trade-off between
                       efficiency  and  equity. Much of the debate  over tax policy arises because people give
                       different weights to these two goal

               WEEK 12

               LESSON: FIRM BEHAVIOR - The Cost of Production

               Learning Objectives:

               After the completion of the chapter, you should be able to:

               1.  Identify the cost of production

               2.  Enumerate the cost of production


               Overview:

                       The economy is made up of thousands of firms that produce the goods and services you
               enjoy every day: General Motors produces automobiles, General Electric produces light bulbs,
               and General Mills produces breakfast cereals. Some firms, such as these three, are large; they
               employ  thousands  of  workers  and  have  thousands  of  stockholders  who  share  in  the  firms’
               profits. Other firms, such as the local barbershop or candy store, are small; they employ only a
               few workers and are owned by a single person or family.

                       In previous lessons, we used the supply curve to summarize firms’ production decisions.
               According to the law of supply, firms are willing to produce and sell a greater quantity of a good
               when the price  of the good is higher,  and this response leads to  a supply curve that slopes
               upward. For analyzing many questions, the law of supply is  all you need to know about firm
               behavior.
                       In this lesson and the ones that follow, we examine firm behavior in more detail. This
               topic will give you a better understanding of the decisions behind the supply curve. In addition, it
               will introduce you to a part of economics called industrial organization—the study of how firms’
               decisions about prices and quantities depend on the market conditions they face. The town in
               which you live, for instance, may have several pizzerias but only one cable television company.
               This raises a key question: How does the number of firms affect the prices in a market and the
               efficiency  of  the  market  outcome?  The  field  of  industrial  organization  addresses  exactly  this
               question.

               DISCUSSION:

               I.  WHAT ARE COSTS?

                       We begin our discussion of costs at Caroline’s Cookie Factory. Caroline, the owner of
               the firm, buys flour, sugar, chocolate chips, and  other cookie ingredients. She also buys the
               mixers  and  ovens  and  hires  workers  to  run  this  equipment.  She  then  sells  the  cookies  to


                                                            129]]></page><page Index="399"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY             Department of Management
                        Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus  BMGT21: Basic Microeconomics


               consumers. By examining some of the issues that Caroline faces in her business, we can learn
               some lessons about costs that apply to all firms in an economy.

               A. TOTAL REVENUE, TOTAL COST, AND PROFIT

               Economists normally assume that the goal of a firm is to maximize profit, and they find that this
               assumption works well in most cases. What is a firm’s profit? The amount that the firm receives
               for the sale of its output is called its total revenue. The amount that the firm pays to buy inputs
               (flour, sugar, workers, ovens, and so forth) is called its total cost. Profit is a firm’s total revenue
               minus its total cost:

                                           Profit = Total revenue – Total cost.

               To see how a firm goes about maximizing profit, we must consider fully how to measure its total
               revenue and its total cost. Total revenue is the easy part: It equals the quantity of output the firm
               produces times the price at which it sells its output.

               For example:

               Caroline produces 10,000 cookies and sells them at $2 a cookie, her total revenue is $20,000.
               By contrast, the measurement of a firm’s total cost is more subtle.

               B. COSTS AS OPPORTUNITY COSTS

                       When measuring costs at Caroline’s Cookie Factory or any other firm, it is important to
               keep in mind one of the Ten Principles of Economics from Chapter 1: The cost of something
               is what you give up to get it. Recall that the opportunity cost of an item refers to all those
               things that must be forgone to acquire that item. When economists speak of a firm’s cost of
               production,  they  include  all  the  opportunity  costs  of  making  its  output  of  goods  and
               services.


               When Caroline pays $1,000 for flour, that $1,000 is an opportunity cost because Caroline can
               no  longer  use  that  $1,000  to  buy  something  else.  Similarly,  when  Caroline  hires  workers  to
               make the cookies, the wages she pays are part of the firm’s costs. Because these opportunity
               costs require the firm to pay out some money, they are called explicit costs. By contrast,
               some  of  a  firm’s  opportunity  costs,  called  implicit  costs,  do  not  require  a  cash  outlay.
               Imagine  that  Caroline  is  skilled  with  computers  and  could  earn  $100  per  hour  working  as  a
               programmer. For  every hour that Caroline works  at her cookie factory, she gives up $100 in
               income, and this forgone income is also part of her costs. The total cost of Caroline’s business
               is the sum of the explicit costs and the implicit costs.

               The distinction between  explicit and implicit costs highlights an important difference between
               how economists and accountants analyze a business.

               Economists  are  interested  in  studying  how  firms  make  production  and  pricing  decisions.
               Because these decisions are based on both explicit and implicit costs, economists include both
               when measuring a firm’s costs.

               By contrast, accountants have the job of keeping track of the money that flows into and out of
               firms. As a result, they measure the explicit costs but usually ignore the implicit costs.

                       The  difference  between  economists  and  accountants  is  easy  to  see  in  the  case  of
               Caroline’s  Cookie  Factory.  When  Caroline  gives  up  the  opportunity  to  earn  money  as  a
               computer  programmer,  her  accountant  will  not  count  this  as  a  cost  of  her  cookie  business.
               Because  no  money  flows  out  of  the  business  to  pay  for  this  cost,  it  never  shows  up  on  the
               accountant’s financial statements. An economist, however, will count the forgone income as a
               cost  because  it  will  affect  the  decisions  that  Caroline  makes  in  her  cookie  business.  For
               example, if Caroline’s wage as a computer programmer rises from $100 to $500 per hour, she
               might decide that running her cookie business is too costly and choose to shut down the factory
               to become a full-time computer programmer.



               C.  THE COST OF CAPITAL AS AN OPPORTUNITY COST
               An important implicit cost of almost every business is the opportunity cost of the financial capital
               that has been invested in the business.

               Suppose, for instance, that Caroline used $300,000  of her  savings to buy her cookie factory
               from its previous owner. If Caroline had instead left this money deposited in a savings account
               that pays an interest rate of 5 percent, she would have earned $15,000 per year. To own her
               cookie factory, therefore, Caroline has given up $15,000 a year in interest income. This forgone
               $15,000 is one of the implicit opportunity costs of Caroline’s business.

               As  we  have  already  noted,  economists  and  accountants  treat  costs  differently,  and  this  is
               especially  true  in  their  treatment  of  the  cost  of  capital.  An  economist  views  the  $15,000  in
               interest income that Caroline gives up every year as a cost of her business, even though it is an
               implicit cost. Caroline’s accountant, however, will not show this $15,000 as a cost because no
               money flows out of the business to pay for it.


               To  further  explore  the  difference  between  economists  and  accountants,  let’s  change  the
               example slightly. Suppose now that Caroline did not have the entire $300,000 to buy the factory
               but,  instead,  used  $100,000  of  her  own  savings  and  borrowed  $200,000  from  a  bank  at  an
               interest rate of 5 percent. Caroline’s accountant, who only measures explicit costs, will now
               count the $10,000 interest paid on the bank loan every year as a cost because this amount of
               money now flows out of the firm. By contrast, according to an economist, the opportunity cost of
               owning the business is still $15,000. The opportunity cost equals the interest on the bank loan
               (an explicit cost of $10,000) plus the forgone interest on savings (an implicit cost of $5,000)

               D. ECONOMIC PROFIT VERSUS ACCOUNTING PROFIT
               Now let’s return to the firm’s objective: profit. Because economists and accountants measure
               costs differently, they also measure profit differently. An economist measures a firm’s economic
               profit  as  the  firm’s  total  revenue  minus  all  the  opportunity  costs  (explicit  and  implicit)  of
               producing the goods and services sold.

               An accountant measures the firm’s accounting profit as the firm’s total revenue minus only the
               firm’s explicit costs.

               Figure  1  summarizes  this  difference.  Notice,  that  because  the  accountant  ignores  the
               implicit costs, accounting profit is usually larger than economic profit. For a business to
               be  profitable  from  an  economist’s  standpoint,  total  revenue  must  cover  all  the
               opportunity costs, both explicit and implicit.

               Economic  profit  is  an  important  concept  because  it  is  what  motivates  the  firms  that
               supply goods and services. As we will see, a firm making positive economic profit will stay in
               business. It is covering all its opportunity costs and has some revenue left to reward the firm
               owners. When a firm is making economic losses (that is, when economic profits are negative),
               the business  owners  are failing to  earn  enough revenue to cover  all the costs of production.
               Unless conditions change, the firm owners will eventually close down the business and exit the
               industry.




























               To understand business decisions, we need to keep an eye on economic profit.

               PRODUCTION AND COSTS

               Firms incur costs when they buy inputs to produce the goods and services that they plan
               to sell. In this section, we examine the link between a firm’s production process and its total
               cost. Once again, we consider Caroline’s Cookie Factory.

               In the analysis that follows, we make an important simplifying assumption: We assume that the
               size of Caroline’s factory is fixed and that Caroline can vary the quantity of cookies produced
               only by changing the number of workers she employs. This assumption is realistic in the short
               run but not in the long run. That is, Caroline cannot build a larger factory overnight, but she can
               do so over the next year or two. This analysis, therefore, describes the production decisions that
               Caroline faces in the short run. We examine the relationship between costs and time horizon
               more fully later in the chapter.

               1. THE PRODUCTION FUNCTION

               Table 1 shows how the quantity of cookies produced per hour at Caroline’s factory depends on
               the number of workers. As you can see in the first two columns, if there are no workers in the
               factory, Caroline produces no cookies. When there is 1 worker, she produces 50 cookies. When
               there are 2 workers, she produces 90 cookies and so on.


































               One of the Ten Principles of Economics introduced in Chapter 1 is that rational people think at
               the margin. As we will see in future chapters, this idea is the key to understanding the decisions


                                                            133]]></page><page Index="403"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY             Department of Management
                        Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus  BMGT21: Basic Microeconomics


               a firm makes about how many workers to hire and how much output to produce. To take a step
               toward understanding these decisions, the third column in the table gives the marginal product
               of a worker.

               The marginal product of any input in the production process is the increase in the quantity of
               output obtained from one additional unit of that input. When the number of workers goes from 1
               to 2, cookie production increases from 50 to 90, so the marginal product of the second worker is
               40 cookies. And when the number of workers goes from 2 to 3, cookie  production increases
               from  90  to  120,  so  the  marginal  product  of  the  third  worker  is  30  cookies.  In  the  table,  the
               marginal  product  is  shown  halfway  between  two  rows  because  it  represents  the  change  in
               output as the number of workers increases from one level to another.

               2.  FROM THE PRODUCTION FUNCTION
               TO THE TOTAL-COST CURVE

               The last three columns of Table 1 show Caroline’s cost of producing cookies. In this example,
               the cost of Caroline’s factory is $30 per hour, and the cost of a worker is $10 per hour. If she
               hires 1 worker, her total cost is $40 per hour. If she hires 2 workers, her total cost is $50 per
               hour, and so on. With this information, the table now shows how the number of workers Caroline
               hires is related to the quantity of cookies she produces and to her total cost of production.

               Our goal in the next several chapters is to study firms’ production and pricing decisions. For this
               purpose, the most important relationship in Table 1 is between quantity produced (in the second
               column)  and  total  costs  (in  the  sixth  column).  Panel  (b)  of  Figure  2  graphs  these  two
               columns of data with the quantity produced on the horizontal axis and total cost on the
               vertical axis. This graph is called the total-cost curve.

               Now compare the total-cost curve in panel (b) with the production function in panel (a). These
               two curves  are  opposite  sides  of the same coin.  The total-cost curve  gets steeper as the
               amount produced rises, whereas the production function gets flatter as production rises.
               These  changes  in  slope  occur  for  the  same  reason.  High  production  of  cookies  means  that
               Caroline’s  kitchen  is  crowded  with  many  workers.  Because  the  kitchen  is  crowded,  each
               additional  worker  adds  less  to  production,  reflecting  diminishing  marginal  product.
               Therefore, the production function is relatively flat. But now turn this logic around: When the
               kitchen is crowded, producing an additional cookie requires a lot of additional labor and is thus
               very  costly.  Therefore,  when  the  quantity  produced  is  large,  the  total-cost  curve  is
               relatively steep.

               One of the Ten Principles of Economics introduced in Chapter 1 is that rational people think at
               the  margin.  As  we  will  see  in  future  chapters,  this  idea  is  the  key  to  understanding  the
               decisions  a  firm  makes  about  how  many  workers  to  hire  and  how  much  output  to
               produce. To take a step toward understanding these decisions, the third column in the table
               gives the marginal product of a worker.

               The marginal product of any input in the production process is the increase in the quantity of
               output obtained from one additional unit of that input. When the number of workers goes from 1
               to 2, cookie production increases from 50 to 90, so the marginal product of the second worker is
               40 cookies. And when the number of workers goes from 2 to 3, cookie  production increases
               from  90  to  120,  so  the  marginal  product  of  the  third  worker  is  30  cookies.  In  the  table,  the
               marginal  product  is  shown  halfway  between  two  rows  because  it  represents  the  change  in
               output as the number of workers increases from one level to another.

                        Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus  BMGT21: Basic Microeconomics


               Notice  that  as  the  number  of  workers  increases,  the  marginal  product  declines.  The  second
               worker has  a marginal product  of 40 cookies, the third worker has  a marginal product of 30
               cookies, and the fourth worker has  a marginal product of 20 cookies. This property is called
               diminishing marginal product. At first, when only a few workers are hired, they have easy
               access to Caroline’s kitchen equipment. As the number of workers increases, additional workers
               have to share  equipment and work in more crowded conditions. Eventually, the kitchen is so
               crowded that the workers start getting in each other’s way. Hence, as more and more workers
               are hired, each additional worker contributes fewer additional cookies to total production.

               Diminishing marginal product is also apparent in Figure 2. The production function’s slope
               (“rise over run”) tells us the change in Caroline’s output of cookies (“rise”) for each additional
               input of labor (“run”). That is, the slope of the production function measures the marginal
               product of a worker. As the number of workers increases, the marginal product declines,
               and the production function becomes flatter.

               THE VARIOUS MEASURES OF COSTS

               1.  FIXED AND VARIABLE COSTS
               Total cost can be divided into two types. Some costs, called fixed costs, do not vary with the
               quantity of output produced. They are incurred even if the firm produces nothing at all.

               Some of the firm’s costs, called variable costs, change as the firm alters the quantity of output
               produced.

               The  fourth  column  of  the  table  shows  Conrad’s  variable  cost.  The  variable  cost  is  0  if  he
               produces nothing, $0.30 if he produces 1 cup of coffee, $0.80 if he produces 2 cups, and so on.

               A firm’s total cost is the sum of fixed and variable costs. In Table 2, total cost in the second
               column equals fixed cost in the third column plus variable cost in the fourth column.

               2.  AVERAGE AND MARGINAL COST

               As the owner of his firm, Conrad has to decide how much to produce. A key part of this decision
               is how his costs will vary as he changes the level of production. In making this decision, Conrad
               might  ask  his  production  supervisor  the  following  two  questions  about  the  cost  of  producing
               coffee:

               • How much does it cost to make the typical cup of coffee?
               • How much does it cost to increase production of coffee by 1 cup?

               Total cost divided by the quantity of output is called average total cost. Because total cost is
               the sum of fixed and variable costs, average total cost can be expressed as the sum of average
               fixed  cost  and  average  variable  cost.  Average  fixed  cost  is  the  fixed  cost  divided  by  the
               quantity of  output, and  average variable cost is the variable cost divided by the quantity of
               output.



                                                            136]]></page><page Index="406"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY             Department of Management
                        Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus  BMGT21: Basic Microeconomics


               Although average total cost tells us the cost of the typical unit, it does not tell us how much total
               cost will change as the firm alters its level of production.  The last column in Table 2 shows the
               amount that total cost rises when the firm increases production by 1 unit of output. This
               number is called marginal cost. For example, if Conrad increases production from 2 to 3 cups,
               total  cost rises  from $3.80 to $4.50, so the marginal cost  of the third cup of coffee is $4.50
               minus  $3.80,  or  $0.70.  In  the  table,  the  marginal  cost  appears  halfway  between  two  rows
               because it represents the change in total cost as quantity of output increases from one level to
               another.

               It may be helpful to express these definitions mathematically:

                                           Average total cost = Total cost/Quantity

                                                        ATC = TC/Q

                                                            And

                                   Marginal cost = Change in total cost/Change in quantity

                                                       MC = ∆TC/∆Q.


               Here ∆, the Greek letter delta, represents the change in a variable. These equations show how
               average total cost and marginal cost are derived from total cost.

               Average  total  cost  tells  us  the  cost  of  a  typical  unit  of  output  if  total  cost  is  divided
               evenly over all the units produced.

               Marginal cost tells us the increase in total cost that arises from producing an additional
               unit of output.

               As we will see more fully in the next chapter, business managers like Conrad need to keep in
               mind the concepts of  average total cost and marginal cost when deciding how much of their
               product to supply to the market.

               3.  COST CURVES AND THEIR SHAPES
               Just as in previous lessons we found graphs of supply and demand useful when analyzing the
               behavior of markets, we will find graphs of average and marginal cost useful when analyzing the
               behavior of firms. Figure 4 graphs Conrad’s costs using the data from Table 2. The horizontal
               axis  measures  the  quantity  the  firm  produces,  and  the  vertical  axis  measures  marginal  and
               average costs. The graph shows four curves: average total cost (ATC), average fixed cost
               (AFC), average variable cost (AVC), and marginal cost (MC).

               The cost curves shown here for Conrad’s Coffee Shop have some features that are common to
               the cost curves of many firms in the economy. Let’s examine three features in particular: the

               shape of the marginal-cost curve, the shape of the average-total-cost curve, and the relationship
               between marginal and average total cost.

               Rising Marginal Cost Conrad’s marginal cost rises with the quantity of output produced.
               This reflects the property of diminishing marginal product. When Conrad produces a small
               quantity of coffee, he has few workers, and much of his equipment is not used. Because he can
               easily put these idle resources to use, the marginal product of an extra worker is large, and the
               marginal cost of  an extra cup of coffee is small. By contrast, when Conrad produces  a large
               quantity of coffee, his shop is crowded with workers, and most of his equipment is fully utilized.

               Conrad can produce more coffee by adding workers, but these new workers have to work in
               crowded conditions and may have to wait to use the equipment. Therefore, when the quantity of
               coffee  produced  is  already  high,  the  marginal  product  of  an  extra  worker  is  low,  and  the
               marginal cost of an extra cup of coffee is large.

               U-Shaped Average Total Cost  Conrad’s  average-total-cost curve is U-shaped,  as  shown in
               Figure 4. To understand why, remember that average total cost is the sum of average fixed cost
               and average variable cost. Average fixed cost always declines as output rises because the
               fixed cost is spread over a larger number of units. Average variable cost typically rises
               as output increases because of diminishing marginal product Average total cost reflects
               the  shapes  of  both  average  fixed  cost  and  average  variable  cost.  At  very  low  levels  of
               output, such as 1  or 2 cups per hour,  average total cost is very high. Even though  average
               variable cost is low, average fixed cost is high because the fixed cost is spread over only a few
               units. As output increases, the fixed cost is spread more widely. Average fixed cost declines,
               rapidly at first and then more slowly. As a result, average total cost also declines until the firm’s
               output reaches 5 cups of coffee per hour, when average total cost is $1.30 per cup.

               When the firm produces more than 6 cups per hour, however, the increase in average variable
               cost becomes the dominant force, and average total cost starts rising.

               The tug of war between average fixed cost and average variable cost generates the U-shape in
               average  total  cost.  The  bottom  of  the  U-shape  occurs  at  the  quantity  that  minimizes
               average total cost. This quantity is sometimes called the efficient scale of the firm. For
               Conrad, the efficient scale is 5 or 6 cups of coffee per hour. If he produces more or less than
               this amount, his average total cost rises above the minimum of $1.30. At lower levels of output,
               average total cost is higher than $1.30 because the fixed cost is spread over so few units. At
               higher levels of output, average total cost is higher than $1.30 because the marginal product of
               inputs has diminished significantly. At the efficient scale, these two forces are balanced to yield
               the lowest average total cost.

               The Relationship between Marginal Cost and Average Total Cost If you look at Figure 4 (or
               back at Table 2), you will see something that may be surprising at first. Whenever marginal cost
               is less than average total cost, average total cost is falling. Whenever marginal cost is greater



                                                            138]]></page><page Index="408"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY             Department of Management

               than average total cost, average total cost is rising. This feature of Conrad’s cost curves is not a
               coincidence from the particular numbers used in the example: It is true for all firms.

               To  see  why,  consider  an  analogy.  Average  total  cost  is  like  your  cumulative  grade  point
               average. Marginal cost is like the grade in the next course you will take. If your grade in your
               next course is less than  your grade point  average, your grade point average will fall. If your
               grade in your next course is higher than your grade point average, your grade point average will
               rise. The mathematics of average and marginal costs is exactly the same as the mathematics of
               average and marginal grades.

               This  relationship  between  average  total  cost  and  marginal  cost  has  an  important
               corollary: The marginal-cost curve crosses the average-total-cost curve at its minimum.

               Why? At low levels of output, marginal cost is below average total cost, so average total
               cost is falling. But after the two curves cross, marginal cost rises above average total
               cost. For the reason we have just discussed, average total cost must start to rise at this level of
               output. Hence, this point of intersection is the minimum of average total cost. As you will see in
               the next chapter, minimum average total cost plays  a key  role in the  analysis  of competitive
               firms.

               4. TYPICAL COST CURVES
               In  the  examples  we  have  studied  so  far,  the  firms  exhibit  diminishing marginal  product  and,
               therefore,  rising  marginal  cost  at  all  levels  of  output. This  simplifying  assumption  was  useful
               because  it  allowed  us  to  focus  on  the  key  features  of  cost  curves  that  will  prove  useful  in
               analyzing firm behavior. Yet actual firms are usually more complicated than this. In many firms,
               marginal  product  does  not  start  to  fall  immediately  after  the  first  worker  is  hired.
               Depending on the production process, the second or third worker might have a higher
               marginal  product  than  the  first  because  a  team  of workers  can  divide  tasks  and work
               more productively than a single worker.

               Firms exhibiting this pattern would experience increasing marginal product for a while before
               diminishing marginal product set in. Figure 5 shows the cost curves for such a firm, including
               average total cost (ATC), average fixed cost (AFC), average variable cost (AVC), and marginal
               cost (MC). At low levels  of  output, the firm experiences increasing marginal product, and the
               marginal-cost curve falls. Eventually, the firm starts to experience diminishing marginal product,
               and  the  marginal-cost  curve  starts  to  rise.  This  combination  of  increasing  then  diminishing
               marginal product also makes the average-variable-cost curve U-shaped.

               Despite these differences  from our previous  example, the cost curves shown here  share the
               three properties that are most important to remember:

               • Marginal cost eventually rises with the quantity of output.

               COSTS IN THE SHORT RUN AND IN THE LONG RUN



               THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SHORT-RUN
               AND LONG-RUN AVERAGE TOTAL COST
               For many firms, the division of total costs between fixed and variable costs depend on the time
               horizon.  Consider,  for  instance,  a  car  manufacturer  such  as  Ford  Motor  Company.  Over  a
               period of only a few months, Ford cannot adjust the number or sizes of its car factories. The
               only way it can produce additional cars is to hire more workers at the factories it already has.
               The cost of these  factories is, therefore,  a  fixed cost  in the short run. By contrast, over  a
               period of several years, Ford can expand the size of its factories, build new factories, or close
               old ones.


               Thus, the cost of its factories is a variable cost in the long run. Because many decisions
               are fixed in the short run but variable in the long run, a firm’s long-run cost curves differ from its
               short-run cost curves. Figure 6 shows an example. The figure presents three short-run average-
               total-cost curves—for a small, medium, and large factory. It also presents the long-run average-
               total-cost curve. As the firm moves along the long-run curve, it is adjusting the size of the factory
               to the quantity of production.


               This graph shows how short-run and long-run costs are related. The long-run average-total-cost
               curve is a much flatter U-shape than the short-run average total-cost curve. In addition, all the
               short-run curves lie on or above the long-run curve. These properties arise because firms have
               greater flexibility in the long run.

               In essence, in the long run, the firm gets to choose which short-run curve it wants to use. But in
               the short run, it has to use whatever short-run curve it has chosen in the past. The figure shows
               an example of how a change in production alters costs over different time horizons.

               When Ford wants to increase production from 1,000 to 1,200 cars per day, it has no choice in
               the  short  run  but  to  hire more workers  at  its  existing  medium-sized factory.  Because  of
               diminishing marginal product, average total cost rises from $10,000 to $12,000 per car. In
               the  long  run,  however,  Ford  can  expand  both  the  size  of  the  factory  and  its workforce,  and
               average total cost returns to $10,000.

               How long does it take a firm to get to the long run? The answer depends on the firm. It can
               take a year or longer for a major manufacturing firm, such as a car company, to build a larger
               factory. By contrast, a person running a coffee shop can buy another coffee maker within a few
               hours.  There  is,  therefore,  no  single  answer  to  how  long  it  takes  a  firm  to  adjust  its
               production facilities.


               ECONOMIES AND DISECONOMIES OF SCALE
               The  shape  of  the  long-run  average-total-cost  curve  conveys  important  information  about  the
               production processes that a firm has available for manufacturing a good. In particular, it tells us

                                                            142]]></page><page Index="412"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY             Department of Management

               how  costs  vary  with  the  scale—that  is,  the  size—of  a  firm’s  operations.  When  long-run
               average total cost declines as output increases, there are said to be economies of scale.
               When  long-run  average  total  cost  rises  as  output  increases,  there  are  said  to  be
               diseconomies  of  scale.  When  long-run  average  total  cost  does  not  vary  with  the  level  of
               output, there are said to be constant returns to scale. In this example, Ford has economies of
               scale  at  low  levels  of  output, constant  returns  to  scale  at  intermediate  levels  of  output,  and
               diseconomies of scale at high levels of output. What might cause economies or diseconomies of
               scale?

               Economies  of  scale  often  arise  because  higher  production  levels  allow  specialization
               among  workers,  which  permits  each  worker  to  become  better  at  a  specific  task.  For
               instance, if Ford hires a large number of workers and produces a large number of cars, it can
               reduce  costs  with  modern  assembly-line  production.  Diseconomies  of  scale  can  arise
               because of coordination problems that are inherent in any large organization. The more
               cars Ford produces, the more stretched the management team becomes, and the less effective
               the managers become at keeping costs down.

               This analysis shows why long-run average-total-cost curves are often U-shaped. At low levels of
               production,  the  firm  benefits  from  increased  size  because  it  can  take  advantage  of  greater
               specialization. Coordination problems, meanwhile, are not yet acute. By contrast, at high levels
               of  production,  the  benefits  of  specialization  have  already  been  realized,  and  coordination
               problems become more severe  as the firm grows larger. Thus, long-run average total cost is
               falling at low levels of production because of increasing specialization and rising at high levels of
               production because of increasing coordination problems.

               CONCLUSION

               The purpose of this lesson has been to develop some tools that we can use to study how firms
               make production and pricing decisions. You should now understand what economists mean by
               the term costs and how costs vary with the quantity of output a firm produces. To refresh your
               memory, Table 3 summarizes some of the definitions we have encountered. By themselves, a
               firm’s cost curves do not tell us what decisions the firm will make. But they  are an important
               component of that decision, as we will begin to see in the next lesson.

               SUMMARY


               The goal of firms is to maximize profit, which equals total revenue minus total cost.

                     When analyzing a firm’s behavior, it is important to include all the opportunity costs of
                       production. Some of the opportunity costs, such as the wages a firm pays its workers,
                       are  explicit.  Other  opportunity  costs,  such  as  the  wages  the  firm  owner  gives  up  by
                       working in the firm rather than taking another job, are implicit.
                     A  firm’s  costs  reflect  its  production  process.  A  typical  firm’s  production  function  gets
                       flatter  as  the  quantity  of  an  input  increases,  displaying  the  property  of  diminishing
                       marginal  product.  As  a  result,  a  firm’s  total-cost  curve  gets  steeper  as  the  quantity
                       produced rises.


                                                            144]]></page><page Index="414"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY             Department of Management

                     A firm’s total costs can be divided between fixed costs and variable costs. Fixed costs
                       are  costs  that  do  not  change  when  the  firm  alters  the  quantity  of  output  produced.
                       Variable  costs  are  costs  that  change  when  the  firm  alters  the  quantity  of  output
                       produced.
                     From a firm’s total cost, two related measures of cost are derived. Average total cost is
                       total cost divided by the quantity of output. Marginal cost is the amount by which total
                       cost rises if output increases by 1 unit. When analyzing firm behavior, it is often useful to
                       graph average total cost and marginal cost. For a typical firm, marginal cost rises with
                       the quantity of output. Average total cost first falls as output increases and then rises as
                       output increases further. The marginal-cost curve always crosses the average-total-cost
                       curve at the minimum of average total cost.
                     A firm’s costs often depend on the time horizon considered. In particular, many costs are
                       fixed in the short run but variable in the long run. As a result, when the firm changes its
                       level of production, average total cost may rise more in the short run than in the long run.



               QUESTIONS FOR REVIEW:


               1.  What is the relationship between the total revenue, profit, and total cost?

               2. Give an example of an opportunity cost that an accountant might not count as a cost. Why
               would the accountant ignore this cost?

               3. What is marginal product, and what does it mean if it is diminishing?


               4.  Draw  a  production  function  that  exhibits  diminishing  marginal  product  of  labor.  Draw  the
               associated total-cost curve. (In both cases, be sure to label the axes.) Explain the shapes of the
               two curves you have drawn.

               5. Define total cost, average total cost, and marginal cost. How are they related?

               6. How and why does a firm’s average-total-cost curve differ in the short run and in the long
               run?

               7. Define economies of scale and explain why they might arise. Define diseconomies of scale
               and explain why they might arise.

               WEEK 13

               LESSON: ORGANIZATION OF INDUSTRY:  Market Structures

               Learning Objectives:

               After the completion of the chapter, you should be able to:

               1.  Explain the meaning of competitive markets

               2.  Explain the characteristics of competitive market

               3.  Determine the Firm’s Short-Run Decision to Shut Down Operation

               4.  Determine the Firm’s Long-Run Decision to Enter/Exit the Market

               Overview:

               Firms in Competitive Markets


                       If your local gas station raised its price for gasoline by 20 percent, it would see a large
               drop  in  the  amount  of  gasoline  it  sold.  Its  customers  would  quickly  switch  to  buying  their
               gasoline at other gas stations. By contrast, if your local water company raised the price of water
               by 20 percent, it would see only a small decrease in the amount of water it sold. People might
               water their lawns less often and buy more water-efficient showerheads, but they would be hard-
               pressed to reduce water consumption greatly and would be unlikely to find another supplier. The
               difference between the gasoline market  and the water market is  obvious: Many firms supply
               gasoline  to  the  local  market,  but  only  one  firm  supplies  water.  As  you  might  expect,  this
               difference  in  market  structure  shapes  the  pricing  and  production  decisions  of  the  firms  that
               operate in these markets.

                       In  this lesson,  we  examine  the  behavior  of  competitive  firms,  such  as  your  local  gas
               station. You may recall that a market is competitive if each buyer and seller is small compared
               to the size of the market and, therefore, has little ability to influence market prices. By contrast, if
               a firm can influence the market price of the good it sells, it is said to have market power. Later in
               the  book,  we  examine  the  behavior  of  firms  with  market  power,  such  as  your  local  water
               company.

                       Our  analysis  of  competitive  firms  in  this  lesson  sheds  light  on  the  decisions  that  lie
               behind  the  supply  curve  in  a  competitive  market.  Not  surprisingly, we  will  find that  a market
               supply  curve  is  tightly  linked  to  firms’  costs  of  production.  Less  obvious,  however,  is  the
               question of which among a firm’s many types of cost— fixed, variable, average, and marginal—
               are most relevant for its supply decisions.


               We will see that all these measures of cost play important and interrelated roles.

               DISCUSSION:

               WHAT IS A COMPETITIVE MARKET?
               Our  goal  in  this  chapter  is  to  examine  how  firms  make  production  decisions  in  competitive
               markets. As a background for this analysis, we begin by reviewing what a competitive market is.

               THE MEANING OF COMPETITION
               A  competitive  market,  sometimes  called  a  perfectly  competitive  market,  has  two
               characteristics:


               • There are many buyers and many sellers in the market.

               • The goods offered by the various sellers are largely the same.

               As a result of these conditions, the actions of any single buyer or seller in the market have a
               negligible impact on the market price. Each buyer and seller takes the market price as given.
               As an example, consider the market for milk. No single consumer of milk can influence the price
               of  milk  because  each  buyer  purchases  a  small  amount  relative  to  the  size  of  the  market.
               Similarly, each dairy farmer has limited control over the price because many other sellers are
               offering milk that is essentially identical. Because each seller can sell all he wants at the going
               price, he has little reason to charge less, and if he charges more, buyers will go elsewhere.
               Buyers and sellers in competitive markets must accept the price the market determines
               and, therefore, are said to be price takers.

               In addition to the foregoing two conditions for competition, there is a third condition sometimes
               thought to characterize perfectly competitive markets:

               • Firms can freely enter or exit the market.

               If, for instance,  anyone can decide to start  a dairy farm, and if any existing dairy farmer can
               decide to leave the dairy business, then the dairy industry would satisfy this condition. Much of
               the analysis of competitive firms does not need the assumption of free entry and exit because
               this  condition  is  not  necessary  for  firms  to  be  price  takers.  Yet,  as  we  will  see  later  in  this
               chapter, if there is free entry and exit in a competitive market, it is a powerful force shaping the
               long-run equilibrium.

               THE REVENUE OF A COMPETITIVE FIRM

               A firm in a competitive market, like most other  firms in the economy, tries to maximize profit
               (total  revenue  minus  total  cost).  To  see  how  it  does  this,  we  first consider  the  revenue  of  a
               competitive firm. To keep matters concrete, let’s consider a specific firm: the Vaca Family Dairy
               Farm.






                                                            147]]></page><page Index="417"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY             Department of Management

               The Vaca Farm produces a quantity of milk, Q, and sells each unit at the market price, P. The
               farm’s total revenue is P × Q. For example, if a gallon of milk sells for $6 and the farm sells
               1,000 gallons, its total revenue is $6,000.

               Because the Vaca Farm is small compared to the world market for milk, it takes the price as
               given by market conditions. This means, in particular, that the price of milk does not depend on
               the number of gallons that the Vaca Farm produces and sells. If the Vacas double the amount of
               milk they produce to 2,000 gallons, the price of milk remains the same, and their total revenue
               doubles to $12,000. As a result, total revenue is proportional to the amount of output.

               Table 1 shows the revenue for the Vaca Family Dairy Farm. The first two columns show the
               amount of output the farm produces and the price at which it sells its output. The third column is
               the farm’s total revenue. The table assumes that the price of milk is $6 a gallon, so total revenue
               is $6 times the number of gallons.

               Just  as  the  concepts  of  average  and  marginal  were  useful  in  the  preceding  chapter  when
               analyzing costs, they are also useful when analyzing revenue. To see what these concepts tell
               us, consider these two questions:


               • How much revenue does the farm receive for the typical gallon of milk?

               • How much additional revenue does the farm receive if it increases production of milk by 1
               gallon?


               The last two columns in Table 1 answer these questions.

               The fourth column in the table shows average revenue, which is total revenue (from the third
               column) divided by the amount of output (from the first column). Average revenue tells us how
               much revenue  a firm receives for the typical unit sold. In Table 1, you can see that  average
               revenue equals $6, the price of a gallon of milk. This illustrates a general lesson that applies not
               only to competitive firms but to other firms as well. Average revenue is total revenue (P × Q)
               divided by the quantity (Q). Therefore,  for all firms, average revenue equals the price of the
               good.

               The fifth column shows marginal revenue, which is the change in total revenue from the sale of
               each additional unit of output. In Table 1, marginal revenue equals $6, the price of a gallon of
               milk. This result illustrates a lesson that applies only to competitive firms. Total revenue is  P ×
               Q, and P is fixed for a competitive firm. Therefore, when Q rises by 1 unit, total revenue rises by
               P dollars. For competitive firms, marginal revenue equals the price of the good.

               PROFIT MAXIMIZATION AND THE COMPETITIVE FIRM’S SUPPLY
               CURVE
               The goal of a competitive firm is to maximize profit, which equals total revenue minus total cost.
               We  have  just  discussed  the  firm’s  revenue,  and  in  the  preceding  chapter, we  discussed  the
               firm’s costs. We are now ready to examine how a competitive firm maximizes profit and how
               that decision determines its supply curve.


               A SIMPLE EXAMPLE OF PROFIT MAXIMIZATION
               Let’s begin our analysis of the firm’s supply decision with the example in Table 2. In the first
               column of the table is the number of gallons of milk the Vaca Family Dairy Farm produces. The
               second column shows the farm’s total revenue, which is $6 times the number of gallons. The
               third column shows the farm’s total cost. Total cost includes fixed costs, which are $3 in this
               example, and variable costs, which depend on the quantity produced.

               The fourth column shows the farm’s profit, which is computed by subtracting total cost from total
               revenue. If the farm produces nothing, it has a loss of $3 (its fixed cost). If it produces 1 gallon, it
               has a profit of $1. If it produces 2 gallons, it has a profit of  $4 and so on. Because the Vaca
               family’s goal is to maximize profit, it chooses to produce the quantity of milk that makes profit as
               large as possible. In this example, profit is maximized when the farm produces 4 or 5 gallons of
               milk, for a profit of $7.

               There  is  another  way  to  look  at  the  Vaca  Farm’s  decision:  The  Vacas  can  find  the  profit-
               maximizing  quantity  by  comparing  the  marginal  revenue  and  marginal  cost  from  each  unit
               produced. The fifth and sixth columns in Table 2 compute marginal revenue and marginal cost
               from the changes in total revenue and total cost, and the last column shows the change in profit
               for each additional gallon produced. The first gallon of milk the farm produces has a marginal

                                                            149]]></page><page Index="419"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY             Department of Management

               revenue of $6 and a marginal cost of $2; hence, producing that gallon increases profit by $4
               (from –$3 to $1). The second gallon produced has a marginal revenue of $6 and a marginal cost
               of  $3,  so  that  gallon  increases  profit  by  $3  (from  $1  to  $4).  As  long  as  marginal  revenue
               exceeds marginal cost, increasing the quantity produced raises profit. Once the Vaca Farm has
               reached  5  gallons  of  milk,  however,  the  situation  changes.  The  sixth  gallon  would  have  a
               marginal revenue  of $6 and  a marginal cost of $7, so producing it would reduce profit by $1
               (from $7 to $6). As a result, the Vacas would not produce beyond 5 gallons.

               One of the Ten Principles of Economics in Chapter 1 is that rational people think at the margin.
               We now see how the Vaca Family Dairy Farm can apply this principle. If marginal revenue is
               greater  than  marginal  cost—as  it  is  at  1,  2,  or  3  gallons—the  Vacas  should  increase  the
               production of milk because it will put more money in their pockets (marginal revenue) than it
               takes out (marginal cost).

               If marginal revenue is less than marginal cost—as it is at 6, 7, or 8 gallons—the Vacas should
               decrease production. If the Vacas think at the margin and make incremental adjustments to the
               level of production, they are naturally led to produce the profit-maximizing quantity



































               THE MARGINAL-COST CURVE AND THE FIRM’S SUPPLY DECISION
               To extend this analysis of profit maximization, consider the cost curves in Figure

               1. These cost curves have the three features that, as we discussed in the previous chapter, are
               thought to describe most firms: The marginal-cost curve (MC) is upward sloping. The average-
               total-cost curve (ATC) is U-shaped. And the marginal-cost curve crosses the average-total-cost

                                                            150]]></page><page Index="420"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY             Department of Management
                        Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus  BMGT21: Basic Microeconomics


               curve at the minimum of average total cost. The figure also shows a horizontal line at the market
               price (P). The price line is horizontal because the firm is a price taker: The price of the firm’s
               output is the same regardless of the quantity that the firm decides to produce. Keep in
               mind that, for a competitive firm, the firm’s price equals both its average revenue (AR) and its
               marginal revenue (MR).

               We can use Figure 1 to find the quantity of output that maximizes profit. Imagine that the firm is
               producing at Q1. At this level of output, marginal revenue is greater than marginal cost. That is,
               if the firm raised its level of production and sales by 1 unit, the additional revenue (MR1) would
               exceed  the  additional  cost  (MC1). Profit,  which  equals  total  revenue  minus  total  cost,  would
               increase.

               Hence, if marginal revenue is greater than marginal cost, as it is at  Q1, the firm can increase
               profit by increasing production. A similar argument applies when output is at  Q2. In this case,
               marginal cost is greater than marginal  revenue. If the firm reduced production by 1 unit, the
               costs saved (MC2) would exceed the revenue lost (MR2). Therefore, if marginal revenue is less
               than marginal cost, as it is at Q2, the firm can increase profit by reducing production.

               Where do these marginal adjustments to production end? Regardless of whether the firm begins
               with  production  at  a  low  level  (such  as  Q1)  or  at  a  high  level  (such  as  Q2),  the  firm  will
               eventually  adjust  production  until the  quantity  produced  reaches  QMAX.  This  analysis  yields
               three general rules for profit maximization:

               • If marginal revenue is greater than marginal cost, the firm should increase its output.

               • If marginal cost is greater than marginal revenue, the firm should decrease its output.

               • At the profit-maximizing level of output, marginal revenue and marginal cost are exactly equal.

               These rules are the key to rational decision making by a profit-maximizing firm. They apply not
               only to competitive firms but, as we will see in the next chapter, to other types of firms as well.

               We can  now  see  how  the  competitive  firm  decides  the  quantity  of  its  good  to  supply  to  the
               market.  Because  a  competitive  firm  is  a  price  taker,  its marginal  revenue  equals  the  market
               price. For any given price, the competitive firm’s profit maximizing quantity of output is found by
               looking at the intersection of the price with the marginal-cost curve. In Figure 1, that quantity of
               output is QMAX.

               Suppose that the price prevailing in this market rises, perhaps because of an increase in market
               demand. Figure 2 shows how a competitive firm responds to the price increase. When the price
               is P1, the firm produces quantity Q1, the quantity that equates marginal cost to the price. When
               the price rises to P2, the firm finds that marginal revenue is now higher than marginal cost at the
               previous level of output, so the firm increases production. The new profit-maximizing quantity is
               Q2,  at  which  marginal  cost  equals  the  new  higher  price.  In  essence,  because  the  firm’s
               marginal-cost curve determines the quantity of the good the firm is willing to supply at any price,

                                                            151]]></page><page Index="421"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY             Department of Management

               the marginal-cost curve is also the competitive firm’s supply curve. There are, however, some
               caveats to that conclusion, which we examine next.


               THE FIRM’S SHORT-RUN DECISION TO SHUT DOWN
               So far, we have been analyzing the question of how much a competitive firm will produce. In
               certain circumstances, however, the firm will decide to shut down and not produce anything at
               all.

               Here we should distinguish between a temporary shutdown of a firm and the permanent exit of a
               firm from the market. A shutdown refers to a short-run decision not to produce anything during
               a specific period of time because of current market conditions. Exit refers to a long-run decision
               to  leave  the  market.  The  short-run  and  long-run  decisions  differ  because  most  firms  cannot
               avoid their fixed costs in the short run but can do so in the long run. That is, a firm that shuts
               down temporarily still has to pay its fixed costs, whereas a firm that exits the market does not
               have to pay any costs at all, fixed or variable.

               For example, consider the production decision that a farmer faces. The cost of the land is one of
               the farmer’s fixed costs. If the farmer decides not to produce any crops one season, the land
               lies fallow, and he cannot recover this cost. When making the short-run decision whether to shut
               down for a season, the fixed cost of land is said to be a sunk cost. By contrast, if the farmer
               decides to leave farming altogether, he can sell the land. When making the long-run decision
               whether to exit the market, the cost of land is not sunk. (We return to the issue of sunk costs
               shortly.)

               Now let’s consider what determines a firm’s shutdown decision. If the firm shuts down, it loses
               all revenue from the sale of its product. At the same time, it saves the variable costs of making
               its product (but must still pay the fixed costs).

               Thus, the firm shuts down if the revenue that it would get from producing is less than its variable
               costs of production.

               A small bit of mathematics can make this shutdown criterion more useful. If TR stands for total
               revenue and VC stands for variable costs, then the firm’s decision can be written as Shut down
               if TR < VC.

               The firm shuts down if total revenue is less than variable cost. By dividing both sides  of this
               inequality by the quantity Q, we can write it as Shut down if TR / Q < VC / Q. The left side of the
               inequality, TR / Q, is total revenue P × Q divided by quantity Q, which is average revenue, most
               simply expressed  as the good’s price,  P. The right side of the inequality,  VC / Q, is average
               variable cost, AVC. Therefore, the firm’s shutdown criterion can be restated as Shut down if P <
               AVC.


               That is, a firm chooses to shut down if the price of the good is less than the average variable
               cost of production. This criterion is intuitive: When choosing to produce, the firm compares the


                                                            152]]></page><page Index="422"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY             Department of Management

               price it receives for the typical unit to the average variable cost that it must incur to produce the
               typical unit. If the price doesn’t cover the average variable cost, the firm is better off stopping
               production altogether. The firm will be losing money (since it still has to pay fixed costs), but it
               would  lose  even  more  money  staying  open.  The  firm  can  reopen  in  the  future  if  conditions
               change so that price exceeds average variable cost.

               We  now  have  a  full  description  of  a  competitive  firm’s  profit-maximizing  strategy.  If  the  firm
               produces anything, it produces the quantity at which marginal cost equals the price of the good.
               Yet if the price is less than average variable cost at that quantity, the firm is better off shutting
               down and not producing anything.

               These results are illustrated in Figure 3.  The competitive firm’s short-run supply curve is the
               portion of its marginal-cost curve that lies above average variable cost.

               Sometime in your life you may have been told, “Don’t cry over spilt milk,” or “Let bygones be
               bygones.” These adages hold a deep truth about rational decision making. Economists say that
               a cost is a sunk cost when it has already been committed and cannot be recovered. Because
               nothing  can  be  done  about  sunk  costs,  you  can  ignore  them when  making  decisions  about
               various aspects of life, including business strategy.


               Our analysis of the firm’s shutdown decision is one example of the irrelevance of sunk costs.
               We assume that the firm cannot recover its fixed costs by temporarily stopping production. That
               is, regardless of the quantity of output supplied, and even if it is zero, the firm still has to pay its
               fixed costs. As a result, the fixed costs are sunk in the short run, and the firm can ignore them
               when  deciding  how  much  to  produce.  The  firm’s  short-run  supply  curve  is  the  part  of  the
               marginal cost curve that lies above average variable cost, and the size of the fixed cost does not
               matter for this supply decision.


               The irrelevance of sunk costs is also important when making personal decisions. Imagine, for
               instance, that you place a $15 value on seeing a newly released movie. You buy a ticket for
               $10, but before entering the theater, you lose the ticket.

               Should you buy another ticket? Or should you now go home and refuse to pay a total of $20 to
               see the movie? The  answer is that you should buy  another ticket. The  benefit  of seeing the
               movie ($15) still exceeds the opportunity cost (the $10 for the second ticket). The $10 you paid
               for the lost ticket is a sunk cost. As with spilt milk, there is no point in crying about it.

               In making the decision whether to open for lunch, a restaurant owner must keep in mind the
               distinction between fixed and variable costs. Many of a restaurant’s costs—the rent, kitchen
               equipment, tables, plates, silverware, and so on—are fixed. Shutting down during lunch would
               not reduce these costs. In other words, these costs are sunk in the short run. When the owner is
               deciding whether to serve lunch, only the variable costs—the price of the additional food and the



                                                            153]]></page><page Index="423"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY             Department of Management

               wages of the extra staff—are relevant. The owner shuts down the restaurant at lunchtime only if
               the revenue from the few lunchtime customers fails to cover the restaurant’s variable costs.

               An operator of a miniature-golf course in a summer resort community faces a similar decision.
               Because  revenue  varies  substantially  from  season  to  season,  the  firm must  decide  when  to
               open and when to close. Once again, the fixed costs— the costs of buying the land and building
               the course—are irrelevant in making this decision. The miniature-golf course should be open for
               business only during those times of year when its revenue exceeds its variable costs.


               THE FIRM’S LONG-RUN DECISION
               TO EXIT OR ENTER A MARKET
               A firm’s long-run decision to exit a market is similar to its shutdown decision. If the firm exits, it
               will again lose all revenue from the sale of its product, but now it will save not only its variable
               costs of production but also its fixed costs. Thus, the firm exits the market if the revenue it would
               get from producing is less than its total costs.

               We can again make this criterion more useful by writing it mathematically. If TR stands for total
               revenue, and TC stands for total cost, then the firm’s exit criterion can be written as

                                                      Exit if TR < TC.

               The firm exits if total revenue is less than total cost. By dividing both sides of this inequality
               by quantity Q, we can write it as

                                                   Exit if TR / Q < TC / Q.

               We can simplify this further by noting that TR / Q is average revenue, which equals the price P,
               and that TC / Q is average total cost, ATC. Therefore, the firm’s exit criterion is

                                                       Exit if P < ATC.

               That is, a firm chooses to exit if the price of its good is less than the average total cost of
               production. A parallel analysis applies to an entrepreneur who is considering starting a firm.
               The firm will enter the market if such an action would be profitable, which occurs if the
               price of the good exceeds the average total cost of production. The entry criterion is

                                                      Enter if P > ATC.

               The criterion for entry is exactly the opposite of the criterion for exit. We can now describe a
               competitive firm’s long-run profit-maximizing strategy.

               If the firm is in the market, it produces the quantity at which marginal cost equals the
               price of the good. Yet if the price is less than average total cost at that quantity, the firm
               chooses to exit (or not enter) the market. These results are illustrated in Figure 4. The

               competitive firm’s long-run supply curve is the portion of its marginal-cost curve that lies above
               average total cost.


               MEASURING PROFIT IN OUR GRAPH FOR
               THE COMPETITIVE FIRM
               As we analyze exit and entry, it is useful to be able to analyze the firm’s profit in more detail.
               Recall that profit equals total revenue (TR) minus total cost (TC):

                                                      Profit = TR – TC.

               We can rewrite this definition by multiplying and dividing the right side by Q:


                                                Profit = (TR / Q – TC / Q) × Q.

               But note that TR / Q is average revenue, which is the price, P, and TC / Q is average total cost,
               ATC. Therefore,


                                                   Profit = (P – ATC) × Q.
               This way of expressing the firm’s profit allows us to measure profit in our graphs. Panel (a) of
               Figure 5 shows a firm earning positive profit. As we have already discussed, the firm maximizes
               profit by producing the quantity at which price equals marginal cost. Now look at the shaded
               rectangle. The height of the rectangle is P – ATC, the difference between price and average
               total cost. The width of the rectangle is  Q, the quantity produced. Therefore, the  area  of the
               rectangle is (P – ATC) × Q, which is the firm’s profit.

               Similarly,  panel  (b)  of  this  figure  shows  a  firm  with  losses  (negative  profit).  In  this  case,
               maximizing profit means minimizing losses, a task accomplished once again by producing the
               quantity at which price equals marginal cost. Now consider the shaded rectangle. The height of
               the rectangle is ATC – P, and the width is Q. The area is (ATC – P) × Q, which is the firm’s loss.
               Because a firm in this situation is not making enough revenue to cover its average total cost, the
               firm would choose in the long run to exit the market.

               CONCLUSION


               The purpose of this lesson has been to develop some tools that we can use to study how firms
               make production and pricing decisions. You should now understand what economists mean by
               the term costs and how costs vary with the quantity of output a firm produces. To refresh your
               memory, Table 3 summarizes some of the definitions we have encountered. By themselves, a
               firm’s cost curves do not tell us what decisions the firm will make. But they  are an important
               component of that decision, as we will begin to see in the next lesson.

               SUMMARY


               The goal of firms is to maximize profit, which equals total revenue minus total cost.

                     When analyzing a firm’s behavior, it is important to include all the opportunity costs of
                       production. Some of the opportunity costs, such as the wages a firm pays its workers,
                       are  explicit.  Other  opportunity  costs,  such  as  the  wages  the  firm  owner  gives  up  by
                       working in the firm rather than taking another job, are implicit.
                     A  firm’s  costs  reflect  its  production  process.  A  typical  firm’s  production  function  gets
                       flatter  as  the  quantity  of  an  input  increases,  displaying  the  property  of  diminishing
                       marginal  product.  As  a  result,  a  firm’s  total-cost  curve  gets  steeper  as  the  quantity
                       produced rises.
                     A firm’s total costs can be divided between fixed costs and variable costs. Fixed costs
                       are  costs  that  do  not  change  when  the  firm  alters  the  quantity  of  output  produced.
                       Variable  costs  are  costs  that  change  when  the  firm  alters  the  quantity  of  output
                       produced.
                     From a firm’s total cost, two related measures of cost are derived. Average total cost is
                       total cost divided by the quantity of output. Marginal cost is the amount by which total
                       cost rises if output increases by 1 unit. When analyzing firm behavior, it is often useful to
                       graph average total cost and marginal cost. For a typical firm, marginal cost rises with
                       the quantity of output. Average total cost first falls as output increases and then rises as
                       output increases further. The marginal-cost curve always crosses the average-total-cost
                       curve at the minimum of average total cost.
                     A firm’s costs often depend on the time horizon considered. In particular, many costs are
                       fixed in the short run but variable in the long run. As a result, when the firm changes its
                       level of production, average total cost may rise more in the short run than in the long run.

               THE SUPPLY CURVE IN A COMPETITIVE MARKET


               Now that we have examined the supply decision  of  a single firm, we can discuss the supply
               curve for a market. There are two cases to consider. First, we examine a market with a fixed
               number of firms. Second, we examine a market in which the number of firms can change as old
               firms exit the market and new firms enter.  Both cases are important, for  each applies over a
               specific time horizon. Over short periods of time, it is often difficult for firms to enter and exit, so
               the  assumption  of  a  fixed  number  of  firms  is  appropriate.  But  over  long  periods  of  time, the
               number of firms can adjust to changing market conditions.

                        Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus  BMGT21: Basic Microeconomics


               THE SHORT RUN: MARKET SUPPLY WITH
               A FIXED NUMBER OF FIRMS
               Consider  first  a  market  with  1,000  identical  firms.  For  any  given  price,  each  firm  supplies  a
               quantity of output so that its marginal cost equals the price, as shown in panel (a) of Figure 6.
               That is, as long as price is above average variable cost, each firm’s marginal-cost curve is its
               supply curve. The quantity of  output supplied to the market equals the sum of the quantities
               supplied by each of the 1,000 individual firms. Thus, to derive the market supply curve, we add
               the quantity supplied by each firm in the market. As panel (b) of Figure 6 shows, because the
               firms are identical, the quantity supplied to the market is 1,000 times the quantity supplied by
               each firm.


               THE LONG RUN: MARKET SUPPLY WITH ENTRY AND EXIT
               Now consider what happens if  firms are  able to  enter  or  exit the market. Let’s suppose that
               everyone has access to the same technology for producing the good and access to the same
               markets to buy the inputs into production. Therefore, all firms and all potential firms have the
               same cost curves.

































               Decisions  about  entry  and  exit  in  a  market  of  this  type  depend  on  the  incentives  facing  the
               owners of existing firms and the entrepreneurs who could start new firms. If firms already in the
               market are profitable, then new firms will have an incentive to enter the market. This entry will
               expand the number of firms, increase the quantity of the good supplied, and drive down prices
               and profits. Conversely, if firms in the market are making losses, then some existing firms will
               exit the market. Their exit will reduce the number of firms, decrease the quantity of the good
               supplied, and drive up prices and profits.  At the end of this process of entry and exit, firms that
               remain in the market must be making zero economic profit.
               Recall that we can write a firm’s profit as

                                                            157]]></page><page Index="427"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY             Department of Management
                        Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus  BMGT21: Basic Microeconomics



                                                   Profit = (P – ATC) × Q.

               This equation shows that an operating firm has zero profit if and only if the price of the good
               equals the  average total cost  of producing that good. If price is above  average total cost,
               profit is positive, which encourages new firms to enter. If price is less than average total
               cost, profit is negative, which encourages some firms to exit. The process of entry and
               exit ends only when price and average total cost are driven to equality.

               This  analysis  has  a  surprising  implication. We  noted  earlier  in  the  chapter  that  competitive
               firms maximize profits by choosing a quantity at which price equals marginal cost. We
               just noted that free entry and exit force price to equal average total cost. But if price is to equal
               both marginal cost and average total cost, these two measures of cost must equal each other.
               Marginal cost and average total cost are equal, however, only when the firm is operating at the
               minimum of average total cost. Recall from the preceding lesson that the level of production
               with lowest average total cost is called the firm’s efficient scale. Therefore, in the long-
               run equilibrium of a competitive market with free entry and exit, firms must be operating
               at their efficient scale.

               Panel (a) of Figure 7 shows a firm in such a long-run equilibrium. In this figure, price P equals
               marginal cost MC, so the firm is profit-maximizing. Price also equals average total cost
               ATC, so profits are zero. New firms have no incentive to enter the market, and existing
               firms have no incentive to leave the market.

               From this analysis of firm behavior, we can determine the long-run supply curve for the market.
               In a market with free entry and exit, there is only one price consistent with zero profit—
               the minimum of average total cost. As a result, the long-run market supply curve must be
               horizontal at this price, as illustrated by the perfectly elastic supply curve in panel (b) of Figure
               7. Any price above this level would generate profit, leading to entry and an increase in the total
               quantity  supplied.  Any  price  below  this  level  would  generate  losses,  leading  to  exit  and  a
               decrease in the total quantity supplied. Eventually, the number of firms in the market adjusts so
               that price equals the minimum of average total cost, and there are enough firms to satisfy all the
               demand at this price.

               WHY DO COMPETITIVE FIRMS STAY IN BUSINESS IF THEY MAKE ZERO PROFIT?

               At first, it might seem odd that competitive firms earn zero profit in the long run. After all, people
               start businesses to make a profit. If entry eventually drives profit to zero, there might seem to be
               little reason to stay in business.

               To understand the zero-profit condition more fully, recall that profit equals total revenue minus
               total cost and that total cost includes all the opportunity costs of the firm. In particular, total cost
               includes  the  time  and  money  that  the  firm  owners  devote  to  the  business.  In  the  zero-profit
               equilibrium,  the  firm’s  revenue  must  compensate  the  owners  for  these  opportunity  costs.
               Consider an example. Suppose that, to start his farm, a farmer had to invest $1 million, which
               otherwise he could have deposited in a bank to earn $50,000 a year in interest. In addition, he
               had  to  give  up  another  job  that  would  have  paid  him  $30,000  a  year.  Then  the  farmer’s
               opportunity cost  of  farming includes both the interest he could have  earned  and the  forgone

                                                            158]]></page><page Index="428"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY             Department of Management

               wages—a total  of $80,000.  Even if his profit is driven to zero, his revenue from farming
               compensates him for these opportunity costs.

               Keep  in  mind  that  accountants  and  economists  measure  costs  differently.  As  we
               discussed in the previous lesson, accountants keep track of explicit costs but not implicit
               costs. That is, they measure costs that require an outflow of money from the firm, but they do
               not include the opportunity costs of production that do not involve an outflow of money.
               As a result, in the zero-profit equilibrium, economic profit is zero, but accounting profit is
               positive.  Our  farmer’s  accountant,  for  instance,  would  conclude  that  the  farmer  earned  an
               accounting profit of $80,000, which is enough to keep the farmer in business.

               A SHIFT IN DEMAND IN THE SHORT RUN
               AND LONG RUN

               Now that we have a more complete understanding of how firms make supply decisions, we can
               better explain how markets respond to changes in demand. Because firms can enter and exit in
               the long run but not in the short run, the response of a market to a change in demand depends
               on the time horizon. To see this, let’s trace the effects of a shift in demand over time.
               Suppose the market for milk begins in a long-run equilibrium. Firms are earning zero profit, so
               price equals the minimum of average total cost. Panel (a) of Figure 8 shows the situation. The
               long-run equilibrium is point A, the quantity sold in the market is Q1, and the price is P1. Now
               suppose scientists discover that milk has miraculous health benefits. As a result, the demand
               curve for milk shifts outward from D1 to D2, as in panel (b). The short-run equilibrium moves
               from point A to point B; as a result, the quantity rises from Q1 to Q2, and the price rises from P1
               to  P2.  All  of  the  existing  firms  respond  to  the  higher  price  by  raising  the  amount  produced.
               Because each firm’s supply curve reflects its marginal-cost curve, how much they each increase
               production is determined by the marginal-cost curve. In the new short-run equilibrium, the price
               of milk exceeds average total cost, so the firms are making positive profit.

               Over time, the profit in this market encourages new firms to enter. Some farmers may switch to
               milk from other farm products, for example. As the number of firms grows, the short-run supply
               curve shifts to the right from S1 to S2, as in panel (c), and this shift causes the price of milk to
               fall. Eventually, the price is driven back down to the minimum of average total cost, profits are
               zero,  and firms stop entering. Thus, the market reaches  a new long-run  equilibrium, point C.
               The price of milk has returned to P1, but the quantity produced has risen to Q3. Each firm is
               again  producing  at  its  efficient  scale,  but  because  more  firms  are  in  the  dairy  business,  the
               quantity of milk produced and sold is higher.

               WHY THE LONG-RUN SUPPLY CURVE MIGHT SLOPE UPWARD

               So far, we have  seen that  entry  and  exit can cause the long-run market supply curve to be
               perfectly  elastic.  The  essence  of  our  analysis  is  that  there  are  a  large  number  of  potential
               entrants, each of which faces the same costs. As a result, the long-run market supply curve is
               horizontal at the minimum of average total cost. When the demand for the good increases,
               the  long-run  result  is  an  increase  in  the  number  of  firms  and  in  the  total  quantity
               supplied, without any change in the price.

               There  are, however, two reasons that the long-run market supply curve  might slope upward.
               The  first  is  that  some  resource  used  in  production  may  be  available  only  in  limited
               quantities. For example, consider the market for farm products. Anyone can choose to buy land
               and start a farm, but the quantity of land is limited. As more people become farmers, the price of
               farmland is bid up, which raises the costs  of  all farmers in the market. Thus, an increase in
               demand for farm products cannot induce an increase in quantity supplied without also inducing
               a rise in farmers’ costs, which in turn means  a rise in  price. The result is a long-run market
               supply curve that is upward sloping, even with free entry into farming.

               A  second  reason  for  an  upward-sloping  supply  curve  is  that  firms may have  different
               costs. For example, consider the market for painters. Anyone can enter the market for painting
               services, but not everyone has the same costs. Costs vary in part because some people work
               faster than others and in part because some people have better alternative uses  of their time
               than others. For any given price, those with lower costs are more likely to enter than those with
               higher costs. To increase the quantity of painting services supplied, additional entrants must be
               encouraged to enter the market. Because these new entrants have higher costs, the price must
               rise  to  make  entry  profitable  for  them.  Thus,  the  long-run  market  supply  curve  for  painting
               services slopes upward even with free entry into the market.

               Notice that if firms have different costs, some firms earn profit even in the long run. In this case,
               the price in the market reflects the average total cost of the  marginal firm—the firm that would
               exit the market if the price were any lower. This firm earns zero profit, but firms with lower costs
               earn positive profit. Entry does not eliminate this profit because would-be entrants have higher
               costs than firms already in the market. Higher-cost firms will enter only if the price rises, making
               the market profitable for them. Thus, for these two reasons, a higher price may be necessary to
               induce a larger quantity supplied, in which case the long-run supply curve is upward sloping
               rather  than  horizontal.  Nonetheless,  the  basic  lesson  about  entry  and  exit  remains  true.
               Because firms can enter and exit more easily in the long run than in the short run, the
               long-run supply curve is typically more elastic than the short-run supply curve.

               QUICK QUIZ In the long run with free entry and exit, is the price in a market equal to
               marginal cost, average total cost, both, or neither? Explain with a diagram.

               CONCLUSION: BEHIND THE SUPPLY CURVE
               We have been discussing the behavior of profit-maximizing firms that supply goods in perfectly
               competitive  markets.  You  may  recall  from  Chapter  1  that  one  of  the  Ten  Principles  of
               Economics is that rational people think at the margin. This  lesson has applied this idea to the
               competitive firm. Marginal analysis has given us a theory of the supply curve in a competitive
               market and, as a result, a deeper understanding of market outcomes.

               We have learned that when you buy a good from a firm in a competitive market, you can be
               assured that the price you pay is close to the cost of producing that good. In particular, if firms
               are competitive and profit maximizing, the price of a good equals the marginal cost of making
               that good. In addition, if firms can freely  enter  and  exit the market, the price also  equals the
               lowest possible average total cost of production.

               Although we have assumed throughout this chapter that firms are price takers, many of the tools
               developed here are also useful for studying firms in less competitive markets. We now turn to an
               examination of the behavior of firms with market power. Marginal analysis will again be useful,
               but it will have quite different implications.

               SUMMARY


                     Because a competitive firm is a price taker, its revenue is proportional to the amount of
                       output it produces. The price of the good equals both the firm’s average revenue and its
                       marginal revenue.
                     To  maximize  profit,  a  firm  chooses  a  quantity  of  output  such  that  marginal  revenue
                       equals  marginal  cost.  Because  marginal  revenue  for  a  competitive  firm  equals  the
                       market  price,  the  firm chooses  quantity  so  that  price  equals  marginal  cost.  Thus, the
                       firm’s marginal-cost curve is its supply curve.
                     In the short run when a firm cannot recover its fixed costs, the firm will choose to shut
                       down temporarily if the price of the good is less than average variable cost. In the long
                       run when the firm can recover both fixed and variable costs, it will choose to exit if the
                       price is less than average total cost.
                     In a market with free entry and exit, profits are driven to zero in the long run. In this long-
                       run  equilibrium,  all  firms  produce  at  the  efficient  scale,  price  equals  the  minimum  of
                       average total cost, and the number of firms adjusts to satisfy the quantity demanded at
                       this price.
                     Changes in demand have different effects over different time horizons. In the short run,
                       an increase in demand raises prices  and leads to profits, and  a decrease in demand
                       lowers prices and leads to losses. But if firms can freely enter and exit the market, then
                       in the long run, the number of firms adjusts to drive the market back  to the zero-profit
                       equilibrium.

               WEEK 14

               LESSON: ORGANIZATION OF INDUSTRY:  Market Structures

               Learning Objectives:

               After studying this chapter you will know how to
               • make use of the concepts market and market forces
               • recognize the point where demand and supply quantities are equal
               • identify different market structures


               Until now I have discussed each of ‘Those two lines’ separately:  demand and supply. In this
               chapter I shall bring them together. Using demand and supply together, you can illustrate how
               markets work efficiently, and you can apply economic theory to many areas of the real life.

               First I shall describe markets and market forces. Then I shall bring them together in a balance of
               demand and supply.

               Discussion

               Competitive markets

               Markets are places where customers meet suppliers. These are not only physical places like
               the local fresh food market or the local stock exchange but also cyberspace markets like eBay
               or NASDAQ. The behaviour  of  customers in a market is represented by the  demand curve
               and the behaviour of suppliers is represented by the supply curve. A competitive market is
               one where customers and suppliers negotiate the price and quantity based on their respective
               goals, free from coercion and outside interference.

               Suppliers want to sell their product at the highest possible price, while customers want to buy
               the product at the lowest possible price. When these two opposing market forces meet, buyer
               and seller have to negotiate until they agree on a price and a quantity. In other words, they have
               to find the price and the quantity at which both the customer is willing to buy and the supplier is
               willing to sell. These agreed figures are called the market clearing price and the market clearing
               quantity.  In  short,  they  have  to  negotiate  until  the  quantity  demanded  and  the  quantity
               supplied are equal. This is represented by  the equilibrium point on the graph, the point of
               intersection of the demand and supply curves.

               Example 1
               Imagine you are at a fairground where, apart from the usual fun activities, there is a tug-of-war.
               On one side there are customers and on the other side there are suppliers. Each side is trying
               to pull the other over a line in the middle. After several attempts by each side to overpower the
               other, they settle at one point where neither side can pull the other any further. At that point they
               have equal strength, they are in balance, they are at the point of equilibrium.



                                                            163]]></page><page Index="433"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY             Department of Management

               Example 2
               One  morning  you  want  to  buy  a  kilo  of  tomatoes  from  a  supplier  at  the  local  fresh  produce
               market. The ticket price is $6 per kilogram but you think the price is too high. You negotiate a
               price reduction which the supplier will accept, but the supplier will only accept it if you agree to
               buy more tomatoes. You settle on a price of $3.50 per kilo for 3.5 kg of fresh tomatoes. Because
               you and the supplier have reached the point of equilibrium, these are the market clearing price
               and the market clearing quantity for tomatoes on this occasion.

               Figure 16 shows this market negotiation process graphically by plotting demand  and  supply
               curves together in one coordinate system.





































               The  market  price  for  tomatoes  started  at  $6  per  kilo  and,  at  that  price,  there  were  6  kg  of
               tomatoes on offer. This is the quantity supplied at Point B. However, at that price there was
               only  demand  for  one  kilo  of  tomatoes,  the  quantity  demanded  at  Point  A.  The  quantity
               supplied was greater than the quantity demanded. At $6 per kilo there was a surplus of 5 kg of
               tomatoes, which is represented by the distance from Point A to Point B.

               Later the price was reduced to $5. At this price suppliers were willing to supply 5 kg but there
               was still an oversupply of tomatoes. There was a surplus of 3 kg which is represented by the
               distance from Point C to Point  F. Further negotiations lead to the next iteration of the price:
               $4 per kilo with 4  kg as the quantity supplied. Finally the customers and suppliers settled on a
               price of $3.50 and a quantity of 3.5 kg where the quantity demanded is equal to quantity
               supplied. They reached the point of equilibrium.



                                                            164]]></page><page Index="434"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY             Department of Management
                        Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus  BMGT21: Basic Microeconomics


               Now imagine that things had gone in the opposite direction. Suppose the morning started with a
               market  price  of  $1  per  kilo.  At  that  price  there  was  1  kg  of  tomatoes  on  offer,  the  quantity
               supplied at Point G.

               At that price there was a demand for 6 kg of tomatoes, the quantity demanded at Point H. The
               quantity supplied was less than the quantity demanded. At $1 per kilo there was a shortage of 5
               kg of tomatoes, which is represented by the distance from Point G to Point H. Later the price
               was  increased  to  $2,  at  which  price  suppliers  were  willing  to  supply  2  kg,  but  the  quantity
               demanded was 5 kg, so there was a shortage of 3 kg, which is represented by the distance from
               Point I to Point J. Further negotiations lead to the next iteration: a price of $3 and a quantity
               demanded  of  4  kg.  Finally  the  customers  and  suppliers  settled  on  a  price  of  $3.50  and  a
               quantity of 3.5 kg where the quantity demanded is equal to quantity supplied. They reached the
               point of equilibrium.

               Summary
               • The market worked well in this example, getting suppliers and customers to the most efficient
               outcome, where the market clearing price and the quantity were established at the equilibrium
               point.
               • Negotiations in the market lead to the establishment of the equilibrium point where the quantity
               demanded and the quantity supplied are equal.
               • Price changes caused movement along the demand and supply curves, ‘Those two lines,’ the
               black and blue lines in Figure 16.

               Remember

               A change in the price of the product itself causes movement along the demand or supply curve;
               all non-price factors cause shifts in the demand or supply curves. But what impact will these
               non-price factors have on negotiations in the marketplace?

               What would happen to prices and to the equilibrium point in a market if there was a change in
               the number of suppliers or the number of customers? You know these non-price factors cause
               shifts of the demand or supply curves, but how would these shifts impact on prices, quantities
               and the equilibrium point? I shall answer these questions in this section by continuing my
               explanation of market functioning.

               I shall start with a change in the number of customers. For example, if you took everyone
               from your class to the market to buy tomatoes, this would cause a shift in the demand curve.
               The  number  of  customers  has  increased,  so  demand  will  increase,  but  supply  will  stay  the
               same. This can be illustrated by a rightward shift of the demand curve while the supply curve
               remains unchanged.

               You know from Figure 14 that the price and quantity originally settled at an equilibrium point,
               $3.50and 3.5 kg, which is represented by Point E on the graph.

               When a non-price factor causes an increase in demand, the original demand curve, the thick
               black line in Figure 17, shifts to a new position, labelled D1 . This corresponds to a move along

               entails an increase in the price of tomatoes from $3.50 to $5 and an increase in quantity from
               3.5 kg to 5 kg.  This causation chain can be summarized as

               in demand

               Increase
               in equilibrium price

               Now assume that the demand curve is unchanged but some non-price factor causes an increase in supply.
               Perhaps an increase in the number of suppliers causes a shift of the supply curve

               It is clear from Figure 19 that an increase in supply would begin a causation chain:

               Different market structures
               In  the  previous  section  I  assumed  that  markets  are  competitive  and  free  from  external
               interventions. I shall now explore different market structures, different sets of market conditions
               under  which  firms  operate.  In  this  section  I  shall  define  two  extreme  market  structures:  the
               perfectly competitive market and the imperfectly competitive market.

               PC: Perfect Competition

               Perfect competition is a useful theoretical concept but, in real life, you will never find a market
               with perfect competition. It is a market structure that is best understood by its assumptions. A
               perfectly competitive market is a market that is characterized by the following conditions:
               • A large number of small firms operate as sellers in the market.
               • There is free entry to the market.
               • There is easy exit from the market.
               • Sellers are price takers. This means they are too small in relation to the size of the market to
               influence the price. A seller must either accept the market price or exit from the market. Such
               sellers are said to ‘meet TINA’ because There Is No Alternative.
               • Firms sell homogeneous products, products that are either identical or so similar that buyers
               are indifferent as to which one they buy.
               • All actors in the market are perfectly well informed. Information about the products is free and
               readily available to every buyer and every seller.

               No market satisfies all these assumptions; nothing in life is perfect; there is no such thing as
               perfect competition. The market that comes closest to being perfectly competitive is probably
               the  market  for  agriculture  produce.  This  market  is  used  in  economics  as  a  benchmark  to
               compare real market structures and assess how far they are from being perfectly competitive.

               As  you  can  see  from  Figure  21,  an  individual  firm  in  a  perfectly  competitive  market  faces  a
               horizontal demand curve. Each firm is a price taker. It is too small to affect the price, so the
               demand is equal to the market price. At that price, each individual firm can sell as much of its
               product as it wants. This also means that demand is perfectly elastic, if a firm increased its price
               by even the smallest amount, it would sell none of its product.

               The blue line in Figure 21 is a supply curve in a perfect market. Sellers will continue to supply
               some of their products only as long as the market price allows them to make a profit. Therefore
               the supply curve is depicted as starting at the market price, the price that each seller has to
               take.

               IC: imperfect competition

               Just as a PC market structure is characterized by meeting a list of assumptions, an IC market
               structure  is  characterized  by  doing  the  opposite.  There  are  several  forms  of  imperfect
               competition, notably a monopoly, which displays the following characteristics:

               • Only one firm acts as a seller in this market.
               • There are barriers to entry. These may be natural, geographic, technological or legal barriers.
               • The firm is a price maker, it sets the price of its own product.
               • The firm is selling a unique product.
               • Information about the product is not freely available.
               Figure 22 illustrates the effect of a monopoly. It refers to marginal costs and marginal revenue,
               which I shall explain in detail in the next chapter.



































               In a monopoly, the firm applies the Profit Maximising Rule: it sets the quantity at Point A where
               the marginal cost is equal to the marginal revenue. It then uses its position as a price maker to
               set the monopoly price at Point B on the demand curve directly above Point A.

               Point B (Q=3 & P=5) represents three units being sold at $5 each. Competition in this market
               would have resulted in four units being sold for $4 each which is represented by Point E (Q=4 &
               P=4).

               There are several forms of imperfect competition

               Barriers to entry define several types of monopoly. For example:

               • A natural monopoly occurs when the type of industry makes it financially impractical, if not
               impossible,  for  multiple  companies  to  engage  in  the  business.  For  example,  it  would  be
               practically impossible for more than  one  firm to supply water to  a city. Each of the potential
               suppliers  would  need  to  build  a  water  supply  infrastructure,  which  would  be  financially  and
               spatially unsustainable.

               •  A  geographic  monopoly,  or  spatial  monopoly,  occurs  when  there  is  only  one  company
               offering a particular good or service in an area. For example, it may financially unsustainable to
               operate more than one general store in a country town because of the small population size.

               • A technological monopoly occurs when a good or service has legal protection in the form of
               a patent or copyright. For example, Apple has a patent to make and sell iPhones.

               • A government can also form a monopoly when, for example, a certain company is given an
               exclusive license to provide a specific service on the government’s behalf.

               WEEK 15

               LESSON: THE ECONOMICS OF LABOR MARKETS

               Learning Objectives:

               In this lesson you will learn the following:
               • The theory of labor markets
               • How wages are determined in an imperfectly competitive labor market
               • How unions affect wages and employment
               • How labor market outcomes are determined under Bilateral Monopoly
               • Theories of Employment Discrimination, and
               • How Immigration affects labor market outcomes

               Overview:
               The Increasing Value of a College Degree

               Working your way through college used to be fairly common in the United States. According to a
               2015  study  by  the  Georgetown  Center  on  Education  and  the  Workforce,  40%  of  college
               students work 30 hours or more per week.

               At the same time, the cost of college seems to rise every year. The data show that the cost of
               tuition,  fees,  room  and  board  has  more  than  doubled  since  1984.  Thus,  even  full  time
               employment  may  not  be  enough  to  cover  college  expenses  anymore.  Working  full  time  at
               minimum wage--40 hours per week, 52 weeks per year—earns $15,080 before taxes, which is
               less than the $19,548 the College Board  estimates it cost in 2016 for  a  year  of college  at  a
               public university. The result of these costs is that student loan debt topped $1.3 trillion this year.

               Despite these disheartening figures, the value of a bachelor’s degree has never been higher.
               How do we explain this? This chapter will tell us.

               Discussion

               In a market  economy like the United States, income comes from ownership of the means  of
               production: resources or assets. More precisely, one’s income is a function of two things: the
               quantity of each resource one owns, and the value society places on those resources. Recall
               from the chapter on Production, Costs, and Industry Structure, each factor of production has
               an associated factor payment. For the majority of us, the most important resource we own is our
               labor. Thus, most of our income is wages, salaries, commissions, tips and other types of labor
               income. Your labor income depends on how many hours you have to work and the wage rate an
               employer will pay you for those hours.

               At the same time, some people own real estate, which they can either use themselves or rent
               out to other users. Some people have financial assets like bank accounts, stocks and bonds, for
               which they earn interest, dividends or some other form of income.




                                                            171]]></page><page Index="441"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY             Department of Management
                        Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus  BMGT21: Basic Microeconomics


               Each  of  these  factor  payments,  like  wages  for  labor  and  interest  for  financial  capital,  is
               determined in their respective factor markets. For the rest of this chapter, we will focus on labor
               markets, but other factor markets operate similarly.

               The Theory of Labor Markets
               By the end of this section, you will be able to know:
               • The Demand for Labor in Perfectly Competitive Output Markets
               • The Demand for Labor in Imperfectly Competitive Output Markets
               • What Determines the Going Market Wage Rate?

               What is the labor market?
               The labor market is the term that economists use for all the different markets for labor. There is
               no single labor market. Rather, there is a different market for every different type of labor. Labor
               differs  by  type  of  work  (e.g.  retail  sales  vs.  scientist),  skill  level  (entry  level  or  more
               experienced), and location (the market for  administrative assistants is probably more local  or
               regional than the market for university presidents). While each labor market is different, they all
               tend to operate in similar ways. For example, when wages go up in one labor market, they tend
               to go up in others too. When economists talk about the labor market, they are describing these
               similarities.

               The labor market, like all markets, has a demand and a supply. Why do firms demand labor?
               Why is an employer willing to pay you for your labor? It’s not because the employer likes you or
               is socially conscious. Rather, it’s because your labor is worth something to the employer--your
               work brings in revenues to the firm.

               If a firm wants to maximize profits, it will never pay more (in terms of wages and benefits) for a
               worker than the value of his or her marginal productivity to the firm. We call this the first rule of
               labor markets.

               Suppose a worker can produce two widgets per hour and the firm can sell each widget for $4
               each. Then the worker is generating $8 per hour in revenues to the firm, and a profit-maximizing
               employer will pay the worker up to, but no more than, $8 per hour, because that is what the
               worker is worth to the firm.

               Recall the definition of marginal product. Marginal product is the additional output a firm can
               produce by adding one more worker to the production process. Since employers often
               hire  labor  by  the  hour, we’ll  define  marginal  product  as  the  additional  output  the  firm
               produces by adding one more worker hour to the production process. In this chapter, we
               assume  that  workers  are  homogeneous—they  have  the  same  background,  experience  and
               skills  and  they  put  in  the  same  amount  of  effort.  Thus,  marginal  product  depends  on  the
               capital and technology with which workers have to work.

               A typist can type more pages per hour with an electric typewriter than a manual typewriter, and
               he or she can type even more pages per hour with a personal computer and word processing
               software. A ditch digger can dig more cubic feet of dirt in an hour with a backhoe than with at
               hovel.

               Thus, we can define the demand for labor as the marginal product of labor times the value of
               that output to the firm.

               Demand for Labor in Perfectly Competitive Output Markets
               The question for any firm is how much labor to hire. We can define a  Perfectly Competitive
               Labor Market as one where firms can hire all the labor they wish at the going market wage.
               Think about secretaries in a large city. Employers who need secretaries can probably hire as
               many as they need if they pay the going wage rate.

               Graphically,  this  means  that  firms  face  a  horizontal  supply  curve  for  labor,  as  Figure  14.3
               shows.

               Given the market wage, profit maximizing firms hire workers up  to the point where: Wmkt =
               VMPL

               Derived Demand
               Economists describe the demand for inputs like labor as a derived demand. Since the demand
               for labor is  MPL*P, it is dependent  on the demand for the product the firm is producing. We
               show this by the P term in the demand for labor. An increase in demand for the firm’s product
               drives up the product’s price, which increases the firm’s demand for labor. Thus, we derive the
               demand for labor from the demand for the firm’s output.

               Demand for Labor in Imperfectly Competitive Output Markets
               If the employer does not sell its output in a perfectly competitive industry, they face a downward
               sloping demand curve for  output, which means that in order to sell additional output the firm
               must lower its price. This is true if the  firm is a monopoly, but it’s also  true if the firm is an
               oligopoly  or  monopolistically  competitive.  In  this  situation,  the  value  of  a  worker’s  marginal
               product  is  the  marginal  revenue,  not  the  price.  Thus,  the  demand  for  labor  is  the  marginal
               product times the marginal revenue.

               The Demand for Labor = MPL x MR = Marginal Revenue Product

               Everything else remains the same as we described above in the discussion of the labor demand
               in perfectly competitive labor markets. Given the market wage, profit-maximizing firms will hire
               workers up to the point where the market wage equals the marginal revenue product, as Figure
               14.5 shows.




























               Do Profit Maximizing Employers Exploit Labor?
               If you look back at Figure 14.4, you will see that only the firm pays the last worker it hires what
               they’re worth to the firm. Every other worker brings in more revenue than the firm pays him or
               her. This has sometimes led to the claim that employers exploit workers because they do not
               pay workers what they are worth. Let’s think about this claim. The first worker is worth $x to the
               firm, and the second worker is worth $y, but why are they worth that much? It is because of the
               capital and technology with which they work. The difference between workers’ worth and their


                                                            176]]></page><page Index="446"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY             Department of Management

               compensation goes to pay for the capital, technology, without which the workers wouldn’t have
               a job. The difference also goes to the employer’s profit, without which the firm would close and
               workers wouldn’t have a job. The firm may be earning excessive profits, but that is a different
               topic.

               What Determines the Going Market Wage Rate?

               In the chapter on Labor and Financial Markets, we learned that the labor market has demand
               and  supply  curves  like  other  markets.  The  demand  for  labor  curve  is  a  downward  sloping
               function  of  the  wage  rate.  The  market  demand  for  labor  is  the  horizontal  sum  of  all  firms’
               demands for labor. The supply for labor curve is an upward sloping function of the wage rate.
               This  is  because  if  wages  for  a  particular  type  of  labor  increase  in  a  particular  labor  market,
               people with appropriate skills may change jobs, and vacancies will attract people from outside
               the geographic area.

               The market supply for labor is the horizontal summation of all individuals’ supplies of labor.























               Like all equilibrium prices, the market wage rate is determined through the interaction of supply
               and demand in the labor market. Thus, we can see in Figure 14.7 for competitive markets the
               wage rate and number of workers hired.

               The FRED database has a great deal of data on labor markets, starting at the wage rate and
               number of workers hired (https://openstax.org/l/cat10) .

               The  United  States  Census  Bureau  for  the  Bureau  of  Labor  Statistics  publishes  The  Current
               Population  Survey,  which  is  a  monthly  survey  of  households  (link  is  on  that  page),  which
               provides  data  on  labor  supply,  including  numerous  measures  of  the  labor  force  size
               (disaggregated by age, gender and educational attainment), labor force participation rates for
               different demographic groups, and employment. It also includes more than 3,500 measures of
               earnings by different demographic groups.

               The Current Employment Statistics, which is a survey of businesses, offers alternative estimates
               of employment across all sectors of the economy.

               Wages and Employment in an Imperfectly

               Competitive Labor Market
               By the end of this section, you will be able to:
               • Define monopsony power
               • Explain how imperfectly competitive labor markets determine wages and employment, where
               employers have market power

               In the Lesson on market structure, we observed that while economists use the theory of perfect
               competition  as  an  ideal  case  of  market  structure,  there  are  very  few  examples  of  perfectly
               competitive industries in the real world.

               What  about  labor  markets?  How  many  labor  markets  are  perfectly  competitive?  There  are
               probably  more  examples  of  perfectly  competitive  labor  markets  than  perfectly  competitive
               product markets, but that doesn’t mean that all labor markets are competitive.

               When a job applicant is bargaining with an employer for a position, the applicant is often at a
               disadvantage—needing the job more than the  employer needs that particular applicant. John
               Bates Clark (1847–1938), often named as the first great American economist, wrote in 1907: “In
               the making of the wages contract the individual laborer is  always at  a disadvantage. He has
               something which he is obliged to sell and which his employer is not obliged to take, since he
               [that is, the employer] can reject single men with impunity.”

               To give workers more power, the U.S. government has passed, in response to years of labor
               protests,  a  number  of  laws  to  create  a  more  equal  balance  of  power  between  workers  and
               employers. These laws include some of the following:

               • Setting minimum hourly wages
               • Setting maximum hours of work (at least before employers pay overtime rates)
               • Prohibiting child labor
               • Regulating health and safety conditions in the workplace
               • Preventing discrimination on the basis of race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, and age
               • Requiring employers to provide family leave
               • Requiring employers to give advance notice of layoffs
               • Covering workers with unemployment
               • Setting a limit on the number of immigrant workers from other countries

               Table 14.4 lists some prominent U.S. workplace protection laws. Many of the laws listed in the
               table were  only the  start  of labor market regulations in these  areas  and have been followed,
               over time, by other related laws, regulations, and court rulings.

               There  are  two  sources  of  imperfect  competition  in  labor  markets.  These  are  demand  side
               sources, that is, labor market power by employers, and supply side sources: labor market power
               by employees. In this section we will discuss the former. In the next section we will discuss the
               latter.

               A competitive labor market is one where there are many potential employers for a given type
               of worker, say  a secretary  or  an  accountant. Suppose there is  only  one employer in  a labor
               market.  Because  that  employer  has  no  direct  competition  in  hiring,  if  they  offer  lower
               wages than would exist in a competitive market, employees will have few options. If they
               want  a  job,  they must  accept  the  offered wage  rate. Since  the  employer  is  exploiting  its
               market power, we call the firm a monopsony. The classical example of monopsony is the sole
               coal company in a West Virginia town. If coal miners want to work, they must accept what the
               coal  company  is  paying.  This  is  not  the  only  example  of  monopsony.  Think  about  surgical
               nurses in a town with only one hospital. Employers that have at least some market power over
               potential employees is not that unusual. After all, most firms have many employees while there
               is only one employer. Thus, even if there is some competition for workers, it may not feel that
               way to potential employees unless they do their research and find the opposite.

               How does market power by an employer affect labor market outcomes? Intuitively, one might
               think that wages will be lower than in a competitive labor market. Let’s prove it. We will tell the
               story for a monopsonist, but the results will be qualitatively similar, although less extreme for
               any firm with labor market power.

               Think back to monopoly. The good news is that because the monopolist is the sole supplier in
               the market, it can charge any price it wishes. The bad news is that if it wants to sell a greater
               quantity of  output, it must lower the price it charges. Monopsony is  analogous. Because the
               monopsonist  is  the  sole  employer  in  a  labor  market,  it  can  offer  any  wage  that  it  wishes.
               However,  because  they  face  the  market  supply  curve  for  labor,  if  they  want  to  hire  more
               workers, they must raise the wage they pay. This creates a quandary, which we can understand
               by introducing a new concept: the marginal cost of labor. The marginal cost of labor is the cost
               to the firm of hiring one more worker.

               However, here is the thing: we assume that the firm is determining how many workers to hire in
               total. They are not hiring sequentially. Let’s look how this plays out with the example in  Table
               14.5.





                                                            180]]></page><page Index="450"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY             Department of Management
                        Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus  BMGT21: Basic Microeconomics














               There are a couple of things to notice from the table. First, the marginal cost increases faster
               than the wage rate. In fact, for any number of workers more than one, the marginal cost of labor
               is greater than the wage. This is because to hire  one more worker requires paying  a higher
               wage  rate,  not  just  for  the  new  worker  but  for  all  the  previous  hires  also. We  can  see  this
               graphically in Figure 14.7.





















































                                                            181]]></page><page Index="451"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY             Department of Management
                        Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus  BMGT21: Basic Microeconomics



               If the firm wants to maximize profits, it will hire labor up to the point Lm where DL = VMP (or
               MRP) = MCL., as Figure 14.9 shows. Then, the supply curve for labor shows the wage the firm
               will have to pay to attract Lm workers.

               Graphically, we can draw a vertical line up from Lm to the Supply Curve for label and then read
               the wage Wm off the vertical axis to the left.

               How  does  this  outcome  compare  to  what  would  occur  in  a  perfectly  competitive  market?  A
               competitive market would operate where DL = SL, hiring Lc workers and paying Wc wage. In
               other words, under monopsony employers hire fewer workers and pay a lower wage. While pure
               monopsony may be rare, many employers have some degree of market power in labor markets.
               The  outcomes  for  those  employers  will  be  qualitatively  similar  though  not  as  extreme  as
               monopsony.

               The Increasing Value of a College Degree
               The  cost  of  college  has  increased  dramatically  in  recent  decades,  causing  many  college
               students to take student loans to afford it. Despite this, the value of a college degree has never
               been higher. How can we explain this?

               We can estimate the value of a bachelor’s degree as the difference in lifetime earnings between
               the  average  holder  of  a  bachelor’s  degree  and  the  average  high  school  graduate.  This
               difference can be nearly $1 million.

               College  graduates  also  have  a  significantly  lower  unemployment  rate  than  those  with  lower
               educational attainments.

               While  a  college  degree  holder’s  wages  have  increased  somewhat,  the  major  reason  for  the
               increase  in  value  of  a  bachelor’s  degree  has  been  the  plummeting  value  of  a  high  school
               diploma. In the twenty-first century, the majority of jobs require at least some post-secondary
               education.  This  includes manufacturing  jobs  that  in  the  past  would  have  afforded  workers  a
               middle class income with only a high school diploma. Those jobs are increasingly scarce. This
               phenomenon  has  also  no  doubt  contributed  to  the  increasing  inequality  of  income  that  we
               observe in the U.S. today.

               KEY CONCEPTS AND SUMMARY

               The Theory of Labor Markets
               A  firm  demands  labor  because  of  the  value  of  the  labor’s  marginal  productivity.  For  a  firm
               operating in a perfectly competitive output market, this will be the value of the marginal product,
               which we define as the marginal product of labor multiplied by the firm’s output price. For a firm
               which  is  not  perfectly  competitive,  the  appropriate  concept  is  the  marginal  revenue  product,
               which we define as the marginal product of labor multiplied by the firm’s marginal revenue. Profit
               maximizing  firms  employ  labor  up  to  the  point  where  the  market  wage  is  equal  to  the  firm’s
               demand  for  labor.  In  a  competitive  labor  market,  we  determine  market  wage  through  the
               interaction between the market supply and market demand for labor.

               Wages and Employment in an Imperfectly Competitive Labor Market
               A monopsony  is  the  sole  employer  in  a  labor  market.  The monopsony  can  pay  any  wage  it
               chooses, subject to the market supply of labor. This means that if the monopsony offers too low
               a  wage,  they  may  not  find  enough  workers  willing  to  work  for  them.  Since  to  obtain  more
               workers, they must offer a higher wage, the marginal cost of additional labor is greater than the
               wage. To maximize profits, a monopsonist will hire workers up to the point where the marginal
               cost  of  labor  equals  their  labor  demand.  This  results  in  a  lower  level  of  employment  than  a
               competitive labor market would provide, but also a lower equilibrium wage.

               Market Power on the Supply Side of Labor Markets: Unions
               A  labor  union  is  an  organization  of  workers  that  negotiates  as  a  group  with  employers  over
               compensation  and  work  conditions.  Union  workers  in  the  United  States  are  paid  more  on
               average  than  other  workers  with  comparable  education  and  experience.  Thus,  either  union
               workers must be more productive to match this higher pay or the higher pay will lead employers
               to  find  ways  of  hiring  fewer  union  workers  than  they  otherwise  would.  American  union
               membership has been falling for decades. Some possible reasons include the shift of jobs to
               service  industries;  greater  competition  from  globalization;  the  passage  of  worker-friendly
               legislation; and U.S. laws that are less favorable to organizing unions.

               Bilateral Monopoly
               A bilateral monopoly is a labor market with a union on the supply side and a monopsony on the
               demand side. Since both sides have monopoly power, the equilibrium level of employment will
               be lower than that for a competitive labor market, but the equilibrium wage could be higher or
               lower depending  on which side negotiates better. The union favors  a higher wage, while the
               monopsony favors a lower wage, but the outcome is indeterminate in the model.

               Employment Discrimination
               Discrimination occurs in a labor market when employers pay workers with the same economic
               characteristics, such as education, experience, and skill, are paid different amounts because of
               race, gender, religion, age, or disability status.

               In  the  United  States,  female  workers  on  average  earn  less  than  male  workers,  and  black
               workers  on  average  earn  less  than  white  workers.  There  is  controversy  over  to  which
               discrimination  differences  in  factors  like  education  and  job  experience  can  explain  these
               earnings gaps. Free markets can allow discrimination to occur, but the threat of a loss of sales
               or a loss of productive workers can also create incentives for a firm not to discriminate. A range
               of public policies can be used to reduce earnings gaps between men and women or between
               white  and  other  racial/ethnic  groups:  requiring  equal  pay  for  equal  work,  and  attaining  more
               equal educational outcomes.

               Immigration
               The recent level of U.S. immigration is at a historically high level if we measure it in absolute
               numbers,  but  not  if  we  measure  it  as  a  share  of  population.  The  overall  gains  to  the  U.S.
               economy  from  immigration  are  real  but  relatively  small.  However,  immigration  also  causes
               effects like slightly lower wages for low-skill workers and budget problems for certain state and
               local governments.

               WEEK 16

               LESSON: THE FRONTIER OF MICROECONOMICS

               Learning Objectives:

               At the end of the lesson, you will be able to:
               1.  Explain the frontier of microeconomics
               2.  Discuss economics of asymmetric information
               3.  Discuss the meaning of Political Economy.
               4.  Discuss the meaning of Behavioral Economy.

               Overview:

               Economics is a study of the choices that people make and the resulting interactions they have
               with one another. This study has many facets, as we have seen in the preceding chapters. Yet it
               would be a mistake to think that all the facets we have seen make up a finished jewel, perfect
               and unchanging. Like all scientists, economists are always on the lookout for new areas to study
               and new phenomena to explain. This final chapter on microeconomics offers an assortment of
               three  topics  at  the  discipline’s  frontier  to  see  how  economists  are  trying  to  expand  their
               understanding of human behavior and society.

               The first topic is the economics of asymmetric information. Many times in life, some people
               are better informed than others, and this difference in information can affect the choices they
               make and how they deal with one  another. Thinking about this asymmetry can shed light on
               many aspects of the world, from the market for used cars to the custom of gift giving.

               The second topic we examine in this chapter is political economy. Throughout this book, we
               have seen many examples where markets fail and government policy can potentially improve
               matters. But “potentially” is  a needed qualifier: Whether this potential is  realized depends  on
               how  well  our  political  institutions  work.  The  field  of  political  economy  uses  the  tools  of
               economics to understand the functioning of government.

               The third topic in this chapter is behavioral economics. This field brings some of the insights
               from psychology into the study of economic issues. It offers a view of human behavior that is
               more subtle and complex than that found in conventional economic theory, but this view may
               also be more realistic.

               This chapter covers a lot of ground. To do so, it offers not a full helping of these three topics but,
               instead, a taste of each. One goal is to show a few of the directions economists are heading in
               their  effort  to  expand  knowledge  of  how  the  economy  works.  Another  goal  is  to  whet  your
               appetite for more courses in economics.

               Discussion


               The discipline’s frontier to see how economists are trying to expand their understanding of
               human behavior and society

               Economics of Asymmetric information



               Asymmetric information refers to a scenario or a condition where one person possesses more
               information than the other. Imbalance of information directly impacts on the decision of a buyer.
               This is a common tendency, which prevails in the market. The seller who is selling the product,
               logically holds more information about the product than the person he is trying to sell that to or
               the buyer. This exists even before the beginning of a transaction.

                     Pros and Cons:


               Healthy market economy is the outcome of asymmetrical information. It is natural for workers or
               producers wanting to excel in their chosen vertical or stream of job. They strive to obtain more
               knowledge on the product that they are dealing to ensure the best service and further manage
               trouble shooting too.  By being specialized, the seller tends to add more value to the product
               and in turn enhancing the market participation.

               On the other hand, the concept of asymmetric information forms a disparity in the transaction. It
               may force the producer to sell the product without disclosing some information that only he
               knows.

               Some of the drawbacks of asymmetric information are:

                     Adverse selection - is a problem that arises in markets in which the seller knows more
                       about the attributes of the good being sold than the buyer does. In such a situation, the
                       buyer runs the risk of being sold a good of low quality. That is, the “selection” of goods
                       sold may be “adverse” from the standpoint of the uninformed buyer.

               The classic example of adverse selection is the market for used cars. Sellers of used cars know
               their vehicles’ defects while buyers often do not. Because owners of the worst cars are more
               likely to sell them than are the owners of the best cars, buyers are apprehensive about getting a
               “lemon.” As a result, many people avoid buying vehicles in the used car market. This lemons
               problem can explain why a used car only a few weeks old sells for thousands of dollars less
               than a new car of the same type. A buyer of the used car might surmise that the seller is getting
               rid of the car quickly because the seller knows something about it that the buyer does not.

               A  second  example  of  adverse  selection  occurs  in  the  labor  market.  According  to  another
               efficiency-wage  theory,  workers  vary  in  their  abilities,  and  they  may  know  their  own  abilities
               better than do the firms that hire them. When a firm cuts the wage it pays, the more talented
               workers  are  more  likely  to  quit,  knowing  they  are  better  able  to  find  other  employment.
               Conversely,  a  firm may  choose  to  pay  an  above-equilibrium wage  to  attract  a  better  mix  of
               workers.
               A third example of adverse selection occurs in markets for insurance. For example, buyers of
               health insurance  know more  about their  own health problems than do insurance companies.
               Because people with greater hidden health problems are more likely to buy health insurance
               than are other people, the price of health insurance reflects the costs of a sicker-than-average



                                                            187]]></page><page Index="457"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY             Department of Management

               person. As a result, people in average health may be discouraged from buying health insurance
               by the high price.

               When  markets  suffer  from  adverse  selection,  the  invisible  hand  does  not  necessarily
               work its magic. In the used car market, owners of good cars may choose to keep them rather
               than  sell  them  at  the  low  price  that  skeptical  buyers  are  willing  to  pay.  In  the  labor  market,
               wages  may  be  stuck  above  the  level  that  balances  supply  and  demand,  resulting  in
               unemployment. In  insurance  markets,  buyers  with  low  risk may  choose  to  remain  uninsured
               because  the  policies  they  are  offered  fail  to  reflect  their  true  characteristics.  Advocates  of
               government-provided health insurance sometimes point to the problem of adverse selection as
               one reason not to trust the private market to provide the right amount of health insurance on its
               own.

                     Moral  Hazard  -  is  a  problem  that  arises  when  one  person,  called  the  agent,  is
                       performing some task on behalf of another person, called the principal. If the principal
                       cannot perfectly monitor the agent’s behavior, the agent tends to undertake less effort
                       than  the  principal  considers  desirable.  The  phrase  moral  hazard  refers  to  the  risk,  or
                       “hazard,”  of  inappropriate  or  otherwise  “immoral”  behavior  by  the  agent.  In  such  a
                       situation,  the  principal  tries  various  ways  to  encourage  the  agent  to  act  more
                       responsibly. The employment  relationship is the classic example. The employer is the
                       principal, and the worker is the  agent. The moral-hazard problem is the temptation  of
                       imperfectly monitored workers to shirk their responsibilities. Employers can respond to
                       this problem in various ways:

               • Better monitoring. Parents hiring nannies have been known to plant hidden video cameras in
               their homes to record the nanny’s behavior when the parents are  away. The  aim is to catch
               irresponsible behavior.
               • High wages. According to efficiency-wage theories, some employers may choose to pay their
               workers  a wage  above the level that  equilibrates supply  and demand in the labor market. A
               worker who earns an above-equilibrium wage is less likely to shirk because, if he is caught and
               fired, he might not be able to find another high-paying job
               • Delayed payment. Firms can delay part of a worker’s compensation, so if the worker is caught
               shirking and is fired, he suffers a larger penalty. One example of delayed compensation is the
               year-end bonus. Similarly, a firm may choose to pay its workers more later in their lives. Thus,
               the wage increases that workers get as they age may reflect not just the benefits of experience
               but also a response to moral hazard.

                     Monopoly of Knowledge

               Political Economy



               Political economy is an academic vertical to study the collaboration among individuals,
               governments, and public strategies. The connection between economic theories and its impact
               on economic systems such as socialism and communism are also analyzed here.

               This study has been further classified into two divisions:



                                                            188]]></page><page Index="458"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY             Department of Management
                        Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus  BMGT21: Basic Microeconomics


                     Classical political economy: concepts from traditional economists.
                     Modern political economy: concepts from modern economists.

               The study of political economy emphasizes on three prominent areas:


                     Interdisciplinary study:

               Inter disciplinary study refers to the connection among economic systems, political institutions,
               and the effects of environment contradicting to each other.


                     New political economy:

               New political economy emphasizes that economic principles are practical elements. They
               deserve or required to be further discussed and implemented. These principles are not
               restricted only for analysis.


                     International political economy:

               This can also be called as Global Political economy. The study of international political economy
               analyses the association between economics and international relations. It further highlights the
               path followed to shape political systems by analyzing how a state and institution use global
               economic interactions.

               Behavioral Economics


               Behavioral Economics deals with the combination of human behavior and economy. Behavioral
               Economics evolved to critically differentiate Rational Choice model. Rational Choice refers to
               an individual’s firm decision over his choice. In this case, individual knows what he wants to
               procure,  without  having  to  change  his  behavior  while  dealing  in  the  economy.  People  often
               choose a product, which offers maximum benefit compared to the options available. To do so,
               he has to think  on various  aspects such as the cost, make, model, comparison,  etc. Human
               Psychology is an unfathomable study, which reflects that today’s decision may not stand good
               for tomorrow or may be the next hour. Behavior  economics tries to trace these changes  and
               correlate with economic analysis.

               CONCLUSION
               This chapter has examined the frontier of microeconomics. You may have noticed that we have
               sketched out ideas rather than fully developing them. This is no accident. One reason is that
               you might study these topics in more detail in advanced courses. Another reason is that these
               topics remain active areas of research and, therefore, are still being fleshed out.

               To see how these topics fit into the broader picture, recall the Ten Principles of Economics from
               Chapter  1.  One  principle  states  that  markets  are  usually  a  good  way  to  organize  economic
               activity. Another principle states that governments can sometimes improve market outcomes.
               As you study economics, you can more fully appreciate the truth of these principles as well as
               the caveats that go with them. The study of asymmetric information should make you more wary
               of market outcomes. The study of political economy should make you more wary of government
               solutions. And the study of behavioral economics should make you wary of any institution that
               relies on human decision making, including both the market and the government.

               If  there  is  a  unifying  theme  to  these  topics,  it  is  that  life  is  messy.  Information  is  imperfect,
               government is imperfect, and people are imperfect. Of course, you knew this long before you
               started  studying  economics,  but  economists  need  to  understand  these  imperfections  as
               precisely as they can if they are to explain, and perhaps even improve, the world around them.

                      Chapter I:  Introduction to Production and
                                       Operations Management




               Instructional Objectives:


               After the completion of the lesson, students will be able to:

               1.  Define the scope of production and operation management

               2.  Discuss the evolution of production function.
               3.  Explain the manufacturing systems.

               4.  Identify the significance of operations management

             I. DEFINITION OF PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT


               Introduction:

               Production  and  Operation  Management  is  the  process  which  combines  and
               transforms  various  resources  used  in  the  production  /  operations  subsystem  of  the
               organization  into  value  added  product  /  services  in  a  controlled  manner  as  per  the
               policies of the organization.
               EVOLUTION OF PRODUCTION FUNCTION

               In  order  to  trace  the  evolution  of  production  function  we  identify  six  historical
               developments which includes the following:
               1. The Industrial Revolution
               2. Scientific Management
               3. The Human Relations Movement
               4. Operations Research
               5. Computer and Advanced Production Technology
               6. The Service Revolution

               OBJECTIVES OF PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT

               The objective of the production management is “to produce goods services of:

               1. RIGHT QUALITY






                                                              6]]></page><page Index="466"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY             Department of Management
                        Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus  BMGT25: Operations Management


               The quality of the product is established based upon customer’s needs. The right quality
               is  not  necessarily  best  quality.  It  is  determined  by  the  cost  of  the  product  and  the
               technical characteristics as suited to the specific requirements.
               2. RIGHT QUALITY

               The manufacturing organization should produce the products in right number. If they are
               produced in excess of demand the capital will block up in the form of inventory and if the
               quantity is produced in short of demand, leads to shortage of products.

               3. RIGHT TIME

               Timeliness od delivery is one of the important parameter to judge the effectiveness of
               production  management.  So,  the  production  department  has  to  make  the  optimal
               utilization of input resources to achieve its objective.


               4. RIGHT MANUFACTURING COST

               Manufacturing  costs  are  established  before  the  product  is  actually  manufactured.
               Hence, all attempts should be made to produce the products at pre-established cost, so
               as to reduce the variation between actual and the standard (pre-established) cost.

               into marketable goods. Usually employs a series of value – adding processes to convert
               raw materials into more useful forms, and eventually into finished products.

               LAYOUTS

               1. FACILITY LAYOUT
               Consists  of  configuring  the  plant  site  with  lines,  building,  major  facilities,  work  areas,
               aisles and other pertinent features such as department boundaries. Probably is one of
               the most crucial elements affecting efficiency.
               2. PROCESS LAYOUT
               Found primarily in job shops or firms that produce customized low volume products that
               may require  different  processing requirements  and sequences  of  operations.  Process
               Layout are facility configurations in which operations of a similar nature or function are
               grouped together.

               Advantages of Process Layout
               1. Flexibility
               2. Cost
               3. Motivation
               4. System Protection

               Disadvantages of Process Layout
               1. Utilization
               2. Cost
               3. Confusion

               3. PRODUCT LAYUT
               Product layout is found in flow shops (repetitive assembly and process or continuous
               flow industries. Flow shops produce high – volume, highly standardized products that
               require highly standardized, repetitive processes.

               2. Flexibility
               3. System Protection
               4. FIXED – POSITION LAYOUT
               A  Fixed  Position  layout  is  appropriate  for  a  product  that  is  too  large  or  too  heavy  to
               move,

               Disadvantages of Fixed Position Layout
               1. Space
               2. Administration

               5. COMBINATION LAYOUT
               Many  situations  call  for  a  mixture  of  the  three  main  layout  types  (which  includes  the
               process,  product  and  fixed  position  layout),  these  mixtures  are  commonly  called
               combinations or hybrid layouts.
               6. CELLULAR LAYOUT
               Cellular manufacturing is a type of layout where machines are grouped according to the
               process  requirements  for  a  set  of  similar  items  (part  families)  that  require  similar
               processing.

               7. OTHER LAYOUTS
               A. WAREHOUSE / STORAGE LAYOUT
               B. RETAIL LAYOUT
               C. OFFICE LAYOUT


               FACTORS OF PRODUCTION

               1. LAND
               This category sometimes extends over all natural resources. It is extended to represent
               the  contribution  to  production  of  nonhuman  resources  as  found  in  their  original,
               unimproved form.

               2. LABOR
               The  classical  “labor  theory  of  value”  was  an  innovative  theory  in  response  to  the
               physiocratic doctrine that only land could yield surplus.

               3. CAPITAL
               This is the most controversial of factors is variously defined as produces equipment as
               finance used to acquire produced equipment as all finance use to begin and carry on
               production including wage fund.
               4. ENTREPRENEURSHIP
               This function was assigned to the capitalist and frequently conflated with capital.

               THREE BROAD PURPOSES OF ECONOMIC RESOURCES
               1. MAINTENANCE
               2. DEFENSE
               3. PROGRESS
               The population must be supported an established consumption level; the existing stock
               of capital equipment must be MAINTAINED if there is not to be retrogression through
               depreciation and obsolescence; means must be provided for  DEFENSE against attack
               from abroad,
               If  the  PROGRESS  made  in  any  period  is  to  be  determined,  there  requirements  for
               maintenance must first be established.


               PRODUCTION SYSTEM MODEL


               PRODUCTION SYSTEM
               Production  System  are  the  methods  and  procedures  used  to  produce  goods  for  the
               market. Production systems utilize material, capital, transportation and labor resources
               to produce and distribute products.

               CLASSIFICATION OF PRODUCTION SYSTEM

               1. JOB SHOP PRODUCTION

               Job  shop  production  are  characterized  my  manufacturing  of  one  or  few  quantity  of
               products designed and produced as per the specification of customers within prefixed
               time and cost

               Characteristics of Job Shop Production
               The Job Shop Production system is followed when there is:
               1. High variety of products and low volume.
               2. Use of general purpose machine and facilities.
               3.  Highly  skilled  operators  who  can  take  up  each  job  as  a  challenge  because  of
               uniqueness.
               4. Large inventory of materials, tools, parts.
               5.  Detailed  planning  is  essential  for  sequencing  the  requirements  of  each  product,
               capacities for each work centre and order priorities,


                                                             11]]></page><page Index="471"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY             Department of Management

               2. BATCH PRODUCTION

               Batch Production is defined by the American Production and Inventory Control Society
               (APICS),  as  a  form  of  manufacturing  in  which  the  job  passes  through  the  functional
               departments  in  lots  or  batches  and  each  lot  may  have  a  different  routing.  It  is
               characterized  by  the  manufacture  of  limited  number  of  product  produced  at  regular
               intervals and stocked awaiting sales.
               Characteristics of Batch Production
               Batch production system is used under the following circumstances:
               1. When there is shorter production runs.
               2. When plant and machinery are flexible.
               3. When plant and machinery set up is used for the production of item in a batch and
               change of set up is required for processing the next batch.
               4.  When  manufacturing  lead  time  and  cost  are  lower  as  compared  to  job  order
               production.


               3. MASS PRODUCTION

               Manufactures  of  discrete  parts  of  assemblies  using  a  continuous  process  are  called
               mass production. This production system is justified by very large volume of production.
               The  machines  are  arrange  in  a  line  or  product  layout.  Product  and  process
               standardization exists and all outputs follow the same path.

               Characteristics of Mass Production
               Mass production is used under the following circumstances:
               1. Standardization of product and process sequence.
               2. Dedicated special purpose machines having higher production capacities and output
               rates.
               3. Large volume of products.
               4. Shorter cycle time of production.
               5. Lower in process inventory.
               6. Perfectly balanced production lines.
               7. Flow of materials, components and parts is continuous and without any back tracking.
               8. Production planning and control is easy.
               9. Material handling can be completely automatic.

               4. CONTINUOUS PRODUCTION
               Productions facilities are arranged as per the sequence of production operation form the
               first operations to the finished product. The items  are  made  through the sequence  of
               operations through material handling devices such as conveyors, transfer devices, etc.

               Characteristics of Continuous Production

                                                             12]]></page><page Index="472"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY             Department of Management
                        Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus  BMGT25: Operations Management


               Continuous production is used under the following circumstances.
               1. Dedicated plant and equipment with zero flexibility.
               2. Material handling is fully automated.
               3. Process follows a predetermined sequence of operations.
               4. Component materials cannot be readily identified with final product.
               5. Planning and scheduling is a routine action.

               STRATUM FORMULATION

               A production system normally consists with hierarchy of the organization and those are
               related  with  the  size  of  the  organization  and  the  function  of  the  organization.  And
               stratum normally related with the size, hierarchy and function of the organization.

               INCREASE OF ENTROPY

               Everything is changing in our life day by day. We need to cope with those changes. We
               will  change  the  old  employee  by  the  new  ones,  we  will  replaced  machines  by  new
               machine  and  we  will  change  the  technology  by  new  technology  for  stability  of  the
               production.

               ISOFINALITY

               We have an aim to reaching goals and to reach goals we will use various kind of way
               there is no boundary to make a function in such a way.

               SCOPE OF PRODUCTION MANAGEMENT

               PRODUCT

               Manufacturing  system  often  produces  standardized  products  in  large  volumes.  The
               plant  and machinery have  a finite capacity. The facilities constitute fixed costs,  which
               are allocated to the products produced.

               SERVICES

               Service system present more uncertainty with respect to capacity and cost. Services are
               produced and consumed in the presence of the customer.

               PROJECT

               Project  system  does  not  produce  standardized  products.  The  Plant,  Machinery,  Men
               and Materials are often brought to project site and the project is completed. The project
               is of big size and remains in the site itself after completion.

                 PRODUCTION SYSTEM DESIGN


               Product  designs  deals  with  conversion  of  ideas  into  a  reality.  Every  business
               organization  has  to  design,  develop  and  introduce  new  products  as  a  survival  and
               growth strategy. Developing the new products and launching them in the market is the
               biggest challenge faced by the organizations.

               PRODUCTION

               Production can be explained as an act of either manufacturing or mining or growing of
               goods (commodities) generally in bulk of trade. Production method employed for making
               or  providing  essential  goods  and  services  for  consumers.  It  is  a  process  that  puts
               intangible inputs like ideas, creativity, research, knowledge, wisdom, etc.

               SYSTEM

               System is an arrangement or assembly of inter dependent processes activities that are
               based on some logic and function. It operates as a whole and is designed (build) with
               an intension to achieve (fulfill) some objective or do some work.

               PRODUCTION SYSTEM

               Production  system  may  be  defined  as  production  system  utilizes  material  funds,
               infrastructure and labor to produce the required output in form of good.

               Production system consists of three main components, this are the:

               1. INPUTS

               Inputs  include  raw  materials,  machines,  man  hours,  components,  parts,  drawing,
               instruction and other paper works.

               2. CONVERSION PROCESS

               Conversion  process  includes  operations  (actual  production  process).  Operations  may
               be  either  manual  or  mechanical  or  chemical.  Conversion  process  also  includes
               supporting  activities  which  help  the  process  of  conversion.  The  supporting  activities
               include production planning and control purchase of raw materials, receipt, storage and
               issue  of  materials,  and  work  in  progress,  testing  of  products,  quality  control,
               warehousing of finished products and etc.

               3. OUTPUTS


                                                             14]]></page><page Index="474"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY             Department of Management

               Outputs includes finished products, finished goods (parts), and services.




               TANGIBLE GOODS.

               Consider an example of a manufacturing industry like a sugar industry. Here, sugarcane
               is  first  used  as  an  input,  and  then  the  juice  of  sugarcane  is  processed  through  a
               conversion process, finally to get  an output known as a refined sugar (used for mass
               consumption).

               INTANGIBLE GOODS.

               Consider  an  example  from  a  service  industry  that  of  a  software  development  firm  or
               company. Here, initially written program codes are used as an input. These codes are
               then  integrated  in  some  database  and  are  provided  with  a  user-  friendly  interface
               through  a  conversion  process.  Finally,  an  output  is  made  available  in  form  of  an
               executable application program.

                                             CAPACITY PLANNING

               Some basic questions in capacity planning are the following:

               1. What kind of capacity is needed?
               This question depends on the goods and services that management plans to produce or

               provide. Thus, capability planning is governed in a very real sense by those choices

               2. How much is needed?
               3. When is it needed?

               Forecast are key inputs used to answer the questions of how much is needed and when
               is it needed.

                       Manufacturing  system  management  strategy  takes  into  consideration  input
               requirements,  process  transfer,  and  production.  Corporations  conduct  capability

               preparation  by  considering  the  forecast  and  long-term  planning.  Capacity  is

               characterized as being able to obtain, store, or create. Capacity for an organization will

                                                             16]]></page><page Index="476"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY             Department of Management

               be  the  ability  of  a  given  system  to  achieve  output  within  the  specified  time  frame.

               Management  capacity  is  referred  to operations  as  an  amount  of  the  available  input
               resources for generating total production over time. Terms of capability are commonly

               referred  as  maximum  production  capacity  and  can  be  met  within  a  regular  period  of

               operation.
                       Capacity  planning  is  essential  in  order  to  evaluate  optimal  resource  utilization

               and  plays  a  crucial  role  in  decision-making  processes  such  as  expanding  existing

               activities, changing product lines, introducing new products, etc. A technique used for
               the  identification  and  evaluation  of  total  manufacturing  capacity  is  called  strategic

               capacity  planning. Strategic capacity planning is utilized for capital intensive resource
               like plant, machinery, labor, etc.

               Capacity Planning Strategies
               There are three primary strategies used to perform capacity planning. Each comes with

               its own set of advantages and disadvantages

                     Lead Strategy
                       It  is  the  most  aggressive  of  the  three  approaches  to  capacity  planning.

                       Company  is  increasing  its  manufacturing  capacity  ahead  of  expected  demand

                       increases.  Some  businesses  use  the  Lead  Strategy  as  a  means  to  convince
                       consumers away from competitors, especially when a competitor is vulnerable to

                       shortages when demand increases.
                     Lag Strategy

                       Lag Strategy responds to actual increases in demand by boosting capacity after
                       the operation is running at full steam. Time it takes to ramp up production can

                       result in the loss of customers to the competition.

                     Match Strategy
                       It is the middle road between the Lead and Lag Strategies. It emphasizes small,

                       incremental  modifications  to  capacity  based  on  changing  conditions  in  the

                       marketplace.  This  strategy  takes  Operations  Management  more  effort  and  is
                       harder to accomplish.

               Capacity planning is the first step in determining whether an organization will produce

               more or new products. For the following factors, Project managers are more concerned
               about the capability:

                     Sufficient capacity is required to meet the customers demand in time.

                     Sufficient capacity is required to meet the customers demand in time.

                     Capacity affects the cost efficiency of operations.
                     Capacity affects the scheduling system.

                     Capacity creation requires an investment.


               Measurement of Capacity Planning

                       Manufacturing capacity can be expressed in number of units of output per period.
               In some situations measuring capacity is more complicated. The relationship between

               capacity and output is below.

               1. Design capacity: A facility's designated capacity is the planned or engineered output
               rate of goods or services under normal or full-scale operating conditions. For instance

               the cement plant's designed capacity is 100 TPD (tonnes per day). The sugar factory
               has the capacity to crush 150 tons of sugar cane per day.

               2. Effective capacity: System capacity is the maximum output of the particular product
               or  product  mix  that  can  be  generated  as  an  integrated  whole  by  the  workers'  and

               machines  system.  Because  of  the  limitation  of  product  mix,  quality  specification,

               breakdowns,  device  performance  is  less  than  design  capability  or  at  the  most
               equivalent. The actual situation is even less so because of several factors that influence

               the  production  such  as  actual  demand,  downtime  due  to  machine/equipment  failure,
               unauthorized absenteeism.

               Determinants of Effective Capacity

                       Decisions about system design have an impact on capacity. The same is true for
               many operating decisions. This section briefly describes some of these factors:

               Forecasting Capacity Requirements
               Capacity planning decisions involve both long-term and short-term considerations.

                      Long-term capacity needs require forecasting demand over a time horizon and

                       then converting those forecasts into capacity requirements.
                      Short-term capacity needs are less concerned with cycles or trends than with

                       seasonal variations and other variations from average.
               Three very important factors in planning service capacity are:

                   1.  The need to be near customers

                   2.  The inability to store services
                   3.  The degree of volatility of demand

               The Challenges of Planning service capacity

                   1.  Convenience
                   2.  Capacity also must be matched with the timing of demand

                   3.  Demand volatility presents problems for capacity planners

                   4.  Demand management strategies


               MAKE OR BUY?
                       Once  capacity  requirements  have  been  determined,  the  company  needs  to

               decide whether to produce a product or offer a service on its own, or to outsource (buy)
               from another. For a number of purposes, many companies buy parts or communication

               services. Those factors include:

                   1.  Available Capacity
                   2.  Expertise

                   3.  Quality Considerations
                   4.  The nature of demands

                   5.  Cost
                   6.  Risk

               Developing Capacity Alternatives

                       Aside from the general considerations about the development of alternatives,
               there are other things that can be done to enhance capacity management:

                   1.  Design flexibility into systems

                   2.  Take stage of life cycle into accounts
                   3.  Take a “big-picture” approach to capacity changes

                   4.  Prepare to deal with capacity “chunks”
                   5.  Attempt to smooth out capacity requirements

                   6.  Identify the optimal operating level

                                                AGGREGATE PLANNING


                       Aggregate  planning  is  the  process  of  developing,  analyzing  and  maintaining  a
               preliminary,  approximate  timetable  for  an  organization's  overall  operations.  Generally
               speaking,  the  aggregate  plan  contains  targeted  sales  forecasts,  production  levels,
               inventory levels and backlogs for customers. This schedule is designed to meet demand
               forecast at a minimum cost


                       The  process  of  determining  product  group  production  levels  on  a  weekly  or
               monthly basis for the coming 6 to 18 months; the plan determines the average output
               level  in  support  of  the  business  plan.  Overall  planning  involves  converting  long-term
               expected  demand  into  real  output  rates  and  the  associated  intermediate-term  labor
               requirements.

               Aggregate Planning Process





















               Aggregate Planning Strategies


               The aggregate planner has two pure planning techniques to offer:





                                               Level
                                             Strategy               Chase
                                                                  Strategy









                                                             22]]></page><page Index="482"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY             Department of Management
                        Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus  BMGT25: Operations Management


                       Companies either choose to use one of the pure isolated strategies or choose a
               strategy that blends the two.

               Level Strategy


                       The level strategy aims at producing an aggregate plan which maintains a steady
               rate  of  production  and  a steady level  of  employment. To  meet changes  in consumer

               demand, the business must lift or lower inventory levels in expectation of increased or

               decreased expected demand levels.
                       When  demand  is  low,  the  company  retains  a  stable  workforce  and  a  steady

               production rate. This helps the firm to create higher levels of inventory than is currently
               necessary. As demand rises, the business should maintain a steady rate of production /

               stable level of employment, while allowing the inventory surplus to absorb the increased
               demand


               Chase Strategy

                       A chase strategy implies a corresponding cycle of demand and capability. This
               may result in a tremendous amount of employee recruiting, firing or laying off; insecure
               and  dissatisfied  employees;  increased  cost  of  carrying  inventories;  trade  union
               problems; and inconsistent plant and equipment usage.


                       It also implies greater flexibility on the part of the company. The biggest benefit of
               a chase strategy is that it allows inventory to be kept to the lowest possible level, and

               this is a significant savings for some businesses. Most companies which embrace the
















               concept of just-in-time production use a chase strategy approach to aggregate planning

               Aggregate Techniques


                      Linear Programming Model
                              Are approaches to achieve optimal solutions to problems involving limited

                       resource  allocation  in  terms  of  cost  minimization  or  benefit  maximization.  The
                       aim is to reduce the amount of costs associated with daily operating hours, over

                       time,  retaining  costs  of  inventories  and  costs  associated  with  increasing

                       workforce sizes. Constraints involve the capacities of the workforce, inventories
                       and subcontracting

                              E.H.  BOWMAN  – proposed formulating the  transport-type  programming
                       model  problem  as  a  means  of  obtaining  aggregate  plans  that  would  match

                       capacities  with  demand requirements  and  minimize costs. To  use this method,
                       planners need to define regular-time capability, subcontracting and inventory on

                       a period-by-period basis, as well as related costs for each variable

                      Linear Decision Rule
                              Another method for optimization is the theory of linear decision. Using a

                       series  of  cost-approximating  functions  (labor,  overtime,  hiring/lay  off,  inventory

                       carrying cost) to obtain a single quadratic equation it aims to reduce total cost of
                       output.  Then,  using  calculus,  two  linear  equations  can  be  derived  from  the

                       quadratic equation, one for the planning of the production for each cycle and the
                       other for the planning of the workforce.

                      Simulation

                              By developing an aggregate plan within a simulation model's setting it can
                       be  checked  to  identify  suitable  proposals  for  consideration  under  a  variety  of

                       conditions. These models can also be integrated into a decision-making support
                       framework that can help to prepare and analyze alternative control policies.

                              By  using  various  quantitative  measures  of  efficiency,  customer  service,

                       and flexibility, these models may incorporate the many competing goals involved
                       in manufacturing strategy.

                                                  FACILITY PLANNING

                      Facility Planning determines how an activity’s tangible fixed assets best support
               achieving the activity’s objectives.

                              For Examples:

                          a.  In manufacturing, the objective is to support production.
                          b.  In an airport, the objective is to support the passenger airplane interface.

                          c.  In a hospital, the objective is to provide medical care to patients.

               Facility
                       Facilities  can  be  generally  defined  as  buildings  where,  for  a  specific  reason,

               people, materials and machines come together-usually to create a tangible product or
               provide a service. The facility needs to be operated correctly to fulfill its stated aim and

               at the same time achieving multiple objectives.
                Such objectives include producing a product or producing a service:

                   A.  at lower cost,

                   B.  at higher quality,
                   C.  or using the least amount of resources

               Elements of Material Management

                   1.  Demand Estimation
                            Selection of items to be purchased need some basal document
                            Identify the needed items
                            Calculate from the trends in consumption pattern during the last 2-3 years
                       Forecasting  –  is  the  method  of  estimating  demand  based  on  time  series
                       analysis of past while anticipating the future

                   2.  Procurement - Process of acquiring supplies
                            Three sources:
                                 o  Purchase
                                 o  Donations
                                 o  Manufacturing
                            Objective of well procurement system:

                       ABC Analysis

                            ABC analysis is the analysis of the store items cost criteria
                            It  divides  inventory  into  3  categories,  A,  B  &  C  based  on  their  annual
                              consumption
                            ABC analysis has universal application for fields requiring selective control
                            It helps number of items, it rationalizes the number of orders, number of
                              items & reduce the inventory

                                   ABC  analysis does  not stress  on  items that those  are  less costly
                                     but may be vital
                   4.  Issue and Use

               B. Material Planning Requirement (MRP)

                           Definitions:


                    It  is  a  system  for  calculating  the  materials  and  components  needed  to
                      manufacture a product. It consists of three primary steps: taking inventory of the
                      materials and components on hand, identifying which additional ones are needed
                      and then scheduling their production or purchase.
                    Is  a  computer-based  inventory  management  system  designed  to  improve
                      productivity for businesses. Companies use MRP systems to estimate quantities
                      of raw materials and schedule their deliveries
                    MRP is designed to answer three questions: What is needed? When is needed?
                      How much is needed

                                                             37]]></page><page Index="497"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY             Department of Management
                        Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus  BMGT25: Operations Management


               Benefits  of MRP  – the  primary  objective  of MRP is to  make sure that materials  and
               components  are  available  when  needed  in  the  production  process  and  that
               manufacturing takes place on schedule. Additional benefits are:


                     Reduced customer lead time to improve satisfaction
                     Reduced inventory costs
                     Effective inventory management and optimization by acquiring or manufacturing
                       the  optimal  amount  and type  of  inventory, companies can  minimize the  risk  of
                       stock-outs,  and  their  negative  impact  on  customer  satisfaction,  sales  and
                       revenue, without spending more than necessary on inventory; and
                     improved  manufacturing  efficiency  by  using  accurate  production  planning  and
                       scheduling to optimize the use of labor and equipment.
               Disadvantages of MRP


                     Increased inventory costs: While MRP is designed to ensure adequate inventory
                       at the required times, companies can be tempted to hold more inventory than is
                       necessary,  thereby  driving  up  inventory  costs.  An  MRP  system  anticipates
                       shortages sooner, which can lead to overestimating inventory lot sizes and lead
                       times,  especially  in  the  early  days  of  deployment  before  users  gain  the
                       experience to know the actual amounts needed.
                     Lack of flexibility: MRP is also somewhat rigid and simplistic in how it accounts
                       for lead times or details that affect the master production schedule, such as the
                       efficiency of factory workers or issues that can delay delivery of materials.
                     Data  integrity  requirements:  MRP  is  highly  dependent  on  having  accurate
                       information about key inputs, especially demand, inventory and production. If one
                       or  two  inputs  are  inaccurate,  errors  can  be  magnified  at  later  stages.  Data
                       integrity  and  data  management  are  thus  essential  to  effective  use  of  MRP
                       systems.
               How MRP Works






                     MRP  works  backward  from  a  production  plan  for  finished  goods,  which  is
                       converted  into  a  list  of  requirements  for  the  subassemblies,  component  parts,
                       and  raw  materials  that  are  needed  to  produce  the  final  product  within  the
                       established schedule.
                     MRP uses information from the bill of materials (BOM), inventory data and the
                       master  production  schedule  to  calculate  the  required  materials  and  when  they
                       will be needed during the manufacturing process.

               C. Bill of Materials (BOM)


               Definitions:

                     A bill of materials (BOM) is a comprehensive inventory of the raw materials,
                       assemblies, subassemblies, parts and components, as well as the quantities of
                       each, needed to manufacture a product.
                     it is the complete list of all the items that are required to build a product. A BOM
                       is sometimes also referred to as a product structure, assembly component list or
                       production recipe (in process manufacturing industries).
                     Take, for example, a bicycle manufacturer that wants to build 1,000 bicycles. A
                       bill of materials for a bicycle will include all the parts that make up the bicycle
                       such as seats, frames, brakes, handlebars, wheels, tires, chains, pedals and
                       cranksets, including the quantities required of each component and their cost
                   A well-defined BOM helps companies:


                       o  Plan purchases of raw materials
                       o  Estimate material costs
                       o  Gain inventory control
                       o  Track and plan material requirements
                       o  Maintain accurate records
                       o  Ensure supply robustness and reduce waste

               BOM Structure - Typically, a BOM is hierarchical in nature, with the finished product at
               the top. It includes product codes, part descriptions, quantities, costs and additional
               specifications.

                   1.  Single-level bill of materials - which is a relatively simple list for a product. In
                       this type, each assembly or subassembly is shown only once, with the
                       corresponding quantity required of each to make the product. Though easy to
                       develop, this type of BOM is unsuitable for complex products because it does not
                       specify the relationship between parent and child parts or between assemblies
                       and subassemblies. If the product fails, a single-level BOM makes it difficult to
                       determine which part needs to be replaced or repaired.




























                   2.  Multilevel bill of materials - which takes more work to create but offers greater
                       details and specificity on the parent and child parts in the product. In a multilevel
                       BOM, the total material required is shown. Additionally, the product structure is
                       indented to show the relationship between the parent and child product, as well
                       as assemblies and subassemblies.

                              subassemblies  required  to  make  a  manufactured,  shippable  finished
                              product. An MBOM, in addition to the information on individual parts, also
                              includes information on the parts that require processing prior to assembly
                              and explains how various components relate to one another in a product.
                   2.  Engineering bill of materials
                          o  An engineering BOM (EBOM) defines assemblies or parts as designed by
                              the engineering department. Showing the component structure from a
                              functional perspective, an EBOM, for example, will consist of a mechanical
                              or technical drawing of a product. An EBOM is typically developed by
                              engineers using computer-aided design (CAD) or electronic design
                              automation (EDA) tools, and it is common to have more than one EBOM
                              for a product as the design undergoes a series of revisions.

                          o  A sales BOM (SBOM) defines a product in the sales stage, meaning
                              details of the product prior to assembly. In an SBOM, the list of finished
                              products and the components required to develop it appear separately in
                              the sales order document. Here, the finished product is managed as a
                              sales item instead of an inventory item.
               Conclusion:

                     A BOM serves as the foundation of production planning systems, and the
                       information in it provides the basic data for other business processes, such as
                       manufacturing resource planning, product costing, material provision for
                       production and plant maintenance.
                     Since the BOM combines all possible information that goes into building a final
                       product, it finds wide use in departments beyond manufacturing, such as
                       engineering, design, sales, material management and plant management.
               D. Ergonomics

                     Derived from Greek words ‘ergo’ meaning ‘work’ and ‘nomos’ meaning ‘laws’ –
                       “laws of work”
                     Scientific study of human work
                     “Designing the job to fit worker, not forcing the worker to fit the job”
                     Science that deals with designing and arranging things so that people can use
                       them easily and safely
                     Ergonomics is the scientific discipline concerned with the understanding of
                       interactions among humans and other elements of a system, and the profession
                       that applies theory, principles, data and methods to design in order to optimize
                       human well-being and overall system performance.
               Objectives

                     To improve the relationship between people, equipment, workplace, and the
                       environment
                     Increase work efficiency and productivity
                     Promote safety and comfort at work station
                     To reduce physical work loads
                     To minimize risk of injury, illness, accidents and errors without compromising
                       productivity

                     Physical ergonomics – is the human body’s responses to physical and
                       physiological workloads. Repetitive strain injuries from repetition, vibration, force
                       and posture fall into this category
                     Cognitive ergonomics – deals with the mental processes and capacities of
                       humans when at work. Metal strain from workload, decision making, human
                       error, and training fall into this category
                     Organizational ergonomics – deals with the organizational structures, policies
                       and processes in the work environment, such as shift work, scheduling, job
                       satisfaction, motivation supervision, teamwork, telecommuting, and ethics.
               Job Risk Factors

                     Working in awkward postures/positions
                     Prolonged sitting or standing
                     Bending, reaching, stretching
                     Driving for extended periods of time
                     Heavy lifting, awkward lifting, lifting in combination with twisting
                     Pushing, pulling, carrying
                     Slip/trip/fall accidents

                     Vibration and noise
                     Repetition
                     Contact stress
                     Thermal condition
               Two Classifications of Ergonomic Injuries


                   1.  Cumulative Trauma Disorders (CTD’s) – exposure driven
                         injury to soft tissue caused by prolonged exposure to multiple ergonomic risk
                          factors
                         typically develop in small body segments. (ex. Finger, wrist, elbows etc.)
                          Examples:
                          Tendon disorders:
                                inflammation of tendon or tendon sheathing caused by repeated
                                 rubbing against ligaments, bone, etc.
                                lateral epicondylitis (tennis elbow)
                          Nerve disorders:
                                compression of nerves from repeated or sustained exposure to sharp
                                 edges, bones, ligaments and or tendons
                                carpal tunnel syndrome

                          objects in awkward position
                         Common to large body segments
                         Risk of injury increases with the presence of multiple risk factors
               Tips to prevent injuries

                     warm up and stretch before activities that are repetitive, static or prolonged
                     take frequent breaks from any sustained posture every 20-30 minutes
                     recognize pain – positions or stop painful activity
                     beware of early signs of inflammatory process

                     be aware of surroundings or workstation environment
                     have a good posture in sitting or standing
                     avoid bending your neck forward for prolonged periods of time
                     alternate activities frequently: rotate heavy or repetitive tasks with lighter or less
                       repetitive ones

                             Inventory Management and Control

                       He who has a why to live can bear almost any how.” – Friedrich Nietzsche

               By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

                       1.  Define the requirements for effective inventory management.
                       2.  Discuss the importance of inventory management system.
                       3.  Identify the purpose of inventories.

                             CONCEPT OF INVENTORY MANAGEMENT AND CONTROL

                       Inventories  take  the  most  strategic  position  in  the  working  capital  structure  of
               most  business  enterprises.  It  making up the largest portion  of current  assets in  most

               business enterprises. In the field of working capital, effective inventory management has
               moved the most important issue on to the cement mills, where about two-thirds of the

               inventory  Established  factory  reserves  are  blocked  in  inventories.  Stock  turnover  is
               primarily driven by the depreciation of working capital. Therefore, it is very common that

               inventory which helps optimize profit should occupy the most important position among

               current assets.

               Meaning and Definition of Inventory
                      In the dictionary definition of inventory is a "detailed list of goods, furniture, etc."

               Some interpret the term inventory as a collection of products, but only the collection of

               finished items is the commonly accepted definition of the term 'goods' in the accounting
               language. However, in a production company there will be supply of partially completed

               products, raw materials  and  warehouses, in  addition  to the supply  of finished  goods.

               The collective name is 'inventory' for all these items.
                      The  inventory  requires  a  collection  of  certain  observable  products  personal

               property which:
                     Are held for sale in ordinary course of business.

                     Are in process of production for such sales.

                     They are to be currently consumed in the production of goods or services to be

                       available for sale.


               Objectives of Inventory Management

               The primary objectives of inventory management are:
                     To minimize the possibility of disruption in the production schedule of a firm for

                       want of raw material, stock and spares.

                     To keep down capital investment in inventories.
                   The major dangers of excessive inventories are:

                     The unnecessary tie up of the firm’s funds and loss of profit.
                     Excessive carrying cost, and

                     The risk of liquidity.
               The effective inventory management should

                     Maintain  sufficient  stock  of  raw  material  in  the  period  of  short  supply  and

                       anticipate price changes.
                     Ensure  a  continuous  supply  of  material  to  production  department  facilitating

                       uninterrupted production.
                     Minimize the carrying cost and time.

                     Maintain sufficient stock of finished goods for smooth sales operations.
                     Ensure that materials are available for use in production and production services

                       as and when required.

                     Ensure that finished goods are available for delivery to customers to fulfil orders,
                       smooth sales operation and efficient customer service.

                     Minimize investment in inventories and minimize the carrying cost and time.

                     Protect the inventory against deterioration, obsolescence and unauthorized use.
                     Maintain sufficient stock of raw material in period of short supply and anticipate

                       price changes.
                     Control investment in inventories and keep it at an optimum level.

               Problems faced by management:
                     To maintain a large size inventories for efficient and smooth production and sales

                       operation.

                     To maintain only a minimum possible inventory because of inventory holding cost
                       and opportunity cost of funds invested in inventory.

                     Control investment in inventories and keep it at the optimum level.

               Inventory Control
                     Inventory control is the technique of maintaining the size of the inventory at some

               desired level keeping in view the best economic interest of an organization.


























               Objective of Inventory Control

                            Protection against fluctuations in demand;

                            Better use of men, machines and material;
                            Protection against fluctuations in output;

                            Select  top  10  percent  of  all  items  which  have  high  rupee  percentage

                              classify the as “A”

               It may also be clear with the help of the following
                         Examples:

               “A” Category – 5% to 10% of the items represent 70% to 75% of the money value.
               “B” Category – 15% to 20% of the items represent 15% to 20% of the money.

               “C” Category – The remaining number of the items represent 5% to 10% of the money
               value


                   The relative position of these items show that items of category A should be under
               the  maximum control, items  of category B  may  not be given  that  much  attention  and

               item C may be under a loose control.

                              After  classification,  the  items  are  ranked  by  their  value  and  then  the
                       cumulative percentage of total value against the percentage of item are noted. A

                       detailed analysis of inventory may indicate above figure that only 10 per cent of

                       item may account for 75 per cent of the value, another 10 per cent of item may
                       account  for  15  per  cent  of  the  value  and  remaining  percentage  items  may

                       account for 10 per cent of the value. The importance of this tool lies in the fact
                       that it directs attention to the key items.

                                                 WORK MEASUREMENT

                       Work measurement is the application of techniques designed to establish the
               time for a qualified worker to carry out specified jobs at a defined level of

               performance.


               We have seen how total time to manufacture a product is increased by:

                     Adding undesirable features to product,
                     Bad operation of the processes, and

                     Ineffective time added because of worker and management.

               All this leads to decreased productivity.



                                                             53]]></page><page Index="513"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY             Department of Management

                       Work  measurement  is  about  investigating,  reducing  and  eliminating  inefficient

               time, whatever the cause may be. Work measurement is the means by which the time
               taken in the performance of an operation or series of operations is measured in such a

               way that the ineffective time is shown and separated. In practice the most difficult task is

               to  prove  the  existence  of  the  ineffective  time.  After  existence  is  proved,  nature  and
               extent is easy to see.

                       Work measurement is also used to set standard times for performing the work,

               so  any ineffective time  is not later included. Any  addition  to the standard time  would
               appear  as  an  excess time,  and can therefore be  brought to  attention. Since standard

               times  are  set  by  work  measurement  for  all  operations,  it  has  gained  bad  reputation
               amongst  the  staff.  The  primary  explanation  for  this  was  the  initial  emphasis  of  the

               methods of work measurement, which effectively addressed only the ineffective times
               controllable  by  the  worker. Traditionally,  management controllable inadequate  periods

               were overlooked.


               Purpose of Work Measurement

                     To reveal the nature and extent of ineffective time, from whatever cause,
                     So that action can be taken to eliminate it; and then,

                     To  set  standards  of  performance  that  are  attainable  only  if  all  avoidable
                       ineffective time is eliminated and work is performed by the best method available



               Uses of Work Measurement
                     To compare the efficiency of alternative methods. Other conditions being equal,

                       the method which takes the least time will be the best method.

                     To  balance  the  work  of  members  of  teams,  in  association  with  the  multiple
                       activity  charts,  so  that,  as  far  as  possible,  each  member  has  tasks  taking  an

                       equal time. To
                     Determine,  in  association  with  man  and  machine  multiple  activity  charts,  the

                       number of machines a worker can run.

               Uses of time standard

                     To provide information on which the planning and scheduling of  production can
                       be based, including the plant and labor requirements for carrying out the program
                       of work and utilization of resources. To provide information on which estimates
                       for tenders, selling prices and delivery promises can be based.
                     To set standards of machine utilization and labor performance which can be used
                       for incentive scheme.
                     To provide information for labor-cost control and to enable standard costs to be
                       fixed and maintained.

               Historical Data Method

                       Historical data system utilizes data from past results. Here past performance is
               used as a framework for determining expectations of work efficiency. This approach has

               the key benefit of being easy to understand, faster to estimate and simpler to execute.

               Past  success,  though,  isn't  the  best  basis  to  set  performance  expectations.  This  is
               because technology will change a great deal, employees’ behavior, abilities, etc.


               Time Study

                       The most widely used work measurement tool is time analysis with the aid of a

               stop watch. Frederick Winslow Taylor (1856-1915) invented this technique. Studying
               time is better suited for routine short-cycle work. A time-study will conveniently schedule

               most of the production work. The method for the time analysis consists of the following

               steps:
                            Pick the job to be timed.

                            Standardize the way work is performed.

                            Pick the worker you want to study.
                            Gather the necessary job descriptions and

                            Working conditions.
                       Dividing the work into parts. 'Element' is a part of the work here. Find out the time

               it took for each feature to do so. Keep relaxation rules, etc. Set the normal time to do
               the work.


                                                     Work Sampling

                       Work sampling method was originally developed in Britain in 1934 by Leonard

               Henry Caleb Tippett (1902-1985). The workers are observed several times at random in
               this technique. It's done to figure out how long the worker really is on the job for. It tests

               how long he works, and how long he doesn't work (idle time). The sampling method of
               work does not require calculation of the stop watch.

                       Job sampling technique is intended to determine which proportion of a worker's
               time is devoted to work-related activities. Work sampling method includes three key

               steps:

                            To decide which activities are classified as ‘working’
                            Non-working tasks are those that are not specified to function.

                            At selected intervals track the worker and record (write down) whether or
                              not he is working.

                       Calculate the portion of time (P), a worker is working. A portion of time (P) a

               worker is working equals to ’Number of observations during which working occurred’


                                                             56]]></page><page Index="516"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY             Department of Management

               divided by ’Total Number of observations.’ The above calculation is used as a

               performance standard


               Synthesis Method

                       In synthesis method, the full job  is first divided into  elements (parts). Then the

               time taken to do each element of the job is found out and synthesized (totaled). This

               gives the total time taken for doing the full job. In this technique, the time taken to do
               each element of the job is found out from previous time studies. So, this technique gives

               importance to past-time studies  of similar  jobs. It  also uses standard data. Standard-
               data is the normal time taken for doing routine jobs. Standard data is easily available for

               routine-jobs  like  fitting  screws,  drilling  holes,  etc.  So  there  is  no  need  of  calculating

               these times repeatedly.  Most companies use Standard-data. They  do  not  waste time
               doing  studies  for  all  elements  of  the  job.  This  is  because  standard  time  is  already

               available for most elements of a job.
                       For  example,  a  job  of  publishing  a  book  contains  four  elements  viz;  typing,

               editing, printing and binding. The time taken for doing each element is first found out.

               Suppose,  typing  takes  40  days,  editing  takes  30  days;  printing  takes  20  days  and
               binding takes 10 days. Then the time taken to do all the elements are totaled. That is, it

               takes 40 + 30 + 20 + 10 = 100 days to publish a book. This information is taken from
               previous  time  studies  of  other  printing  jobs  or  from  the  standard  data.  Synthesis

               technique also considers the level of performance. Level of performance refers to the
               speed  of  performance,  which  is  either,  normal,  fast,  or  very-fast.  The  benefits  or

               advantages of synthesis method: It provides reliable information about standard time for

               doing  different  jobs.  This  is  because  it  is  based  on  many  past  time  studies.  It  is
               economical because there is no need to conduct new time studies.

                       Predetermined  motion  time  system  In  ’Predetermined  Motion  Time  System’

               method or simply PMTS technique, the normal times are fixed for basic human motions.
               These  time  values  are  used  to  fix  the  time  required  for  doing  a  job.  Normally,  three

               times are fixed for one job. That is, one time is fixed for each level of performance. The

               level  of  performance  may  be  normal,  fast  and  very-fast.  PTMS  is  better  than  motion
               studies because it  gives the  detailed  analysis  of the  motion,  and it fixes the standard

               time for doing that motion. PTMS technique is used mostly for jobs, which are planned

               for future. However, it can also be used for current jobs as an alternative to time study.
               The  benefits  or  advantages  of PMTS method: It  is  a  very  accurate method.  It  avoids

               subjective  judgement  or  bias  of  rater.  It  is  an  effective  and  economical  method  for
               repetitive jobs of short duration. There is no interference in the normal work routine, and

               so it does  not face  any  resistance from the  employees. It  helps to improve  the  work
               methods because it gives a detailed analysis of the motions. It is more economical and

               fast compared to normal time studies.


               Analytical estimating

                        Analytical estimating method or technique is used for fixing the standard time for
               jobs, which are very long and repetitive. The standard-time is fixed by using standard-

               data. However, if standard data is not available, then the standard time is fixed based
               on the experience of the work-study engineer.

               Standard time

                       Standard time is the time allowed to an operator to carry out the specified task

               under specified conditions and defined level of performance. Standard time may be
               defined as the, amount of time required to complete a unit of work:

               (a) under existing working conditions, (b) using the specified method and machinery, (c)

               by an operator, able to the work in a proper manner, and (d) at a standard pace. Thus
               basic constituents of standard time are:

               1. Elemental (observed time).
               2. Performance rating to compensate for difference in pace of working.(PRF)

               3. Relaxation allowance.
               4. Interference and contingency allowance.

               5. Policy allowance.


               Components of Standard Time

               • OT – Observed Time

               • PRF – Performance Rating Factor

               • NT – Normal Time • PA – Process Allowances


               • RPA – Rest and Personal Allowances (Relaxation Allowance)

               • SA – Special Allowances (Interference and Contingency Allowances)

               • PoA – Policy Allowances

               • PFD – Personal, Fatigue and Delay Allowances = (PA+RPA+SA)


               The Standard Time is the product of three factors:


                                                             59]]></page><page Index="519"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY             Department of Management
                        Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus  BMGT25: Operations Management


               1. Observed time: The time measured to complete the task.


               2. Performance rating factor: The pace the person is working at. 90% is working slower
               than normal, 110% is working faster than normal, 100% is normal. This factor is
               calculated by an experienced worker who is trained to observe and determine the
               rating.


               3. Personal, fatigue, and delay (PFD) allowance.

               The standard time can then be calculated by using the formula:

               Standard Time = (Observed Time) (Rating Factor)(1+PFD Allowance)


               ILLUSTRATION 1:

               Assuming that the total observed time for an operation of  Assembling an electric switch
               is 1.00 min. If the rating is 120%, find normal time. If an allowance of 10% is allowed for
               the operation, determine the standard time.

               SOLUTION:

               Observed time (or) selected time = 1.00 min

               Rating = 120%
               Allowance = 10%
               As we know that, normal time = Observed time × Rating % ÷ 100 = 1.00 ×120
               ÷10=1.20min Allowance @ 10% = 1.20 ×10 ÷ 100 = 0.12 min
               Standard time = Normal time + Allowances • = 1.20 + 0.12 = 1.32 min.


                                                    WORK SAMPLING

                       Work  sampling  is  a  method  of  finding  the  percentage  occurrence  of  a  certain

               activity by statistical sampling and random observations. Work sampling is the process
               of  making  sufficient  random  observations  of  an  operator’s  activities  to  determine  the

               relative amount of time the operator spends on the various activities associated with the
               job.


               The major goal of work sampling is to determine how long, or how much of the
               work day, is spent on specific types of work.

                     Work sampling may identify the fact that certain operators spend a large portion

                       of their time waiting for work, or performing paperwork tasks, or even performing
                       activities that are not included in their job descriptions.

                     One of the basic foundations of statistical sampling theory is the concept that the

                       larger the sample size, the results will be more accurate.
                     In work sampling, a sufficient number of observations must be made to be sure

                       that the results accurately summarize the work performed. There are statistical

                       formulas to help determine how many observations should be made.
               CONDUCTING A STUDY

                       It  is  recommended  that  a  uniform  procedure  should  be  followed  to  perform  a
               work sampling study is to:

               1.   Establish the Purpose
                       First,  the  objective  of  the  study  should  be  established.  Work  sampling  can  be

               used to determine an overall perspective on the work done.

               2.   Identify the Subjects
                       Second,  the  people  performing  the  task  must  be  identified,  i.e.  general  office

               work is being studied with the objective of determining overall productivity.
               3.   Identify the Measure of Output

                       The  third  step  in  making  the  study  is  the  identification  of  the  measure  of  the
               output produced or the types of activities performed on the jobs being studied. This step

               is especially important if the objective of the study is to measure productivity with the

               intent of setting a standard.
               4.   Establish a Time Period

                       Fourth,  the  time  period  during  which  the  study  will  be  conducted  must  be

               established. Starting and stopping points for the study must be defined as well.
               5.   Define the Activities

                       This step involves defining the activities that are performed by the people under
               study. For example, the definition used in a machine utilization study, including only the

               categories of working, idle, and idle-mechanical breakdown.

               6.   Determine the Number of Observations Needed

                       After the work elements are defined, the number of observations for the desired
               accuracy  at  the  desired  confidence  level  must  be  determined.  If  a  reasonable  guess

               cannot be made, then a trial study of perhaps 20 to 40 observations should be made to

               get an estimate.


               7.   Schedule the Observations

                       Once  the  number  of  required  observations  has  been  determined,  either  from
               appropriate statistical calculations or from tables, and the actual observations must be

               scheduled. Typically, the analyst will assign an equal number of observations each day
               during the course of the study. For example, if 800 observations are required and 20

               work days are established as an appropriate observation time, 40 observations should
               be recorded  each day. A random  number table can be used to  establish the random

               times for each observation.

               8.   Inform the Personnel Involved
                       Before  the  study  is  actually  performed,  the  personnel  involved  should  be

               informed about the objective of the study and the methodology that will be employed.
               9.   Record the Raw Data

                       The next is the actual recording of the raw data. Although this recording can be
               performed by anyone, it is desirable that a trained analyst be employed.  It is also very

               important that the observations be made at exactly the same location every time.

               10.  Summarize the Data
               After the data have been collected, they must be summarized.



               Establishing confidence levels
                       Let us go back to our previous example and toss five coins at a time, and then

               record the number of times we have heads and the number of times we have tails for
               each toss of these five coins. Let us then repeat this operation 100 times.

               To make things easier, it is more convenient to speak of a 95 per cent confidence level
               than of a 95.45 per cent confidence level.

               To achieve this we can change our calculations and obtain:

                   95 per cent confidence level or 95 per cent of the area under the curve = 1.96 σp
                   99 per cent confidence level or 99 per cent of the area under the curve = 2.58 σp
                  99.9 per cent confidence level or 99.9 per cent of the area under the curve = 3.3 σp

               In this case we can say that if we take a large sample at random we can be confident
               that in 95 per cent of the cases our observations will fall within ± 1.96 σp

               Determination of sample size
                     As well as defining the confidence level for our observations we have to decide

                       on the margin of error that we can allow for these observations.

                     Let us look at our example about the productive time and the idle time of the
                       machines in a factory. There are two methods of determining the sample size

                       that would be appropriate for this example:
                     The statistical method and the nomogram method.

               Statistical method. The formula used in this method is:
















                     Let us assume that some 100 observations were carried out as a preliminary
                       study and at random, and that these showed the machine to be idle in 25 per

                       cent of the cases (p = 25) and to be working 75 per cent of the time (q = 75).
                     We thus have approximate values for p and q; in order now to determine the

                       value of n.
                     Let us choose a confidence level of 95 per cent with a 10 per cent margin of error

                       (that is, we are confident that in 95 per cent of the cases our estimates will be ±

                       10 per cent of the real value).

























                   Advantages of Work Sampling
                         Can be used to measure activities that are impractical to measure by direct

                          observation
                         Multiple subjects can be included

                         Requires less time and lower cost than continuous direct observation

                            Not as accurate for setting time standards as other work measurement

                              techniques

                            Usually not practical to study a single subject
                            Work sampling provides less detailed information about work elements

                              than DTS or PMTS
                            Since work sampling deals with multiple subjects, individual differences

                              will be missed
                            Workers may be suspicious because they do not understand the statistical

                              basis of work sampling

                             QUALITY ASSURANCE AND CONTROL


               At the end of this lesson the students will be able to:


                   1.  Define the types of quality control.
                   2.  Discuss the importance or benefits of quality control.
                   3.  Identify the advantages and disadvantages of quality control.
                   4.  Differentiate between quality control and quality assurance




























               A. Quality Assurance and Quality Control


               Quality
                    Quality is an important factor when it comes to any product or service. Therefore,
                      all  manufacturers  and service  providers  out there constantly look for  enhancing
                      their product or the service quality.
                    In order to maintain or enhance the quality of the offerings, manufacturers use two
                      techniques, quality assurance and quality control.
                         o  These two practices make sure that the end product or the service meets
                             the  quality  requirements  and  standards  defined  for  the  product  or  the
                             service.
               Are “Quality Assurance” and “Quality Control” same terms?

                       Big  no!  This  term  is  effectively  different.  Most  of  the  time,  we  use  both  terms
               randomly, hence to study and understand the difference between them is important.

               Link between QA and QC

                     QC detected a recurrent problem or defect with the quality of the products. QC
                       provides  feedback  to  QA  persons  that  there  is  a  problem  in  the  process  or
                       system that is causing product quality problems
                     QA determines the root cause  of  the  problem  and then  brings changes  to the
                       process to ensure that there are no quality issues in the future
               B. Statistical Process Control and Statistical Quality Control

                       The tension between after-the-fact inspection and defect prevention has been at
               the heart of manufacturing since the introduction of statistical methods to industry in the
               1940s. Today, to clearly divide responsibilities within an organization, and tie these very
               different activities to existing roles, consider a division by impact to the patient.

               The Difference Between SPC and SQC


                     Activities  which monitor  a  process in real-time to prevent defects while  a  lot is
                       being manufactured are known as Statistical Process Controls (SPC).
                     In  contrast,  activities  which  occur  after  manufacture  to  keep  defects  from
                       reaching a patient by additional inspection are Statistical Quality Control (SQC).
                     Both are necessary in an industry of low volume, high cost, high risk goods.
               Statistical Process Control (SPC)

                       Statistical  process  control  (SPC)  involves  inspecting  a  random  sample  of  the
               output from a process and deciding whether the process is producing products with the
               characteristics  that  fall  within  a  predetermined  range.  SPC  answers  the  question  of
               whether the process is functioning properly or not

               The Seven Old Tools

               1.  Control Chart
                   Control chart is a graph used to study how a process changes over time. Data are
               plotted in time order. A control chart always has a central line for the average, an upper
               line for the upper control limit and lower line for the lower control limit. These lines are
               determined from historical data. Example:

                                                             70]]></page><page Index="530"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY             Department of Management

               2.  Run Chart
                   A run chart is a line graph of data plotted over time. By collecting and charting data
                   over time, you can find trends or patterns in the process because they do not use
                   control limits. Run charts cannot tell you if a process is stable. Example:



























               3.  Pareto Chart
                   Pareto  chart  is  a  type  of  chart  the  contains  both  bars  and  line  graph,  where
               individual values are represented in descending order by bars and the cumulative total
               is represented by the line. Example:











                                                             71]]></page><page Index="531"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY             Department of Management

               4.  Flowchart
                   Flowchart is  a type  of diagram that represents  an  algorithm,  workflow  or process,
               showing the steps as boxes of various kinds, and their order by connecting them with
               arrows.  This  diagrammatic  representation  illustrates  a  solution  model  to  a  given
               problem.  Flow  charts  are  used  in  analyzing,  designing,  documenting  or  managing  a
               process or program in various fields. Example:





























               5.  Cause and Effect Diagram
               Cause  and Effect diagram is  a diagram  which  visually  displays the many cause for  a
               problem or effect. It helps to find the root cause of a problem. Example.

               6.  Histogram
                   A histogram is a graphical representation of the distribution of numerical data. It is
               an estimate of the probability distribution of a continuous variable. It is consisting of
               rectangle whose area is proportional to the frequency of a variable and whose width is
               equal to the class interval. Example:































               7.  Scatter Diagram
               Scatter diagram is a tool for analyzing relationships between two variables for
               determining how closely the two variables are related. One variable is plotted on the
               horizontal axis and the other is plotted on the vertical axis. Example:

               The Seven New Tools

               1.  Affinity diagram
                       An affinity diagram is a tool that gathers large amounts of language data (ideas,
               opinions,  issues)  and  organizes  them  into  groupings  based  on  their  natural
               relationships.  The  affinity  process  is  often  used  to  group  ideas  generated  by
               brainstorming. Example:































                                                             74]]></page><page Index="534"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY             Department of Management

               2.  Relationship Diagram
               An entity-relationship diagram is a graphical representation of an information system
               that shows the relationship between people, objects, places, concepts or even events
               within that system. This diagram is a data modeling technique that can help define
               business processes. Example:







































               3.  Tree Diagram
                   A  tree  diagram  is  a  new  management  planning  tool  that  depicts  the  hierarchy  of
               tasks and subtasks needed to complete and objective. The tree diagram starts with one
               item that branches into two or more, each of which branch into two or more, and so on.
               Example:

               4.  Matrix Diagram
               A matrix diagram is a tool that allows a team to identify the presence and strengths of
               relationships between two or more lists of items. It provides a compact way of
               representing many-to-may relationships of varying strengths.

               5.  Program Decision Process Chart
               The process decision program chart systematically identifies what might go wrong in a
               plan under development. Countermeasures are developed to prevent or offset those
               problems. By using this chart, you can either revise the plan to avoid the problems or be
               ready with the best response when a problem occurs






























               6.  Arrow Diagram
                   An arrow diagram is defined as a process diagramming tool used to determine
               optimal sequence of events, and their interconnectivity. It is used for scheduling and to
               determine the critical path through nodes.

               7.  Prioritization Matrix
               A prioritization matrix is a simple tool that provides a way to sort a diverse set of items
               into an order of importance. It also identifies their relative importance by deriving a
               numerical value for the priority of each item

































               Statistical Quality Control

                       Statistical quality control refers to the use of statistical methods in the monitoring
               and maintain of the quality of products and services. Sampling technique is the most
               widely used SQC tool.

               Sampling

                       Sampling is concerned with the selection of a subset of individuals from within a
               statistical population to estimate characteristics of the whole population. Each
               observation measures one or more properties (such as weight, location, colour) of
               observable bodies distinguished as independent objects or individuals.

               Probability Sampling – is a sample in which every unit in the population has a chance
               (greater  than  zero)  of  being  selected  in  the  sample,  and  his  probability  can  be
               accurately determined.

                   a)  Simple random sampling – in a simple random sample of given size, all such
                       subsets of the frame are given an equal probability. Furthermore, any given pair
                       of  elements  has  the  same  chance  of  selection  as  any  other  such  pair.  This
                       minimizes bias and simplifies analysis of results
                   b)  Systematic Sampling – also known as interval sampling, relies on arranging the
                       study  population  according  to  some  ordering  scheme  and  then  selecting
                       elements  at  regular  intervals  through  that  ordered  list.  Systematic  sampling
                       involves  a  random  start  and  then  proceeds  with  the  selection  of  every  kth
                       element from then onwards.
                   c)  Stratified sampling – Stratified sampling is a type of sampling method in which
                       the  total  population  is  divided  into  smaller  groups  or  strata  to  complete  the
                       sampling process. The strata is formed based on some common characteristics
                       in  the  population  data.  After  dividing  the  population  into  strata,  the  researcher
                       randomly selects the sample proportionally
                   d)  Cluster sampling - Cluster sampling is a probability sampling technique where
                       researchers  divide  the  population  into  multiple  groups  (clusters)  for  research.
                       Researchers  then  select  random  groups  with  a  simple  random  or  systematic
                       random sampling technique for data collection and data analysis.
               Non-probability Sampling  - Non-probability sampling is  any sampling method where
               some elements of the population have no chance of selection or where the probability of
               selection can't be accurately determined. It involves the selection of elements based on
               assumptions regarding the population of interest, which forms the criteria for selection.
               Hence, because the selection of elements is non-random.

                   a)  Quota  Sampling  -  Quota  sampling,  the  population  is  first  segmented  into
                       mutually exclusive sub-groups, just as in stratified sampling. Then judgement is
                       used  to  select  the  subjects  or  units  from  each  segment  based  on  a  specified
                       proportion.
                              In  quota  sampling  the  selection  of  the  sample  is  non-random.  For
                       example, interviewers might be tempted to interview those who look most helpful.
                       The problem is that these samples may be biased because not everyone gets a
                       chance  of  selection.  This  random  element  is  its  greatest  weakness  and  quota
                       versus probability has been a matter of controversy for several years.

                   b)  Convenience  sampling  -  Convenience  sampling  is  a  type  of  non-probability
                       sampling which involves the sample being drawn from that part of the population
                       which  is  close  to  hand.  That  is,  a  population  is  selected  because  it  is  readily
                       available and convenient.
                              For  example,  if  the  interviewer  were  to  conduct  such  a  survey  at  a
                       shopping  centre  early  in  the  morning  on  a  given  day,  the  people  that  he/she
                       could interview  would  be limited to those  given there  at that given time,  which
                       would not represent the views of other members of society in such an area, if the
                       survey  were  to  be  conducted  at  different  times  of  day  and  several  times  per
                       week.
                   c)  Purposive  sampling  -  Purposive  sampling  is  a  sampling  technique  in  which
                       researcher  relies  on  his  or  her  own  judgment  when  choosing  members  of
                       population to participate in the study.
                              TV reporters stopping certain individuals on the street in order to ask their
                       opinions about certain political changes constitutes the most popular example of
                       this sampling method. However, it is important to specify that the TV reporter has
                       to  apply  certain  judgment  when  deciding  who  to  stop  on  the  street  to  ask
                       questions; otherwise it would be the case of random sampling technique.
                   d)  Self-selection sampling - Self-selection sampling is appropriate when we want
                       to  allow units or cases,  whether individuals  or  organizations, to choose to take
                       part  in  research  on  their  own  accord.  The  key  component  is  that  research
                       subjects  (or  organization’s)  volunteer  to  take  part  in  the  research  rather  than
                       being approached by the researcher directly.
                   e)  Snowball  sampling  -  Snowball  sampling  (or  chain  sampling,  chain-referral
                       sampling,  referral  sampling)  is  a  non-probability  sampling  technique  where
                       existing study subjects recruit future subjects from  among their  acquaintances.
                       Thus  the  sample  group  is  said  to  grow  like  a  rolling  snowball.  As  the  sample
                       builds  up,  enough  data  are  gathered  to  be  useful  for  research.  This  sampling

                       technique is often used in hidden populations which are difficult for researchers
                       to access
               C. Risk Management

                       Risk management is the process of identifying, assessing and controlling threats
               to  an  organization's  capital  and  earnings.  These  threats,  or  risks,  could  stem  from  a
               wide  variety  of  sources,  including  financial  uncertainty,  legal  liabilities,  strategic
               management  errors,  accidents  and  natural  disasters.  IT  security  threats  and  data-
               related risks, and the risk management strategies to alleviate them, have become a top
               priority  for  digitized  companies.  As  a  result,  a  risk  management  plan  increasingly
               includes companies' processes for identifying and controlling threats to its digital assets,
               including  proprietary  corporate  data,  a  customer's  personally  identifiable  information
               (PII) and intellectual property.


                       Every  business  and  organization  faces  the  risk  of  unexpected,  harmful  events
               that can cost the company money or cause it to permanently close. Risk management
               allows organizations to attempt to prepare for the unexpected by minimizing risks and
               extra costs before they happen

               Important benefits of risk management include:

                     Creates a safe and secure work environment for all staff and customers.
                     Increases the stability of business operations while also decreasing legal liability.
                     Provides protection from events that are detrimental to both the company and the
                       environment.
                     Protects all involved people and assets from potential harm.
                     Helps  establish  the  organization's  insurance  needs  in  order  to  save  on
                       unnecessary premiums.


               Risk management strategies should also attempt to answer the following questions:

                    1.  What  can  go  wrong?  Consider  both  the  workplace  as  a  whole  and  individual
                       work
                    2.  How  will  it  affect  the  organization?  Consider  the  probability  of  the  event  and
                       whether it will have a large or small impact.
                    3.  What can be done? What steps can be taken to prevent the loss? What can be
                       done recover if a loss does occur?
                    4.  If something happens, how will the organization pay for it?

               D. Safety Management System


               Definitions

                     A  safety  management  system  (SMS)  is  a  systematic  approach  to  managing
                       safety,  including  the  necessary  organizational  structures,  accountabilities,
                       policies and procedures.
                     Safety Management System (SMS) - A systematic and explicit approach defining
                       the  activities by  which safety  management is undertaken by  an  organization in
                       order to achieve acceptable or tolerable safety.
               Objective

                              The objective of a Safety Management System is to provide a structured
               management  approach  to  control  safety  risks  in  operations.  Effective  safety
               management  must  take  into  account  the  organization’s  specific  structures  and
               processes related to safety of operations.

               Description

                       Use  of  SMS  can  be  generally  interpreted  as  applying  a  quality  management
               approach  to  control  safety  risks.  Similar  to  other  management  functions,  safety
               management requires planning, organizing, communicating and providing direction.


                       The  SMS  development  begins  with  setting  the  organizational  safety  policy.  It
               defines the generic principles upon which the SMS is built and operated. This first step
               outlines the strategy for achieving acceptable levels of safety within the organization.

                       Safety planning  and  the implementation  of safety management  procedures  are
               the next key steps in the processes designed to mitigate and contain risk in operations.
               Once  these  controls  are  ready,  quality  management  techniques  can  be  utilized  to
               ensure that they achieve the intended objectives and, where they fail, to improve them.
               This  is  accomplished  by  deployment  of  safety  assurance  and  evaluation  processes
               which in turn provide for a continuous monitoring of operations and for identifying areas
               of safety improvement.

                       Put  simply,  effective  safety  management  systems  use  risk  and  quality
               management methods to achieve their safety goals. In addition, SMS also provides the
               organizational  framework  to  establish  and  foster  the  development  of  a  positive
               corporate  safety  culture.  The  implementation  of  an  SMS  gives  the  organization’s

             I. DEFINITION OF SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENET














































               Introduction:

               Generally, supply chain managers work more externally than operations managers. In

               today’s global market, supply chain managers are expected to have an understanding
               of  working  with suppliers, logistics,  and customers  all  over the  world. They make key
               decisions on suppliers, coordinate purchasing, warehousing, and forecasting.


               Supply Chain manager duties may include:

                     Forecasting demand for materials or products

                     Creating supply plans to ensure availability of raw materials

                                                             85]]></page><page Index="545"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY             Department of Management
                        Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus  BMGT25: Operations Management


                     Evaluating suppliers and determining the effectiveness of multiple supplier
                       strategies
                     Evaluating risks to supply chains and suppliers as well as troubleshooting issues
                       in the chain
                     Analyzing inventories to determine how to increase inventory turns, reduce waste
                       or optimize customer service

                     Managing activities related to purchasing, inventory control, and warehousing
                     Coordination of supply chain with other functional areas, such as sales,
                       marketing, finance, production or quality assurance
                     Manage supply chain staff

               Operations and Supply Chain



                     In  smaller  organizations,  there  can  be  overlap  between  operations  and  supply
                       chain management. One person or department can manage or play a role in both
                       supply chain and operations. In part this is because Supply Chain Management
                       has  become  more  complex  over  time  and  the  demand  for  highly  trained
                       professionals  has  emerged.   Previously,  the  roles  in  SCM  were  handled  by
                       Operation’s  professionals.  Both  positions  require  leadership,  goal  setting,

                       organization,  finance,  and  decision  making.  Managers  in  both  areas  oversee
                       people, parts, and supplies. They both require the ability to communicate across
                       departments internally and externally, to lead people and teams, and to manage
                       human capital.
                     If you’re a skilled engineer or technician, but need to add these skills, a master’s
                       degree  in  operations  management  or  supply  chain  management  provides  the
                       information, training, and knowledge needed.


               But how do they differ?


                     “Overall,  supply  chain  is  sourcing  and  moving  both  the  raw  materials  and  the
                       finished  product.  Operations  management  is  the  part  in  the  middle  where  the
                       product is created from the raw materials. Supply chain is how you get it and get
                       it  to  customers.  Operations  is  how  you  make  it,”  stated  Lee  Buddress,  an
                       Associate  Professor  of  Supply  and  Logistics  Management  at  Portland  State
                       University.

               Supply Chain Management (SCM)


               SCM flows are divided into three main flows:


                     Product flow – the movement of goods from the supplier to the consumer along
                       with returns and other service requirements.
                     Information flow – transmitting orders and updating the status of delivery.
                     Finances  flow  –  includes  payment  schedules,  credit  terms,  consignment,  and
                       also title ownership arrangements.




































               Many  companies  use  sophisticated  software  systems  and/or  web-based  application
               service providers for a comprehensive supply chain management service. Further, SCM
               software systems are of two types –

                     Planning applications – use advanced algorithms to determine the best way to
                       fill an order.
                     Execution applications – track the physical status of goods, the management of
                       materials, and also financial information involving all parties.

               There are some applications which support sharing of data both outside and inside the
               organization.  This  shared  data  may  reside  in  data  warehouses  or  diverse  database
               systems, at multiple sites. Further, these applications are capable of sharing the data

               ‘upstream’  with  the  suppliers  or  ‘downstream’  with  the  clients.  Therefore,  they  can
               improve the time-to-market of products, increase cost-efficiency, and enable all parties
               to manage their resources better.

               Production and Operations Management (POM) under SCM


               Different methods of production are deployed by organizations at different stages of the
               overall process of production. Let’s look at the different types of production methods:

               Job Method

               Under  the  job  method,  a  single  worker  or  group  of  workers  handle  a  complete  task.
               These tasks/jobs can be small-scale or complex or can involve low or high technology.
               Further, the features of a good project control in a job method are:

                     Defining Objectives clearly – including dates, stages, and milestones
                     Clear decision-making process – including decisions pertaining to the task, labor,
                       and other resources.

               Low  technology  jobs: The  skills  and  technology  required  for  these  jobs  are  easily
               available.  Usually,  this  allows  the  organization  to  include  specific  customer
               requirements as the job progresses. Some examples are tailors, hairdressers, etc.

               High  technology  jobs: These  jobs  involve  greater  complexity  and  hence,  require
               skilled  management.  Project  control  or  management  is  an  important  aspect  of  such
               jobs. Some examples are large construction projects, film production, etc.

               Batch Method


               With increased volumes, businesses usually seek to organize the production process by
               creating  batches.  The  batch  method requires  the  division  of  tasks  in  sub-parts  or
               operations. Once this is done, each operation is completed for the entire batch before
               the next operation is started.

               This allows organizations to achieve specialization of labor. Also, enterprises can plan
               carefully to ensure that the production equipment is not idle and keep a tight leash on
               capital expenditure. Therefore, the primary goals of the batch method are:

                     Concentration of skills
                     Achievement of maximum utilization of equipment

               Most  organizations  use  the  batch  method  to  organize  the  manufacturing  process.
               Production of electronic instruments is a good example of the batch method.



                                                             88]]></page><page Index="548"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY             Department of Management
                        Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus  BMGT25: Operations Management


               However, the batch method has its own problems. There is always a chance of a poor
               workflow if batches are not of the optimal size or there is a difference in productivity by
               each operation in the process. Also, these methods usually have a significant number of
               completed batches waiting for their turn in the next operation.


               Flow Methods


               The  problem  of  batch  queuing  is  eliminated  in  the  flow  method.  It  is  a  method  of
               production  where  a  task is worked  on continuously  or the  processing  of  a  material  is
               continuous and progressive. Further, the primary goals of the flow methods are:

                     Improved workflow
                     Better flow of materials
                     Lesser need for specific labor skills
                     Also, faster completion of work

               Under the flow  methods,  as soon  as the  work  on  a  particular stage is complete, it is
               passed to the next stage without waiting for the remaining tasks in the batch. Also, on
               arriving at the next stage, work on the next process is started immediately. Further, the
               flow  stays  smooth  if  each  task  takes  the  same  time  on  each  stage  and  there  is  no
               movement away from the production flow.

               Requirements for Flow Methods to work well:


                     There  should  be  a  constant  demand.  If  the  demand  is  irregular  or
                       unpredictable, then the flow production line can end up with a substantial build-
                       up  of  stocks  and  face  storage  difficulties.  Some  businesses  work  around  this
                       problem  by  keeping  the  flow  line  working  even  during  quiet  periods  for  the
                       efficient production of output.
                     Standardized  products  and/or  production  tasks.  Flow  methods  are  not
                       flexible and cannot deal with variations in the product effectively (barring a few
                       minor variations).
                     Materials  of  standard  quality  and  delivered  on  time.  A  flow  production  line
                       works continuously. Therefore, it is important that the materials are homogenous
                       and delivered on time. This also ensures that the production line does not come
                       to a standstill and cost the company.
                     Careful  definition  of  each  operation  in  the  production  flow  and  detailed
                       recording of the same.
                     Quality standards maintained at each stage. In the flow methods, the output
                       from  each stage continuously  moves forward. Therefore, there is  no scope for
                       reworking sub-standard  output  at  any stage. Hence, it is  important that  quality
                       standards are maintained at each stage of the production flow.

                        Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus  BMGT25: Operations Management


               Why is Supply Chain Management Important in Operations Management?

               Both operations management and supply chain management are expected to add value
               to  the  business,  supporting  more  efficient  processes  and  ultimately  driving  better
               revenue  for  the  company.  In  fact,  in  pursuit  of  those  objectives,  the  two  roles  are
               inextricably linked together. Supply chain management controls the process  for having
               the product  produced;  without  it,  operations management  wouldn’t have  a  product to
               oversee operations for.


               Many industries require both supply chain management and operations management,
               whether the business is moving services, products, raw materials, data or money into
               the hands of its customers.


               In smaller organizations, it’s also possible for these roles to overlap or be fulfilled by a
               single person or department, as the necessary skillset for both roles is similar, including:

                     Organization
                     Decision-making
                     Goal-setting
                     Cross-functional leadership
                     Communication

               II. ELECTRONIC DATA INTERCHARGE


               Electronic Data Interchange is the exchange of business documents and data (invoices,
               orders, order responses, dispatching and receiving advice documents) across a variety
               of  platforms  in  the  form  of  electronic  messages  between  the  IT  systems  of  business
               partners. The benefits  of moving from  a  paper-based  exchange  of documents to EDI
               services include reduced errors, faster document processing, automated workflows, and
               improved business-partners relationships. Read this blog post to explore the technical
               architecture of the EDI network and its benefits for ERP.

               Key Benefits of the Electronic Data Interchange:
               Reduced Costs:

               *  EDI  transactions  reduce  expenses  related  to  paper,  printing,  copy,  storage,  filing,
               postage  and  document  retrieval.  In  addition,  EDI  lowers  the  dealings  prices  by  a
               minimum of 35%

               * A major electronics manufacturer calculates the value of process an order manually at
               $38 compared to only $1.35 for an order processed mistreatment EDI


               *  EDI  saves  employees  valuable  time  by  reducing  errors  caused  due  to  unreadable
               faxes, lost orders or incorrectly taken phone orders.


               Enhanced Speed and Accuracy:

               * EDI speeds up your business cycles by 61%. Exchange transactions in minutes rather
               than the times or weeks of wait time from the postal service


               *  EDI  improves  data  quality,  delivering  a  minimum  of  a  30–40%  reduction  in
               transactions  with  errors  —  eliminating  errors  from  marked-up  handwriting,  lost
               faxes/mail and keying, and re-keying errors.

               *  Using  EDI  will  scale  back  the  order-to-cash  cycle  time  by  quite  the  200th,  rising
               business partner transactions and relationships.



                                                             91]]></page><page Index="551"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY             Department of Management

               Increased Efficiency:


               *  Automating  paper-based  tasks  enables  business  executives  to  invest  more  time  in
               higher-value tasks


               * Faster processing of business documents results in less re-working of orders, fewer
               stock-outs and reduced off orders.

               *  Automating  the  exchange  information  between  applications  ensures  that  business-
               critical data is distributed on time

               *  Shortening  the  order  process  and  delivery  times  means  organizations  will  cut  back
               their inventory levels.


               Improved Business Strategies

               *  Enables  period  of  time  visibility  into  transaction  status.  This  successively  allows
               quicker  decision-making  and  improved  responsiveness  to  dynamic  client  and  market
               demands and permits businesses to adopt a demand-driven business model instead of
               a supply-driven one.


               * EDI reduces the lead times for product enhancements and new product delivery.

               * Streamlines your ability to enter new territories and markets. EDI provides a standard
               business  language  that  facilitates  business  partner  onboarding  anyplace  within  the
               world.

               * Promotes company social responsibility and sustainability by substitution paper-based
               processes with  electronic  alternatives. this may  each prevent cash and cut back  your
               co2 emissions.

                 III. PARTICIPANTS IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN


               In its simplest form, a supply chain is composed of a company and the suppliers and
               customers of that company. This is the basic group of participants that creates a simple
               supply  chain.  Extended  supply  chains  contain  three  additional  types  of
               participants.   First  there  is  the  supplier’s  supplier  or  the  ultimate  supplier  at  the
               beginning  of  an  extended  supply  chain.   Then  there  is  the  customer’s  customer  or
               ultimate  customer  at  the  end  of  an  extended  supply  chain.   Finally  there  is  a  whole
               category  of  companies  who  are  service  providers  to  other  companies  in  the  supply
               chain.  These are companies who supply services in logistics, finance, marketing, and
               information technology.





                                                             92]]></page><page Index="552"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY             Department of Management
                        Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus  BMGT25: Operations Management


               In  any  given  supply  chain  there  is  some  combination  of  companies  who  perform
               different  functions.   There  are  companies  that  are  producers,  companies  that  are
               distributors  or  wholesalers,  companies  that  are  retailers,  and  companies  or
               individuals  that  are  the  customers  who  are  the  final  consumers  of  a
               product.  Supporting these four kinds of companies there are other companies that are
               service providers providing a range of needed services. In this post we’ll look at the four
               main participants in every supply chain.



















               Producers
               Producers  or  manufacturers  are  organizations  that  make  a  product.   This  includes
               companies that  are  producers  of raw  materials  and companies that  are  producers  of
               finished  goods.  Producers  of raw materials  are  organizations that mine for  minerals,
               drill for  oil  and gas,  and cut timber.  It  also  includes  organizations that farm the land,
               raise animals, or catch seafood.  Producers of finished goods use the raw materials and
               sub-assemblies made by other producers to create their products.


               Distributors
               Distributors  are  companies  that  take  inventory  in  bulk  from  producers  and  deliver  a
               bundle  of  related  product  lines  to  customers.  Distributors  are  also  known  as
               wholesalers.   They  typically  sell  to  other  businesses  and  they  sell  products  in  larger
               quantities  that  an  individual  consumer  would  usually  buy.   Distributors  buffer  the
               producers from fluctuations in product demand by stocking inventory and doing much of
               the sales work to find and service customers.  For the customer, distributors fulfill the
               “Time and Place” function – they deliver products when and where the customer wants
               them.


               A distributor is typically an organization that takes ownership of significant inventories of
               products that they  buy from  producers  and sell  to consumers.   In  addition to  product
               promotion and sales, other functions the distributor performs are ones such as inventory
               management,  warehouse  operations  and  product  transportation  as  well  as  customer
               support  and  post  sales  service.  A  distributor  can  also  be  an  organization  that  only
               brokers a product between the producer and the customer and never takes ownership


                                                             93]]></page><page Index="553"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY             Department of Management

               of  that  product.   This  kind  of  distributor  performs  mainly  the  functions  of  product
               promotion and sales. In both these cases, as the needs of customers evolve and the
               range of available products changes, the distributor is the agent that continually tracks
               customer needs and matches them with products available.


               Retailers

               Retailers  stock  inventory  and  sell  in  smaller  quantities  to  the  general  public.   This
               organization also closely tracks the preferences and demands of the customers that it
               sells  to.   It  advertises  to  its  customers  and  often  uses  some  combination  of  price,
               product selection, service, and convenience as the primary draw to attract customers for
               the products it sells.  Discount department stores attract customers using price and wide
               product  selection.   Upscale  specialty  stores  offer  a  unique  line  of  products  and  high
               levels of service.  Fast food restaurants use convenience and low prices as their draw.


               Customers
               Customers  or  consumers  are  any  organization  that  purchase  and  use  a  product.   A
               customer  organization  may  be  an  organization  that  purchases  a  product  in  order  to
               incorporate  it  into  another  product  that  they  in  turn  sell  to  other  customers.   Or  a
               customer  may  be  the  final  end  user  of  a  product  who  buys  the  product  in  order  to
               consume it.

                                         THE ROLE OF BUSINESS RESEARCH


                       Business research is the application of the scientific method in searching for the truth
               about  business  phenomena.  These  activities  include  defining  business  opportunities  and

               problems, generating, and evaluating alternative courses of action, and monitoring employee
               and organizational performance. Business research is more than conducting surveys. This
               process  includes  idea  and  theory  development,  problem  definition,  searching  for  and

               collecting information, analyzing data, and communicating the findings and their implications.
                       This  definition  suggests  that  business  research  information  is  not  intuitive  or
               haphazardly  gathered.  Literally,  research  (re-search)  means  “to  search  again.”  The  term

               connotes patient study and scientific investigation wherein the researcher takes another, more
               careful look at the data to discover all that is known about the subject. Ultimately, all findings

               are tied back to the underlying theory. The definition also emphasizes, through reference to
               the scientific method, that any information generated should be accurate and objective. The
               nineteenth-century American humorist Artemus Ward claimed, “It ain’t the things we don’t

               know that gets us in trouble. It’s the things we know that ain’t so.” In other words, research
               isn’t  performed  to  support  preconceived  ideas  but  to  test  them.  The  researcher  must  be

               personally detached and free of bias in attempting to find truth. If bias enters into the research
               process, the value of the research is considerably reduced.
                       Our  definition  makes  it  clear  that  business  research  is  designed  to  facilitate  the

               managerial  decision-making  process  for  all  aspects  of  the  business:  finance,  marketing,
               human  resources,  and  so  on.  Business  research  is  an  essential  tool  for  management  in
               virtually  all  problem-solving  and  decision-making  activities.  By  providing  the  necessary

               information on which to base business decisions, research can decrease the risk of making a]]></page><page Index="560"><![CDATA[wrong  decision  in  each  area.  However,  it  is  important  to  note  that  research  is  an  aid  to
               managerial  decision  making,  never  a  substitute  for  it.  Finally,  this  definition  of  business

               research is limited by one’s definition of business. Certainly, research regarding production,
               finance, marketing, and management in for-profit corporations However, business research
               also  includes  efforts  that  assist  nonprofit  For  instance,  the  Food  and  Drug  Administration

               (FDA) is an important user of research, employing it to address the way people view and use
               various food and drugs.

                       Applied business research is conducted to address a specific business decision for
               a specific firm or organization.
                       Basic business research conducted without a specific decision in mind that usually

               does not address the needs of a specific organization. It attempts to expand the limits of
               knowledge in general and is not aimed at solving a particular pragmatic problem.


               The Scientific Method
                       All research, whether basic or applied, involves the scientific method. The scientific

               method is the way researchers go about using knowledge and evidence to reach objective
               conclusions about the real world. The scientific method is the same in social sciences, such
               as business, as in physical sciences, such as physics. In this case, it is the way we come to

               understand business phenomena.
                       In  basic  research,  testing  these  prior  conceptions  or  hypotheses  and  then  making
               inferences and conclusions about the phenomena leads to the establishment of general laws

               about the phenomena. Use of the scientific method in applied research ensures objectivity in
               gathering facts and testing creative ideas for alternative business strategies. The essence of

               research, whether basic or applied, lies in the scientific method. Much of this book deals with
               scientific methodology. Thus, the techniques of basic and applied research differ largely in
               degree rather than in substance.]]></page><page Index="561"><![CDATA[Managerial Value of Business Research
                       In all of business strategy, there are only a few business orientations (see Exhibit 1.2).

               A firm can be product oriented. A product-oriented firm prioritizes decision making in a way
               that emphasizes technical superiority in the product. Thus, research gathering information
               from technicians and experts in the field are very important in making critical decisions. A firm

               can be production oriented. Production orientation means that the firm prioritizes efficiency
               and effectiveness of the production processes in making decisions. Here, research providing

               input from workers, engineers, finance, and accounting becomes important as the firm seeks
               to  drive  costs  down.  Production-oriented  firms  are  usually  very  large  firms  manufacturing
               products in very large quantities. The third is marketing-oriented, which focuses more on how

               the firm provides value to customers than on the physical product or production process. With
               a marketing-oriented organization the majority of research focuses on the customer. Research

               addressing consumer desires, beliefs, and attitudes becomes essential.






























                       The prime managerial value of business research is that it provides information that
               improves  the  decision-making  process.  The  decision-making  process  associated  with  the
               development and implementation of a business strategy involves four interrelated stages:

                       1. Identifying problems or opportunities
                       2. Diagnosing and assessing problems or opportunities

                       3. Selecting and implementing a course of action
                       4. Evaluating the course of action
                       Business research, by supplying managers with pertinent information, may play an

               important role by reducing managerial uncertainty in each of these stages.]]></page><page Index="562"><![CDATA[Identifying Problems or Opportunities
                       Before any strategy can be developed, an organization must determine where it wants

               to  go  and  how  it  will  get  there.  Business  research  can  help  managers  plan  strategies  by
               determining the nature of situations or by identifying the existence of problems or opportunities
               present in the organization. Business research may be used as a scanning activity to provide

               information about what is occurring within an organization or in its environment. The mere
               description of some social or economic activity may familiarize managers with organizational

               and environmental occurrences and help them understand a situation. Consider these two
               examples:
                        •  The  description  of  the  dividend  history  of  stocks  in  an  industry  may  point  to  an

               attractive investment opportunity. Information supplied by business research may also indicate
               problems.

                        •  Employee  interviews  undertaken  to  characterize  the  dimensions  of  an  airline
               reservation clerk’s job may reveal that reservation clerks emphasize competence in issuing
               tickets over courtesy and friendliness in customer contact.

                       Once business research indicates a problem or opportunity, managers may feel that
               the alternatives are clear enough to make a decision based on their experience or intuition.
               However, often they decide that more business research is needed to generate additional

               information for a better understanding of the situation.

               Diagnosing and Assessing Problems or Opportunities

                        After  an  organization  recognizes  a  problem  or  identifies  a  potential  opportunity,
               business research can help clarify the situation. Managers need to gain insight about the

               underlying  factors  causing  the  situation.  If  there  is  a  problem,  they  need  to  specify  what
               happened and why. If an opportunity exists, they may need to explore, refine, and quantity the
               opportunity. If multiple opportunities exist, research may be conducted to set priorities.


               Selecting and Implementing a Course of Action

                       After the alternative courses of action have been clearly identified, business research
               is often conducted to obtain specific information that will aid in evaluating the alternatives and
               in selecting the best course of action.


               Evaluating the Course of Action
                       After a course of action has been implemented, business research may serve as a tool

               to  tell  managers  whether  or  not  planned  activities  were  properly  executed  and  if  they
               accomplished what they were expected to accomplish. In other words, managers may use
               evaluation research to provide feedback for evaluation and control of strategies and tactics.]]></page><page Index="563"><![CDATA[✓  Evaluation research is the formal, objective measurement and appraisal of the extent
                       a  given  activity,  project,  or  program  has  achieved  its  objectives.  In  addition  to

                       measuring  the  extent  to  which  completed  programs  achieved  their  objectives  or
                       whether  continuing  programs  are  presently  performing  as  projected,  evaluation
                       research may provide information about the major factors influencing the observed

                       performance levels. In addition to business organizations, nonprofit organizations and
                       governmental agencies frequently conduct evaluation research.


                   ✓  Performance-monitoring  research  is  a  specific  type  of  evaluation  research  that
                       regularly,  perhaps  routinely,  provides  feedback  for  the  evaluation  and  control  of

                       recurring business activity.


               When Is Business Research Needed?
                       The need to make intelligent, informed decisions ultimately motivates an organization
               to engage in business research. Not every decision requires research. Thus, when confronting

               a key decision, a manager must initially decide whether or not to conduct business research.
               The determination of the need for research centers on
                       (1) time constraints,

                       (2) the availability of data,
                       (3) the nature of the decision to be made, and
                       (4) the value of the research information in relation to costs.

               ✓  Time Constraints
                       Systematic  research  takes  time.  In  many  instances,  management  believes  that  a

               decision must be made immediately, allowing no time for research. Decisions sometimes are
               made  without  adequate  information  or  thorough  understanding  of  the  business  situation.
               Although making decisions without researching a situation is not ideal, sometimes the urgency

               of a situation precludes the use of research. The urgency with which managers usually want
               to make decisions conflicts with researchers’ desire for rigor in following the scientific method.

               ✓  Availability of Data
                       Often  managers  already  possess  enough  data,  or  information,  to  make  sound
               decisions  without  additional  research.  When  they  lack  adequate  information,  however,

               research must be considered. This means that data need to be collected from an appropriate
               source. If a potential source of data exists, managers will want to know how much it will cost
               to get the data.

                       If  the  data  cannot  be  obtained,  or  it  cannot  be  obtained  in  a  timely  fashion,  this
               particular research project should not be conducted. For example, many African nations have

               ✓  Nature of the Decision
                       The value of business research will depend on the nature of the managerial decision
               to be made. A routine tactical decision that does not require a substantial investment may not

               seem to warrant a substantial expenditure for research. For example, a computer company
               must update its operator’s instruction manual when it makes minor product modifications. The

               research cost of determining the proper wording to use in the updated manual is likely to be
               too high for such a minor decision. The nature of the decision is not totally independent of the
               next issue to be considered: the benefits versus the costs of the research. In general, however,

               the more strategically or tactically important the decision, the more likely it is that research will
               be conducted.

               ✓  Benefits versus Costs
                       Earlier we discussed some of the managerial benefits of business research. Of course,
               conducting  research  to  obtain  these  benefits  requires  an  expenditure  of  money.  In  any

               decision-making  situation,  managers  must  identify  alternative  courses  of  action  and  then
               weigh the value of each alternative against its cost. Business research can be thought of as
               an investment alternative. When deciding whether to make a decision without research or to

               postpone the decision in order to conduct research, managers should ask three questions:
                1. Will the payoff or rate of return be worth the investment?
                2. Will the information gained by business research improve the quality of the managerial

               decision enough to warrant the expenditure?
                3. Is the proposed research expenditure the best use of the available funds?




















               Overview of Business Research

                       The business research process is often presented as a linear, sequential process, with
               one specific step following another. In reality, this is not the case. For example, the time spent
               on  each  step  varies,  overlap  between  steps  is  common,  some  stages  may  be  omitted,]]></page><page Index="565"><![CDATA[occasionally we need to backtrack, and the order sometimes changes. Nonetheless, some

                             INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT


               Information, Data, and Intelligence
                   Data  -  Facts  or  recorded  measures  of

               certain phenomena (things).
                   Information - Data formatted (structured) to

               support  decision  making  or  define  the
               relationship between two facts.
                   Business intelligence - The subset of data

               and  information  that  actually  has  some
               explanatory power enabling effective decisions

               to be made.

               The Characteristics of Valuable Information

                       Not  all  data  are  valuable  to  decision
               makers.  Useful  data  become  information  and
               help a business manager make decisions. Useful data can also become intelligence. Four

               characteristics help determine how useful data may be: relevance, quality, timeliness, and
               completeness.]]></page><page Index="566"><![CDATA[Relevance
                       Relevance is the characteristics of data reflecting how pertinent these particular facts

               are to the situation at hand. Put another way, the facts are logically connected to the situation.
               Unfortunately,  irrelevant  data  and  information  often  creep  into  decision  making.  One
               particularly useful way to distinguish relevance from irrelevance is to think about how things

               change. Relevant data are facts about things that can be changed, and if they are changed, it
               will materially alter the situation. So, this simple question becomes important: Will a change in

               the data coincide with a change in some important outcome?
               Quality
                       Data quality is the degree to which data represent the true situation. High-quality data

               are accurate, valid, and reliable, issues we discuss in detail in later chapters. High-quality data
               represent reality faithfully. If a consumer were to replace the product UPC from one drill at

               Home Depot with one from a different drill, not only would the consumer be acting unethically,
               but it would also mean that the data collected at the checkout counter would be inaccurate.
               Therefore,  to  the  extent  that  the  cash  register  is  not  actually  recording  the  products  that

               consumers take out of the stores, its quality is lowered. Sometimes, researchers will try to
               obtain the same data from multiple data sources as one check on its quality. Data quality is a
               critical issue in business research.

               Timeliness
                       Business is a dynamic field in which out-of-date information can lead to poor decisions.
               Business  information  must  be  timely—that  is,  provided  at  the  right  time.  Computerized

               information systems can record events and dispense relevant information soon after the event.
               A  great  deal  of  business  information  becomes  available  almost  at  the  moment  that  a

               transaction occurs. Timeliness means that the data are current enough to still be relevant.
               Computer technology has redefined standards for timely information.
               Completeness

                       Information completeness refers to having the right amount of information. Managers
               must have sufficient information about all aspects of their decisions.

                       If information about unemployment or other characteristics cannot be obtained, the
               information is incomplete. Often incomplete information leads decision makers to conduct their
               own business research.

               Knowledge Management
                       Knowledge  is  a  blend  of  previous  experience,  insight,  and  data  that  forms
               organizational  memory.  It  provides  a  framework  that  can  be  thoughtfully  applied  when

               assessing  a  business  problem.  Business  researchers  and  decision  makers  use  this
               knowledge to help create solutions to strategic and tactical problems. Thus, knowledge is a
               key resource and a potential competitive advantage.]]></page><page Index="567"><![CDATA[Knowledge  management  is  the  process  of  creating  an  inclusive,  comprehensive,
               easily accessible organizational memory, which can be called the organization’s intellectual

               capital. The purpose of knowledge management is to organize the intellectual capital of an
               organization in a formally structured way for easy use. Knowledge is presented in a way that
               helps managers comprehend and act on that information and make better decisions in all

               areas of business.
                       Knowledge  management  systems  are  particularly  useful  in  making  data  available

               across  the  functional  areas  of  the  firm.  Thus,  marketing,  management,  and  financial
               knowledge can be integrated. Recent research demonstrates how knowledge management
               systems are particularly useful in new product development and introduction.

               Global Information Systems
                       An organized collection of computer hardware, software, data, and personnel designed

               to  capture,  store,  update, manipulate,  analyze, and  immediately  display  information  about
               worldwide business activity.
               A global information system is a tool for providing past, present, and projected information on

               internal  operations  and  external  activity.  Using  satellite  communications,  high-speed
               microcomputers, electronic data interchanges, fiber optics, data storage devices, and other
               technological  advances  in  interactive  media,  global  information  systems  are  changing  the

               nature of business
               Decision Support Systems
                       Business research can be described in many ways. One way is to categorize research

               based on the four possible functions it serves in business:
                    1. Foundational—answers basic questions. What business should we be in?

                    2.  Testing—addresses  things  like  new  product  concepts  or  promotional  ideas.  How
               effective will they be?
                    3.  Issues—examines  how  specific  issues  impact  the  firm.  How  does  organizational

               structure impact employee job satisfaction and turnover?
                    4.  Performance—monitors  specific metrics  including  financial  statistics  like  profitability

               and delivery times. They are critical in real-time management and in “what-if” types of analyses
               examining the potential impact of a change in policy.
                    A  decision  support  system  (DSS)  is  a  system  that  helps  decision  makers  confront

               problems  through  direct  interaction  with  computerized  databases  and  analytical  software
               programs. The purpose of a decision support system is to store data and transform them into
               organized information that is easily accessible to managers.]]></page><page Index="568"><![CDATA[A  decision  support  system  requires  both  databases  and  software.  For  firms
               operating across national borders, the DSS becomes part of its global information system.

               Databases and Data Warehousing
                       A database is a collection of raw data arranged logically and organized in a form that

               can be stored and processed by a computer. A customer mailing list is one type of database.
               Population characteristics may be recorded by state, county, and city in another database.
               Production  figures  and costs  can  come from  internal  company records. Modern  computer

               technology makes  both the storage  and retrieval  of  this  information  easy  and  convenient.
               Twenty years ago, the population data needed to do a retail site analysis may have required
               days, possibly weeks, in a library. Today, the information is just a few clicks away.

                       Data warehousing is the process allowing important day-to-day operational data to
               be stored and organized for simplified access. More specifically, a data warehouse is the multi-
               tiered  computer  storehouse  of  current  and  historical  data.  Data  warehouse  management

               requires that the detailed database A collection of raw data arranged logically and organized
               in a form that can be stored and processed by a computer.

                       Scanner  data  refers  to  the  accumulated  records  resulting  from  point-of-sale  data
               recordings.  In  other  words,  each  time  products  are  scanned  at  a  checkout  counter,  the
               information can be stored.

                       The  term  single-source data  refers  to  a  system’s  ability  to  gather several  types  of
               interrelated data, such as type of purchase, use of a sales promotion, or advertising frequency

               data, from a single source in a format that will facilitate integration, comparison, and analysis.

               Statistical Databases

                       Statistical  databases  contain  numerical  data  for  analysis  and  forecasting.  Often
               demographic, sales, and other relevant business variables are recorded by geographical area.
               Geographic information systems use these geographical databases and powerful software to

               prepare computer maps of relevant variables. One source for these huge data warehouses is
               scanner data. Substituting electronic recordkeeping like optical scanners for human record-
               keeping results in greater accuracy and more rapid feedback about store activity.]]></page><page Index="569"><![CDATA[Financial Databases

                       Competitors’ and customers’ financial data, such as income statements and balance
               sheets, are of obvious interest to business managers. These are easy to access in financial
               databases. CompuStat publishes an extensive financial database on thousands of companies,

               broken down by industry and other criteria.


               Video Databases
                       Video databases and streaming media are having a major impact on many goods and
               services. For example, movie studios provide clips of upcoming films and advertising agencies

               put television commercials on the Internet.


               The Internet and Research
                       Electronic  Data  Interchange  (EDI)  is  a  type  of  exchange  that  occurs  when  one
               company’s computer system is integrated with another company’s system.

                       The Internet is a worldwide network of computers that allows users access to data,
               information,  and  feedback  from  distant  sources.  It  functions  as  the  world’s  largest  public
               library,  providing  access  to  a  seemingly  endless  range  of  data.  Many  people  believe  the

               Internet is the most important communications medium since television.

               How Is the Internet Useful in Research?

                       The Internet is useful to researchers in many ways. In fact, more and more applications
               become known as the technology grows and is adopted by more and more users. The Internet

               is particularly useful as a source for accessing available data and as a way of collecting data.

               Accessing Available Data

                       The Internet allows instantaneous and effortless access to a great deal of information.
               Noncommercial and commercial organizations make a wealth of data and other resources

               available on the Internet.

               Collecting Data

                       The Internet is also revolutionizing the way researchers collect data. Later in this text,
               we discuss in more detail the use of Web-based surveys. In short, questionnaires can be
               posted  on  a  Web  site  and  respondents  can  be  invited  to  go  to  the  particular  URL  and

               participate  in  the  survey.  This  cuts  down  on  the  expense  associated  with  traditional  mail
               surveys  and  also  reduces  error  since  the  data  can  be  automatically  recorded  rather  than
               transcribed from a paper form into an electronic format]]></page><page Index="570"><![CDATA[Navigating the Internet

                       The World Wide Web (WWW) refers specifically to that portion of the Internet made up
               of servers that support a retrieval system that organizes information into documents called
               Web pages. World Wide Web documents, which may include graphic images, video clips, and

               sound clips, are formatted in programming languages, such as HTML (HyperText Markup
               Language)  and  XML  (Extensible  Markup  Language)  that  allow  for  displaying,  linking,  and

                                                  THEORY BUILDING


                       The purpose of science concerns the expansion of knowledge and the search for truth.
               Theory  building  is  the  means  by  which  basic  researchers  hope  to  achieve  this  purpose.

               Students  sometimes  think  their  classes  or  course  material  are  “too  theoretical”  or  lacking
               “practical application.” However, this should certainly not be the case. Theories are simply

               generalizations  that  help  us  better  understand  reality.  Furthermore,  theories  allow  us  to
               understand the logic behind things we observe. If a theory does not hold true in practice, then
               that theory holds no value. This chapter will provide a fundamental knowledge of theory, theory

               development, and some terminology regarding theory necessary for business researchers.

               What Is a Theory?

                       Like all abstractions, the word “theory” has been used in many different ways, in many
               different contexts, at times so broadly as to include almost all descriptive statements about a
               class of phenomena, and at other times so narrowly as to exclude everything but a series of

               terms and their relationships that satisfies certain logical requirements.]]></page><page Index="571"><![CDATA[A theory consists of a coherent set of general propositions that offer an explanation of
               some phenomena by describing the way other things correspond to these phenomena. Put

               another  way,  a  theory  is  a  formal,  testable  explanation  of  some  events  that  includes
               explanations of how things relate to one another.
                       A  theory  can  be  built  through  a  process  of  reviewing  previous  findings  of  similar

               studies, simple logical deduction, and/or knowledge of applicable theoretical areas.


               What Are the Goals of Theory?
                       Suppose a researcher investigating business phenomena wants to know what caused
               the  financial  crisis.  Another  person  wants  to  know  if  organizational  structure  influences

               leadership  style.  Both  of  these  individuals  want  to  gain  a  better  understanding  of  the
               environment and be able to predict behavior; to be able to say that if we take a particular

               course  of  action,  we  can  expect  a  specific  outcome  to  occur.  These  two  issues—
               understanding and predicting—are the two purposes of theory.
                       Accomplishing  the  first  goal  allows  the  theorist  to  gain  an  understanding  of  the

               relationship  among  various  phenomena.  For  example,  a  financial  advisor  may  believe,  or
               theorize, that older investors tend to be more interested in investment income than younger
               investors.  This  theory,  once  verified,  would  then  allow  her  to  predict  the  importance  of

               expected dividend yield based on the age of her customer. Thus a theory enables us to predict
               the  behavior  or  characteristics  of  one  phenomenon  from  the  knowledge  of  another
               phenomenon.  The  value  of  understanding  and  anticipating  future  conditions  in  the

               environment  or  in  an  organization  should  be  obvious.  In  most  situations,  of  course,
               understanding and prediction go hand in hand.


               Research Concepts, Constructs, Propositions, Variables, and Hypotheses
                       Theory development is essentially a process of describing phenomena at increasingly

               higher levels of abstraction. In other words, as business researchers, we need to be able to
               think  of  things  in  a  very  abstract  manner,  but  eventually  link  these  abstract  concepts  to

               observable reality. To understand theory and the business research process, it will be useful
               to know different terminology and how these terms relate.


               Research Concepts and Constructs
                       A  concept  or  construct  is  a  generalized  idea  about  a  class  of  objects,  attributes,
               occurrences, or processes that has been given a name. If you, as an organizational theorist,

               were  to  describe  phenomena  such  as  supervisory  behavior  or  risk  aversion,  you  would
               categorize empirical events or real things into concepts. Concepts are the building blocks of
               theory.  In  organizational  theory,  leadership,  productivity,  and  morale  are  concepts.  In  the]]></page><page Index="572"><![CDATA[theory  of  finance,  gross  national  product,  risk  aversion,  and  inflation  are  frequently  used
               concepts.  Accounting  concepts  include  assets,  liabilities,  and  depreciation.  In  marketing,

               customer satisfaction, market share, and loyalty are important concepts.

               Research Propositions and Hypotheses

                       Propositions are  statements  concerned  with the  relationships  among concepts.  A
               proposition  explains  the  logical  linkage  among  certain  concepts  by  asserting  a  universal

               connection between concepts. For example, we might propose that treating our employees
               better will make them more loyal employees. This is certainly a logical link between managerial
               actions and employee reactions but is quite general and not really testable in its current form.

                       A hypothesis is a formal statement explaining some outcome. In its simplest form, a
               hypothesis is a guess. A sales manager may hypothesize that the salespeople who are highest

               in product knowledge will be the most productive. An advertising manager may hypothesize
               that if consumers’ attitudes toward a product change in a positive direction, there will be an
               increase in consumption of the product. A human resource manager may hypothesize that job

               candidates  with  certain  majors  will  be  more  successful  employees.  A  hypothesis  is  a
               proposition that is empirically testable. In other words, when one states a hypothesis, it should
               be written in a manner that can be supported or shown to be wrong through an empirical test.

                       Empirical testing means that something has been examined against reality using
               data.



























               Understanding Theory
                       If facts conflict with a theory, either the theory must be changed or the facts.
               Verifying Theory

                   In most scientific situations there are alternative theories to explain certain phenomena.
               To determine which is the better theory, researchers make observations or gather empirical]]></page><page Index="573"><![CDATA[data to verify the theories. Maslow’s hierarchical theory of motivation offers one explanation
               of  human  behavior.  Maslow  theorizes  that  individuals  will  attempt  to  satisfy  physiological

               needs before self-esteem needs. An alternative view of motivation is provided by Freudian
               (psychoanalytic) theory, which suggests that unconscious, emotional impulses are the basic
               influences on behavior.


               Theory Building

                       Deductive reasoning is the logical process of deriving a conclusion about a specific
               instance based on a known general premise or something known to be true
                       Inductive reasoning is the logical process of establishing a general proposition on

               the basis of observation of particular facts.


               The Scientific Method
                       The  scientific  method  is  a  set  of  prescribed  procedures  for  establishing  and
               connecting  theoretical  statements  about  events, for  analyzing  empirical evidence,  and for

               predicting events yet unknown. It is useful to look at the analytic process of scientific theory
               building  as  a  series  of  stages.  While  there  is  not  complete  consensus  concerning  exact
               procedures for the scientific method, we suggest seven operations may be viewed as the

               steps involved in the application of the scientific method:

               1. Assessment of relevant existing knowledge of a phenomenon

               2. Formulation of concepts and propositions
               3. Statement of hypotheses

               4. Design of research to test the hypotheses
               5. Acquisition of meaningful empirical data
               6. Analysis and evaluation of data

               7. Proposal of an explanation of the phenomenon and statement of new problems raised by
               the research




                                        THE BUSINESS RESEARCH PROCESS

                       This chapter focuses on the relationship between business research and managerial

               decision making. Business success is determined directly by the quality of decisions made by
               key personnel. Researchers contribute to decision making in several keyways.

               These include:]]></page><page Index="574"><![CDATA[1. Helping to better define the current situation

                    6. Examining how correct a certain business theory is in a given situation.

                    The chapter introduces the types of research that allow researchers to provide input to
               key decision makers. Causality and the conditions for establishing causality are presented.
               Last but not least, the chapter discusses stages in the business research process.


                    Decision making occurs when managers choose among alternative ways of resolving

               problems  or  pursuing  opportunities.  Decision  makers  must  recognize  the  nature  of  the
               problem  or  opportunity,  identify  how  much  information  is  available,  and  recognize  what
               information they need. Every business decision can be classified on a continuum ranging from

               complete  certainty  to  absolute  ambiguity.  Research  is  a  way  that  managers  can  become
               informed  about  the  different  alternatives  and  make  an  educated  guess  about  which
               alternative, if any, is the best to pursue.

                    Uncertainty means that the manager grasps the general nature of desired objectives,
               but the information about alternatives is incomplete
                    Ambiguity means that the nature of the problem itself is unclear. Objectives are vague

               and  decision  alternatives  are  difficult  to  define.  This  is  by  far  the  most  difficult  decision
               situation, but perhaps the most common.


               Problems and Opportunities]]></page><page Index="575"><![CDATA[Depicts decision situations characterized by the nature of the decision and the degree
               of  ambiguity.  Under  problem-focused  decision  making  and  conditions  of  high  ambiguity,

               symptoms may not clearly point to some problem. Indeed, they may be quite vague or subtle,
               indicating  only  small  deviations  from  normal  conditions.  As  ambiguity  is  lessened,  the
               symptoms are clearer and are better indicators of a problem.

                       Similarly,  in  opportunity-oriented  research,  ambiguity  is  characterized  by
               environmental trends that do not suggest a clear direction. As the trends become larger and

               clearer, they are more diagnostic, meaning they point more clearly to a single opportunity.

               Types of Business Research

                       Business research is undertaken to reduce uncertainty and focus decision making. In
               more ambiguous circumstances, management may be totally unaware of a business

               problem.
                       Business research can be classified on the basis of either technique or purpose.
               Experiments, surveys, and observational studies are just a few common research

               techniques. Classifying research by its purpose, such as the situations described above,
               shows how the nature of a decision situation influences the research methodology.
                       The following section introduces the three types of business research:

                       1. Exploratory
                       2. Descriptive
                       3. Causal


                       Exploratory  research  is  conducted  to  clarify  ambiguous  situations  or  discover

               potential business opportunities. As the name implies, exploratory research is not intended to
               provide conclusive evidence from which to determine a particular course of action. In this
               sense, exploratory research is not an end unto itself. Usually exploratory research is a first

               step, conducted with the expectation that additional research will be needed to provide more
               conclusive evidence. Exploratory research is often used to guide and refine these subsequent

               research efforts.
                       Descriptive  research  is  to  describe  characteristics  of  objects,  people,  groups,
               organizations, or environments. In other words, descriptive research tries to “paint a picture”

               of a given situation by addressing who, what, when, where, and how questions.
                       Descriptive studies are conducted after the researcher has gained a firm grasp of
               the situation being studied. This understanding, which may have been developed in part from

               exploratory research, directs the study toward specific issues. Later, we will discuss the role
               of  research  questions  and  hypotheses.  These  statements  help  greatly  in  designing  and
               implementing a descriptive study.]]></page><page Index="576"><![CDATA[Causal research seeks to identify cause and-effect relationships. When something
               causes an effect, it means it brings it about or makes it happen. The effect is the outcome.

               Rain causes grass to get wet. Rain is the cause and wet grass is the effect. The different types
               of  research  discussed  here  are  often  building  blocks—exploratory  research  builds  the
               foundation for descriptive research, which usually establishes the basis for causal research.

               Thus, before causal studies are undertaken, researchers typically have a good understanding
               of the phenomena being studied. Because of this, the researcher can make an educated

               prediction  about  the  cause-and-effect  relationships  that  will  be  tested.  Although  greater
               knowledge of the situation is a good thing, it doesn’t come without a price. Causal research
               designs can take a long time to implement.


               Uncertainty Influences the Type of Research

                       So, which form of research—exploratory, descriptive, or causal—is appropriate for the
               current situation? The most appropriate type and the amount of research needed are largely
               a function of how much uncertainty surrounds the situation motivating the research.































               Stages in the Research Process

                       Business research, like other forms of scientific inquiry, involves a sequence of highly
               interrelated  activities.  The  stages  of  the  research  process  overlap  continuously,  and  it  is
               clearly an oversimplification to state that every research project has exactly the same ordered

               sequence of activities. Nevertheless, business research often follows a general pattern. We
               offer the following research business stages:
               1. Defining the research objectives

               2. Planning a research design]]></page><page Index="577"><![CDATA[3. Planning a sample
               4. Collecting the data

               5. Analyzing the data
               6. Formulating the conclusions and preparing the report


               Stages of the Research Process
                       The  circular-flow  concept  is  used  because  conclusions  from  research  studies  can

               generate new ideas and knowledge that can lead to further investigation. Thus, there is a
               dashed connection between conclusions and reporting and defining the research objectives.
               Notice also that management is in the center of the process. The research objectives cannot

               be properly defined without managerial input. After all, it is the manager who ultimately has to
               make the decision.






























               The Flowchart of Business Research]]></page><page Index="578"><![CDATA[The research process begins with research objectives. Research objectives are the
               goals to be achieved by conducting research. In consulting, the term deliverables is often used

               to describe the objectives to a research client. The genesis of the research objectives lies in
               the type of decision situation faced. The objectives may involve exploring the possibilities of
               entering a new market. Alternatively, they may involve testing the effect of some policy change

               on employee job satisfaction.
                       Different types of objectives lead to different types of research designs. In applied

               business  research,  the  objectives  cannot  really  be  determined  until  there  is  a  clear
               understanding of the managerial decision to be made. This understanding must be shared
               between  the  actual  decision  maker  and  the  lead  researcher.  We  often  describe  this

               understanding as a problem statement. In general usage, the word problem suggests that
               something has gone wrong. This isn’t always the case before research gets started. Actually,

               the research objective may be to simply clarify a situation, define an opportunity, or monitor
               and evaluate current business operations. The research objectives cannot be developed until
               managers  and  researchers  have  agreed  on  the  actual  business  “problem”  that  will  be

               addressed by the research. Thus, they set out to “discover” this problem through a series of
               interviews and through a document called a research proposal. It should be noted that this
               process is oriented more toward discovery than confirmation or justification.


               Stating Research Objectives
                       After identifying and clarifying the problem, with or without exploratory research, the

               researcher must formally state the research objectives. This statement delineates the type of
               research that is needed and what intelligence may result that would allow the decision maker

               to make informed choices. The statement of research objectives culminates the process of
               clarifying the managerial decision into something actionable. A written decision statement
               expresses  the  business  situation  to  the  researcher  and  makes  sure  that  managers  and

               researchers are on the same page.
                       The research objectives try to directly address the decision statement or statements,

               as  the  case  may  be.  As  such,  the  research  objectives  represent  a  contract  of  sorts  that
               commits the researcher to producing the needed research. This is why they are expressed as
               deliverables in applied business research. These research objectives drive the rest of the

               research process. Indeed, before proceeding, the researcher and managers must agree that
               the objectives are appropriate and will produce relevant information.


               Linking Decision Statements, Objectives, And Hypotheses
                       Hypothesis should be logically derived from and linked to our research objectives.
               How  decision  statements  are  linked  to  research  objectives,  which  are  linked  to  research]]></page><page Index="579"><![CDATA[hypotheses. Although the first two objectives each have one hypothesis, notice that the third
               has two. In reality, most research projects will involve more than one research objective, and

               each of these may often involve more than one hypothesis.



















               Planning the Research Design

                       A research design is a master plan that specifies the methods and procedures for
               collecting and analyzing the needed information. A research design provides a framework or
               plan of action for the research. Objectives of the study determined during the early stages of

               research are included in the design to ensure that the information collected is appropriate for
               solving  the  problem.  The  researcher  also must determine  the  sources of  information,  the
               design technique (survey or experiment, for example), the sampling methodology, and the

               schedule and cost of the research.
               Gathering Data

                       The data gathering stage begins once the sampling plan has been formalized. Data
               gathering  is  the  process  of  gathering  or  collecting  information.  Data  may  be  gathered  by
               human observers or interviewers, or they may be recorded by machines as in the case of

               scanner data and Web-based surveys.
               Processing and Analyzing Data

                       Editing and Coding
                       This is part of the data processing and analysis stage. Here, the information content
               will be mined from the raw data. Data processing generally begins with editing and coding the

               data.  Editing  involves  checking  the  data  collection  forms  for  omissions,  legibility,  and
               consistency in classification. The editing process corrects problems such as interviewer errors
               (an answer recorded on the wrong portion of a questionnaire, for example) before the data

               are transferred to the computer. Before data can be tabulated, meaningful categories and
               character symbols must be established for groups of responses.
                       Data Analysis

                       Data analysis is the application of reasoning to understand the data that have been
               gathered.  In  its  simplest  form,  analysis  may  involve  determining  consistent  patterns  and]]></page><page Index="580"><![CDATA[summarizing  the  relevant  details  revealed  in  the  investigation.  The  appropriate  analytical
               technique for data analysis will be determined by management’s information requirements,

               the characteristics of the research design, and the nature of the data gathered. Statistical
               analysis  may  range  from  portraying  a  simple  frequency  distribution  to  more  complex
               multivariate analyses approaches, such as multiple regression. Later chapters will discuss

               three  general  categories  of  statistical  analysis:  univariate  analysis,  bivariate  analysis,  and
               multivariate analysis.


               Drawing Conclusions and Preparing a Report
                       One  of  the  most  important  jobs  that  a  researcher  performs  is  communicating  the

               research results. This is the final stage of the research project, but it is far from the least
               important. The conclusions and report preparation stage consists of interpreting the research

               results, describing the implications, and drawing the appropriate conclusions for managerial
               decisions. These conclusions should fulfill the deliverables promised in the research proposal.
               In  addition,  it’s  important  that  the  researcher  consider  the  varying  abilities  of  people  to

               understand the research results.



                  THE HUMAN SIDE OF BUSINESS RESEARCH: ORGANIZATIONAL AND ETHICAL
                                                        ISSUES


                       Research is sometimes performed in-house, meaning that employees of the company
               that will benefit from the research project actually perform the research. In other cases, the

               research is performed by an outside agency, meaning that the company that will benefit from
               the research results hires an independent, outside firm to perform a research project. While it
               would  seem  that  in-house  research  would  usually  be  of  higher  quality  because  of  the

               increased knowledge of the researchers conducting the studies, there are several reasons
               why employees of the firm may not always be the best people to do the job. When the firm

               facing a decision encounters one of the following situations, they should consider having the
               research performed by an outside agency:
                       Outside  agency  An  independent  research  firm  contracted  by  the  company  that

               actually will benefit from the research.

                       As in all human interactions, ethical issues exist in research. Our earlier discussion of
               potential  organizational  politics  and  the  implication  of  different  goals  or  perspectives

               introduced a situation where ethics can come into play. This book considers various ethical
               issues concerning fair business dealings, proper research techniques, and appropriate use of
               research results in other chapters. The remainder of this chapter addresses society’s and

               managers’ concerns about the ethical implications of business research.
                       Business  ethics  The  application  of  morals  to  behavior  related  to  the  exchange

               environment.

                       Ethical dilemma Refers to a situation in which one chooses from alternative courses
               of actions, each with different ethical implications.


               Rights and Obligations of the Research Participant
                       Informed consent When an individual understands what the researcher wants him or

               her to do and consents to the research study.

               The Obligation To Be Truthful

                       Confidentiality The information involved in a research study will not be shared with
               others.


               Participant’s Right To Privacy
                       Active Research Most people relish their privacy. Hence, the right to privacy is an

               important issue in business research. This issue involves the participant’s freedom to choose
               whether to comply with the investigator’s request. Traditionally, researchers have assumed
               that individuals make an informed choice. However, critics have argued that the old, the poor,

               the poorly educated, and other underprivileged individuals may be unaware of their right to]]></page><page Index="582"><![CDATA[choose. They have further argued that an interviewer may begin with some vague explanation
               of a survey’s purpose, initially ask questions that are relatively innocuous, and then move to

               questions of a highly personal nature. It has been suggested that subjects be informed of their
               right to be left alone or to break off the interview at any time. Researchers should not follow
               the tendency to “hold on” to busy respondents.


               Rights and Obligations of the Researcher

                       Research  staff  and  research  support  firms  should  practice  good  business  ethics.
               Researchers are often the focus of discussions of business ethics because of the necessity
               that they interact with the public.]]></page><page Index="583"><![CDATA[Individual Case Study #1

                                            BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING?


                       Technology is making our behavior more and more difficult to keep secret. Right at this
               very moment, there is probably some way that your location can be tracked in a way that
               researchers could use the information. Do you have your mobile phone with you? Is there an

               RFID tag in your shirt, your backpack, or some other personal item? Are you in your car, and
               does it have a GPS (Global Positioning Satellite) device? All of these are ways that your

               location and movements might be tracked.
                       For instance, rental cars can be tracked using GPS. Suppose a research firm contracts
               with an insurance firm to study the way people drive when using a rental car. A customer’s

               every  movement  is  then  tracked.  So,  if  the  customer  stops  at  a  fast-food  restaurant,  the
               researcher knows. If the customer goes to the movie when he or she should be on a sales
               call, the researcher knows. If the customer is speeding, the researcher knows.

                       Clearly,  modern  technology  is  making  confidentiality  more  and  more  difficult  to
               maintain. While legitimate uses of this type of technology may assist in easing traffic patterns
               and providing better locations for service stations, shopping developments, and other retailers,

               at what point does the collection of such information become a concern? When would you
               become concerned about having your whereabouts constantly tracked?



               Question:

                       Suppose a research firm is approached by the state legislature and asked to provide
               data about vehicle movement within the state for all cars with a satellite tracking mechanism.
               Based on the movement of the cars over a certain time, the police can decide when a car was

               speeding. They intend to use this data to send speeding tickets to those who moved too far,
               too  fast.  If  you  are  the  research  firm,  would  you  supply  the  data?  Discuss  the  ethical]]></page><page Index="584"><![CDATA[implications of the decision. What will you be in this case, an ethical idealist or an ethical

                                      Beginning Stages of the Research Process


                                                                            Week 3 – September 21 - 25, 2020

                     “The harder you work for something, the greater you’ll feel when you achieved it.”

                Chapter Learning Outcomes

                By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:
                1. explain why proper “problem definition” is essential to business research

                2. translate managerial decision statements into relevant research objectives
                3. recognize technological advances in the application of qualitative research approaches



                        PROBLEM DEFINITION: THE FOUNDATION OF BUSINESS RESEARCH

               Importance of Starting with a Good Problem Definition

                       The first stage of the research process introduced in the early chapters and highlighted
               in  translating  the  business  decision  situation  into  specific  research  objectives.  While  it  is
               tempting to skip this step and go directly to designing a research project, the chances that a

               research  project  will  prove  useful  are  directly  related  to  how  well  the  research  objectives
               correspond to the true business “problem.
                       A decision statement is a written expression of the key question(s) that a research

               user wishes to answer. It is the reason that research is being considered. It must be well stated
               and relevant.

               Problem definition
                       The process of defining and developing a decision statement and the steps involved
               in translating it into more precise research terminology, including a set of research

               Problem Complexity
                       Ultimately, the quality of business research in improving business decisions is limited

               by the quality of the problem definition stage. This is far from the easiest stage of the research
               process. Indeed, it can be the most complex.]]></page><page Index="586"><![CDATA[The Problem-Definition Process
                       A problem occurs when there is a difference between the current conditions and a

               more preferable set of conditions. In other words, a gap exists between the way things are
               now and a way that things could be better.
                   1.  Business performance is worse than expected business performance.

                   2.  Actual business performance is less than possible business performance.
                   3.  Expected business performance is greater than possible business performance.


               The Problem-Definition Process Steps
                       The  problem-definition  process  involves  several interrelated  steps.  Sometimes, the

               boundaries between each step aren’t exactly clear. But generally, completing one step leads
               to the other and by the time the problem is defined, each of these steps has been addressed

               in some way. The steps are
               1. Understand the business situation—identify key symptoms
               2. Identify key problem(s) from symptoms

               3. Write managerial decision statement and corresponding research objectives
               4. Determine the unit of analysis
               5. Determine the relevant variables

               6. Write research questions and/or research hypotheses
               The Problem - Definition Process






















               Identifying Symptoms
                       Probing  is  an  interview  technique  that  tries  to  draw  deeper  and  more  elaborate
               explanations from the discussion. This discussion may involve potential problem causes. This

               probing process will likely be very helpful in identifying key variables that are prime candidates
               for study.

                       Often, multiple interviews are necessary to identify all the key symptoms and gain a
               better understanding of the actual business situation.]]></page><page Index="587"><![CDATA[Identifying the Relevant Issues from the Symptoms
                       Anticipating the many influences and dimensions of a problem is impossible for any

               researcher or executive. The preceding interview is extremely useful in translating the decision
               situation into a working problem definition by focusing on symptoms. The probing process
               discussed  on  pages  115–116  begins  this  process.  However,  the  researcher  needs  to  be

               doubly certain that the research attacks real problems and not superficial symptoms.

               Writing Managerial Decision Statements and Corresponding Research Objectives

                       The  situation  analysis  ends  once researchers  have  a  clear  idea of  the managerial
               objectives from the research effort. Decision statements capture these objectives in a way that

               invites multiple solutions. Multiple solutions are encouraged by using plural nouns to describe
               solutions. In other words, a decision statement that says in what “ways” a problem can be
               solved is better than one that says in what “way” a problem can be solved. Ultimately, research

               may provide evidence showing results of several ways a problem can be attacked.


               Translating Decision Statements]]></page><page Index="588"><![CDATA[Write Research Objectives and Questions







































                       Research questions express the research objectives in terms of questions that can

               be addressed by research. For example, one of the key research questions involved in the
               opening vignette is “Are wages and long-haul distance related to driver loyalty and retention?”
               Hypotheses are more specific than research questions. One key distinction between research

               questions  and  hypotheses  is  that  hypotheses  can  generally  specify  the  direction  of  a
               relationship.  In  other  words,  when  an  independent  variable  goes  up,  we  have  sufficient]]></page><page Index="589"><![CDATA[knowledge to predict that the dependent variable should also go up (or down as the case may
               be).


               Clarity in Research Questions and Hypotheses
                       Research questions make it easier to understand what is perplexing managers and to

               indicate what issues have to be resolved. A research question is the researcher’s translation
               of the marketing problem into a specific inquiry.


               The Research Proposal
                       The research proposal is a written statement of the research design. It always includes

               a  statement  explaining  the  purpose  of  the  study  (in  the  form  of  research  objectives  or
               deliverables) and a definition of the problem, often in the form of a decision statement. A good

               proposal systematically outlines the particular research methodology and details procedures
               that will be used during each stage of the research process. Normally a schedule of costs and
               deadlines is included in the research proposal. The research proposal becomes the primary

               communication document between the researcher and the research user.]]></page><page Index="590"><![CDATA[Translate research objectives into research questions and/or research hypotheses.
                       Research questions simply restate the research objectives in the form of a question.

               When the researcher has sufficient theoretical reasoning to make a more specific prediction
               that  includes  the  direction  of  any  predicted  relationship,  the  research  question  can  be
               translated into one or more research hypotheses.


               Outline the components of a research proposal.

                       The  research  proposal  is  a  written  statement  of  the  research  design  that  will  be
               followed in addressing a specific problem. The research proposal allows managers to evaluate
               the details of the proposed research and determine if alterations are needed. Most research

               proposals  include  the  following  sections:  decision  description,  purpose  of  the  research
               including the research objectives, research design, sample design, data gathering and/ or

               fieldwork techniques, data processing and analysis, budget, and time schedule.

               Construct dummy tables as part of a research proposal.

                       Dummy tables are included in research proposals and look exactly like the real tables
               that will be included in the final research report. However, they cannot actually contain results
               since the study has not yet been done. So, they include hypothetical results that look as much

               as possible like the actual results. These tables are a very good tool for communicating the
               value of a research project to management because they provide a real sense for implications
               that may result from the research.





                                           QUALITATIVE RESEARCH TOOLS


               What Is Qualitative Research?
                       Qualitative  business  research  is  research  that  addresses  business  objectives

               through techniques that allow the researcher to provide elaborate interpretations of market
               phenomena without depending on numerical measurement. Its focus is on discovering true
               inner meanings and new insights. Qualitative research is very widely applied in practice. There

               are many research firms that specialize in qualitative research. Qualitative research is less
               structured than most quantitative approaches. It does not rely on self-response questionnaires
               containing structured response formats. Instead, it is more researcher-dependent in that the

               researcher must extract meaning from unstructured responses, such as text from a recorded
               interview or a collage representing the meaning of some experience, such as skateboarding.

               The researcher interprets the data to extract its meaning and converts it to information.]]></page><page Index="591"><![CDATA[Quantitative business research can be defined as business research that addresses
               research objectives through empirical assessments that involve numerical measurement and

               analysis approaches. Qualitative research is more apt to stand on its own in the sense that it
               requires less interpretation.
               Qualitative “versus” Quantitative Research

                       One  can  find  many  debates  about  the  superiority  of  qualitative  research  over
               quantitative research or vice versa.6 We’ll begin by saying that this is largely a superfluous

               argument in either direction. The truth is that qualitative research can accomplish research
               objectives that quantitative research cannot. Similarly, truthful, but no more so, quantitative
               research can accomplish objectives that qualitative research cannot. The key to successfully

               using either is to match the right approach to the right research context.






































               Orientations to Qualitative Research

                       Qualitative  research  can  be  performed  in  many  ways  using  many  techniques.
               Orientations to qualitative research are very much influenced by the different fields of study
               involved in research. These orientations are each associated with a category of qualitative

               research. The major categories of qualitative research include
               1. Phenomenology—originating in philosophy and psychology

               2. Ethnography—originating in anthropology
               3. Grounded theory—originating in sociology
               4. Case studies—originating in psychology and in business research]]></page><page Index="592"><![CDATA[Phenomenology.  A philosophical approach to studying human experiences based

               on the idea that human experience itself is inherently subjective and determined by the context
               in which people live.
                       Ethnography  represents  ways  of  studying  cultures  through  methods  that  involve

               becoming highly active within that culture. Participant-observation typifies an ethnographic
               research approach. Participantobservation means the researcher becomes immersed within

               the culture that he or she is studying and draws data from his or her observations.
                       Grounded  theory  Represents  an  inductive  investigation  in  which  the  researcher
               poses questions about information provided by respondents or taken from historical records;

               the researcher asks the questions to him or herself and repeatedly questions the responses
               to derive deeper explanations.

                       Case studies simply refer to the documented history of a particular person, group,
               organization, or event. Typically, a case study may describe the events of a specific company
               as it faces an important decision or situation, such as introducing a new product or dealing

               with  some  management  crisis.  Textbook  cases  typify  this  kind  of  case  study.  Clinical
               interviews  of  managers,  employees,  or  customers  can  represent  a  case  study.  The  case
               studies can then be analyzed for important themes. Themes are identified by the frequency

               with which the same term (or a synonym) arises in the narrative description. The themes may
               be useful in discovering variables that are relevant to potential explanations.


               Recognize  technological  advances  in  the  application  of  qualitative  research
               approaches.

                       Videoconferencing and online chat rooms are more economical ways of trying to do
               much the same as traditional focus group interviews. Some companies have even established
               a  focus  blog  that  is  a  source  for  continuous  commentary  on  a  company.  While  they  are

               certainly cost advantageous, there is less control over who participates.


               Recognize common qualitative research tools and know the advantages and limitations
               of their use.
                       The most common qualitative research tools include the focus group interview and the

               depth interview. The focus group has some cost advantage per respondent because it would
               take  ten  times  as  long  to  conduct  the  interview  portion(s)  of  a  series  of  depth  interviews
               compared to one focus group. However, the depth interview is more appropriate for discussing

               sensitive topics.]]></page><page Index="593"><![CDATA[SECONDARY DATA RESEARCH IN A DIGITAL AGE


               Advantages of Secondary Data

                       The primary advantage of secondary data is their availability. Obtaining secondary
               data  is  almost  always  faster  and  less  expensive  than  acquiring  primary  data.  This  is
               particularly true when researchers use electronic retrieval to access data stored digitally. In

               many situations, collecting secondary data is instantaneous.
                       Consider the money and time saved by researchers who obtained updated population

               estimates for a town during the interim between the 2000 and 2010 censuses.
                       Secondary data are essential in instances when data cannot be obtained using primary
               data  collection  procedures.  For  example,  a  manufacturer  of  farm  implements  could  not

               duplicate the information in the Census of Agriculture because much of the information there
               (for example, amount of taxes paid) might not be accessible to a private firm.


               Disadvantages of Secondary Data
                       An inherent disadvantage of secondary data is that they were not designed specifically
               to meet the researchers’ needs. Thus, researchers must ask how pertinent the data are to

               their particular project.
                       To evaluate secondary data, researchers should ask questions such as these:

                • Is the subject matter consistent with our problem definition?
               • Do the data apply to the population of interest?
               • Do the data apply to the time period of interest?

               • Do the secondary data appear in the correct units of measurement?
               • Do the data cover the subject of interest in adequate detail?


               Data conversion
                       The process of changing the original form of the data to a format suitable to achieve
               the research objective; also called data transformation


               Write Research Objectives and Questions

                       Both  managers  and  researchers  expect  problem-definition  efforts  to  result  in
               statements of research questions and research objectives. At the end of the problem-definition
               stage, the researcher should prepare a written statement that clarifies any ambiguity about

               what the research hopes to accomplish. This completes the translation process.]]></page><page Index="594"><![CDATA[Research questions express the research objectives in terms of questions that can

               faced by management, the more resources should be allocated toward problem definition.

               While not a guarantee, allowing more time and spending more money will help make sure the
               research  objectives  that  result  are  relevant  and  can  demonstrate  which  influences

               management should focus on.

               The Proposal as a Planning Tool

                       Preparation of a research proposal forces the researcher to think critically about each
               stage of the research process. Vague plans, abstract ideas, and sweeping generalizations

               about problems or procedures must become concrete and precise statements about specific
               events. Data requirements and research procedures must be specified clearly so others may
               understand their exact implications. All ambiguities about why and how the research will be

               conducted must be clarified before the proposal is complete.

               The Proposal as a Contract

                       When the research will be conducted by a consultant or an outside research supplier,
               the written proposal serves as that person’s bid to offer a specific service. Typically, a client
               solicits several competitive proposals, and these written offers help management judge the

               relative  quality  of  alternative  research  suppliers.  A  wise researcher  will  not  agree to  do  a
               research job for which no written proposal exists. The proposal also serves as a contract that

               describes the product the research user will buy.
                       Funded business research refers to basic research usually performed by academic
               researchers that is financially supported by some public or private institution, as in federal

               government grants.


               Anticipating Outcomes
                       The proposal and the final research report will contain much of the same information.
               The proposal describes the data collection, measurement, data analysis, and so forth, in future

               tense. In the report, the actual results are presented. In this sense, the proposal anticipates
               the research outcome. Experienced researchers know that research fails more often because
               the  problem-definition  process  breaks  down  or  because  the  research  client  never  truly

               understood what a research project could or couldn’t do. While it probably seems as though
               the  proposal  should  make this  clear,  any  shortcoming  in the  proposal  can  contribute to  a]]></page><page Index="596"><![CDATA[communication failure. Thus, any tool that helps communication become as clear as can be

                                         SURVEY RESEARCH: AN OVERVIEW
               Introduction

                       The purpose of survey research is to collect primary data—data gathered from the
               respondents and assembled specifically for the project at hand.
                   Respondents  -  People  who  verbally  answer  an  interviewer’s  questions  or  provide

               answers to written questions.
                   Sample Survey – a more formal term, which emphasizes that the purpose of contacting
               respondents is to obtain a representative sample, or subset, of the target population.


               Using Surveys

                       The type of information gathered in a survey varies considerably depending on its
               objectives. Typically, surveys attempt to describe what is happening or to learn the reasons
               for a particular business activity.

                       Identifying  characteristics  of  target  markets,  measuring  customer  attitudes,  and
               describing consumer purchase patterns are all common business research objectives. Most

               business surveys have multiple objectives; few gather only a single type of factual information.
               Although consumer surveys are a common form of business research, not all survey research
               is conducted with the ultimate consumer. Frequently, studies focus on wholesalers, retailers,

               industrial buyers, or within the organization itself. For example, a survey could be used to
               determine an organization’s commitment to the environment. Also, measuring employee job
               satisfaction and describing the risk aversion of financial investors may be important survey

               objectives.
                       Because most survey research is descriptive research, the term survey is most often
               associated with quantitative findings. Although most surveys are conducted to quantify certain]]></page><page Index="598"><![CDATA[factual  information,  some  aspects  of  surveys  may  also  be  qualitative.  In  new-product
               development, a survey often has a qualitative objective of refining product concepts. Stylistic,

               aesthetic, or functional changes may be made on the basis of respondents’ suggestions. In
               our example of an organization’s environmental attitudes, a survey might be used to gather
               qualitative information regarding activities that could make the company more “green”.


               Advantages of Surveys

                       Surveys  provide  a  quick,  inexpensive,  efficient,  and  accurate  means  of  assessing
               information about a population. The examples given earlier illustrate that surveys are quite
               flexible and, when properly conducted, extremely valuable to the manager. The growth of

               survey research is related to the simple idea that to find out what someone thinks, you need
               to ask them.

                       However,  they  can  also  be  used  poorly  when  researchers  do  not  follow  research
               principles, such as careful survey and sample design. Sometimes even a welldesigned and
               carefully executed survey is not helpful because the results are delivered too late to inform

               decisions.

               Errors in Survey Research]]></page><page Index="599"><![CDATA[A manager who is evaluating the quality of a survey must estimate its accuracy. They
               have two major sources: random sampling error and systematic error (as shown in the figure

               below).
               Random Sampling Error - A statistical fluctuation that occurs because of chance variation in
               the elements selected for a sample.

               Systematic Error - Error resulting from some imperfect aspect of the research design that
               causes respondent error or from a mistake in the execution of the research.

                       Sample Bias - A persistent tendency for the results of a sample to deviate in one
               direction from the true value of the population parameter.
                       The many sources of error that in some way systematically influence answers can be

               divided into two general categories: respondent error and administrative error.
               Respondent Error - A category of sample bias resulting from some respondent action or

               inaction such as nonresponse or response bias.
                 • Nonresponse Error - The statistical differences between a survey that includes only those
                   who responded and a perfect survey that would also include those who failed to respond.

                       Non Respondents - People who are not contacted or who refuse to cooperate in the
               research.

                          ▪  No Contacts - People who are not at home or who are otherwise inaccessible
                              on the first and second contact.
                          ▪  Refusals - People who are unwilling to participate in a research project.

                          ▪  Self-Selection Bias - A bias that occurs because people who feel strongly
                              about a subject are more likely to respond to survey questions than people who
                              feel indifferent about it.

                 • Response  Bias  -  A  bias  that  occurs  when  respondents  either  consciously  or
                   unconsciously tend to answer questions with a certain slant that misrepresents the truth.
                       Deliberate  Falsification  -  A  response  bias  may  occur  when  people  misrepresent

                       answers  to  appear  intelligent,  conceal  personal information,  avoid  embarrassment,
                       and so on.

                       Unconscious Misrepresentation - Even when a respondent is consciously trying to
                       be truthful and cooperative, response bias can arise from the question format, the
                       question content, or some other stimulus.

                     Type of Response Bias
                          ▪  Acquiescence Bias - A tendency for respondents to agree with all or most

                              questions asked of them in a survey.
                          ▪  Extremity  Bias  -  A  category  of  response  bias  that  results  because  some
                              individuals tend to use extremes when responding to questions.]]></page><page Index="600"><![CDATA[▪  Interviewer Bias - A response bias that occurs because the presence of the
                              interviewer influences respondents’ answers.

                          ▪  Social Desirability Bias - Bias in responses caused by respondents’ desire,
                              either conscious or unconscious, to gain prestige or appear in a different social
                              role.

               Administrative Error - An error caused by the improper administration or execution of the
               research task.

                 • Data-Processing  Error  -  A  category  of  administrative  error  that  occurs  because  of
                   incorrect data entry, incorrect computer programming, or other procedural errors during
                   data analysis.

                 • Sample Selection Error - An administrative error caused by improper sample design or
                   sampling procedure execution.

                 • interviewer  error - Mistakes  made  by  interviewers  failing  to record  survey  responses
                   correctly.

                 • interviewer cheating - The practice of filling in fake answers or falsifying questionnaires
                   while working as an interviewer.


               Rule-of-Thumb Estimates for Systematic Error
                       Researchers have established conservative rules of thumb based on experience to
               estimate systematic error. In the case of consumer research, experienced researchers might

               determine that only a certain percentage of people who say they will definitely buy a new
               product  actually  do  so.  Evidence  for  a  mere-measurement  effect  suggests  that  in  some

               situations, researchers might conclude that respondents’ own buying behavior will exaggerate
               overall sales. Thus, researchers often present actual survey findings and their interpretations
               of estimated purchase response based on estimates of non-sampling error.

                       For example, one pay-per-view cable TV company surveys geographic areas it plans
               to enter and estimates the number of people who indicate they will subscribe to its service.

               The company knocks down the percentage by a “ballpark 10 percent” because experience in
               other geographic areas has indicated that there is a systematic upward bias of 10 percent on
               this intentions question.


               Classifying Survey Research Methods
                       Surveys may be classified based on the method of communication, the degrees of

               structure and disguise in the questionnaire, and the time frame in which the data are gathered
               (temporal classification).
                   Structured/Unstructured and Disguised/Undisguised Questionnaires]]></page><page Index="601"><![CDATA[•  Structured Question - A question that imposes a limit on the number of allowable

                          responses.
                       •  Unstructured  Question  -  A  question  that  does  not  restrict  the  respondents’
                          answers.

                       •  Undisguised Questions - Straightforward questions that assume the respondent
                          is willing to answer.

                       •  Disguised Questions - Indirect questions that assume the purpose of the study
                          must be hidden from the respondent.
                   Temporal Classification

                       •  Cross-Sectional Study - A study in which various segments of a population are
                          sampled and data are collected at a single moment in time.

                       •  Longitudinal Study - A survey of respondents at different times, thus allowing
                          analysis of response continuity and changes over time.
                              ▪  Tracking Study - A type of longitudinal study that uses successive samples

                                 to  compare  trends  and  identify  changes  in  variables  such  as  consumer
                                 satisfaction, brand image, or advertising awareness.

                              ▪  Consumer Panel - A longitudinal survey of the same sample of individuals
                                 or households to record their attitudes, behavior, or purchasing habits over
                                 time.




                           SURVEY RESEARCH: COMMUNICATING WITH RESPONDENTS
               Introduction

                       During most of the twentieth century, obtaining survey data involved inviting individuals
               to  answer  questions  asked  by  human  interviewers  (interviews)  or  questions  they  read
               themselves  (questionnaires).  Interviewers  communicated  with  respondents  face-to-face  or

               over the telephone, or respondents filled out self-administered paper questionnaires, which
               were typically distributed by mail. These media for conducting surveys remain popular with

               business researchers. However, digital technology is having a profound impact on society in
               general and on business research in particular. Its greatest impact is in the creation of new
               forms of communications media.


               Interviews as Interactive Communication

                       When two people engage in a conversation, human interaction takes place. Human
               interactive media are a personal form of communication. One human being directs a message
               to  and  interacts  with  another  individual  (or  a  small  group).  When  most  people  think  of]]></page><page Index="602"><![CDATA[interviewing, they envision two people engaged in a face-to-face dialogue or a conversation
               on the telephone. Electronic interactive media allow researchers to reach a large audience,

               personalize individual messages, and interact using digital technology.
               Non-interactive Media
                       The traditional questionnaire received by mail and completed by the respondent does

               not allow a dialogue or an exchange of information providing immediate feedback. So, from
               our perspective, self-administered questionnaires printed on paper are noninteractive. This

               fact does not mean that they are without merit, just that this type of survey is less flexible than
               surveys using interactive communication media.


               ▪  Personal Interviews
                       Face-to-face  communication  in  which  an  interviewer  asks  a  respondent  to  answer

               questions.

                   ➢  Callbacks  -  Attempts to  recontact  individuals  selected for  a  sample  who  were  not
                       available initially.

                   ➢  Mall Intercept Interviews - Personal interviews conducted in a shopping mall.

               ▪  Telephone Interviews

                       Personal  interviews  conducted  by  telephone,  the  mainstay  of  commercial  survey
               research.

                 • Mobile Phone Interviews  - Mobile phone interviews differ from landline phones most
                   obviously because they are directed toward a mobile (i.e., cell) phone number. However,

                       control the quality of interviewing more effectively.

                   ➢  Computer-Assisted  Telephone  Interviewing  (CATI)  -  Technology  that  allows
                       answers to telephone interviews to be entered directly into a computer for processing.
                   ➢  Computerized  Voice-Activated  Telephone  Interview  -  Technological  advances

                       have  combined  computerized  telephone  dialing  and  voice-activated  computer
                       messages  to  allow  researchers  to  conduct  telephone  interviews  without  human
                       interviewers.  However,  researchers  have  found  that  computerized  voice-activated

                       telephone interviewing works best with very short, simple questionnaires.

               ▪  Self-Administered  Questionnaires  -  Surveys  in  which  the  respondent  takes  the

                   responsibility for reading and answering the questions.




















                   ▪  Mail Survey - A self-administered questionnaire sent to respondents through the

                       mail.
                   ▪  Drop-Off Method - A survey method that requires the interviewer to travel to the

                 “The capacity to learn is a gift; the ability to learn is a skill; the willingness to learn is a choice.”

                Chapter Learning Outcomes

                By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:
                1. distinguish levels of scale measurement

                2. identify basic approaches to measuring attitudes
                3. define alternatives for wording open-ended and fixed alternative questions



                                      MEASUREMENT AND SCALING CONCEPTS
               What Do I Measure
                       Measurement is the process of describing some property of a phenomenon of interest,

               usually by assigning numbers in a reliable and valid way.
                       A  concept  can  be  thought  of  as  a  generalized  idea  that  represents  something  of
               meaning.  Concepts  such  as  age,  sex,  education,  and  number  of  children  are  relatively

               concrete properties. They present few problems in either definition or measurement. Other
               concepts  are  more  abstract.  Concepts  such  as  loyalty,  personality,  channel  power,  trust,

               corporate culture, customer satisfaction, value, and so on are more difficult to both define and
               measure.
                       For example, loyalty has been measured as a combination of customer share (the

               relative  proportion  of  a  person’s  purchases  going  to  one  competing  brand/store)  and
               commitment (the degree to which a customer will sacrifice to do business with a brand/store).1

               Thus,  we  can see that  loyalty consists  of  two  components,  the first  is behavioral  and  the
               second is attitudinal.
                       Operationalization - The process of identifying scales that correspond to variance in

               a concept to be involved in a research process.
                       Scales - A device providing a range of values that correspond to different values in a
               concept being measured.

                       Correspondence Rules - Indicate the way that a certain value on a scale corresponds
               to some true value of a concept
                       Construct - A term used to refer to concepts measured with multiple variables.]]></page><page Index="607"><![CDATA[Levels of Scale Measurement
                       The four levels or types of scale measurement are:

               1. nominal
               2. ordinal
               3. interval

               4. ratio
                       This four types of scale measurement provide different information.







































                       Nominal  scales  represent  the  most  elementary  level  of  measurement.  A  nominal
               scale assigns a value to an object for identification or classification purposes only. The value

               can be, but does not have to be, a number because no quantities are being represented. In
               this sense, a nominal scale is truly a qualitative scale. Nominal scales are extremely useful,
               and  are  sometimes  the  only  appropriate  measure,  even  though  they  can  be  considered

               elementary.
                       Ordinal scales allow things to be arranged in order based on how much of some

               concept they possess. In other words, an ordinal scale is a ranking scale. In fact, we often use
               the term rank order to describe an ordinal scale. When class rank for high school students is
               determined, we have used an ordinal scale. We know that the student ranked seventh finished

               ahead of the student ranked eighth, who finished ahead of the ninth ranked student. However,
               we do not really know what the actual GPA was or how close these three students are to each
               other in overall grade point average.]]></page><page Index="608"><![CDATA[Interval  scales  have  both  nominal  and  ordinal  properties,  but  they  also  capture
               information about differences in quantities of a concept. So, not only would a sales manager

               know  that  a  particular  salesperson  outperformed  a  colleague,  information  that  would  be
               available with an ordinal measure, but the manager would know by how much. If a professor
               assigns grades to term papers using a numbering system ranging from 1.0–20.0, not only

               does the scale represent the fact that a student with a 16.0 outperformed a student with 12.0,
               but the scale would show by how much (4.0).

                       Ratio scales represent the highest form of measurement in that they have all the
               properties of interval scales with the additional attribute of representing absolute quantities.
               Interval  scales  possess  only  relative  meaning,  whereas  ratio  scales  represent  absolute

               meaning. In other words, ratio scales provide iconic measurement.]]></page><page Index="609"><![CDATA[Mathematical and Statistical Analysis of Scale

                   •  Discrete Measure are those that take on only one of a finite number of values. A
               discrete scale is most often used to represent a classification variable. Therefore, discrete
               scales do not represent intensity of measures, only membership. Common discrete scales

               include any yes-or-no response, matching, color choices, or practically any scale that involves
               selecting from among a small number of categories. Thus, when someone is asked to choose
               from the following responses • Disagree • Neutral • Agree

                   •  Continuous measures are those assigning values anywhere along some scale range
               in a place that corresponds to the intensity of some concept. Ratio measures are continuous

               measures. Thus, when Griff measures sales for each salesperson using the dollar amount
               sold, he is assigning a continuous measure. A number line could be constructed ranging from
               the  least  amount sold  to  the  most,  and  a  spot on  the  line  would  correspond  exactly to  a

               salesperson’s performance. Strictly speaking, interval scales are not necessarily continuous.
               Consider the following common type of survey question:









               Indexes and Composite Measures
                       Attribute - A single characteristic or fundamental feature of an object, person,

               situation, or issue.
                       Index measure - An index assigns a value based on how much of the concept being
               measured is associated with an observation. Indexes often are formed by putting several

               variables together.
                       Composite measures - Assign a value to an observation based on a mathematical
               derivation of multiple variables.


               Computing Scale Values
                       Summated Scale - A scale created by simply summing (adding together) the

               response to each item making up the composite measure.]]></page><page Index="610"><![CDATA[Reverse coding means that the value assigned for a response is treated oppositely

               from the other items. Thus, on a 5-point scale, the values are reversed as follows:
               • 5 becomes 1

               • 4 becomes 2
               • 3 stays 3
               • 2 becomes 4

               • 1 becomes 5




                                              ATTITUDE MEASUREMENT
               Introduction

                       For social scientists, an attitude is as an enduring disposition to respond consistently
               to specific aspects of the world, including actions, people, or objects. One way to understand
               an attitude is to break it down into its components.


               Attitude as Hypothetical Constructs
                       Hypothetical  Constructs  -  Variables  that  are  not  directly  observable  but  are

               measurable through indirect indicators, such as verbal expression or overt behavior.


               Importance of Measuring Attitude
                       Most  managers  hold  the  intuitive  belief  that  changing  consumers’  or  employees’
               attitudes  toward  their  company  or  their  company’s  products  or  services  is  a  major  goal.]]></page><page Index="611"><![CDATA[Because modifying attitudes plays a pervasive role in developing strategies to address these
               goals, the measurement of attitudes is an important task.


               Techniques for Measuring Attitude

                   •  Ranking A measurement task that requires respondents to rank order a small number
               of stores, brands, or objects on the basis of overall preference or some characteristic of the
               stimulus.

                   •  Rating - A measurement task that requires respondents to estimate the magnitude of
               a characteristic or quality that a brand, store, or object possesses.

                   •  Sorting  -  A  measurement  task that  presents  a respondent  with  several  objects  or
               product concepts and requires the respondent to arrange the objects into piles or classify the
               product concepts.

                   •  Choice - A measurement task that identifies preferences by requiring respondents to
               choose between two or more alternatives.


               Attitude Rating Scales

                   •  Simple Attitude Scales
                       In its most basic form, attitude scaling requires that an individual agree or disagree
               with a statement or respond to a single question. For example, respondents in a political poll

               may be asked whether they agree or disagree with the statement “The president should run
               for re-election.” Or, an individual might indicate whether he or she likes or dislikes jalapeño
               bean dip.

                   •  Category Scales
                       A  rating  scale  that  consists  of  several  response  categories,  often  providing
               respondents with alternatives to indicate positions on a continuum.











                   •  Likert scale
                       A measure of attitudes designed to allow respondents to rate how strongly they agree

               or disagree with carefully constructed statements, ranging from very positive to very negative
               attitudes toward some object.]]></page><page Index="612"><![CDATA[Selected Category Scale














































                   •  Numerical Scale An attitude rating scale similar to a semantic differential except that

               it  uses  numbers,  instead  of  verbal  descriptions,  as  response  options  to  identify  response
               positions. Consider the following numerical scale:
               Now that you’ve had your automobile for about one year, please tell us how satisfied you are

               with your Ford Taurus.
                             Extremely Dissatisfied   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   Extremely Satisfied

                   •  Constant-Sum Scale - A measure of attitudes in which respondents are asked to
               divide a constant sum to indicate the relative importance of attributes; respondents often sort
               cards, but the task may also be a rating task.

               Divide 100 points among the following brands according to your preference for each brand:]]></page><page Index="613"><![CDATA[____ Brand A
               ____ Brand B

               Ranking
                       Paired  Comparison  -  A  measurement  technique  that  involves  presenting  the

               respondent with two objects and asking the respondent to pick the preferred object; more than
               two objects may be presented, but comparisons are made in pairs.
                       The  following  question  illustrates  the  typical  format  for  asking  about  paired

               comparisons. I would like to know your overall opinion of two brands of adhesive bandages.
               They are Curad and BandAid. Overall, which of these two brands—Curad or Band-Aid—do

               you think is the better one? Or are both the same
                       Curad is better.
                       Band-Aid is better.

                       They are the same.

               Sorting

                       Sorting tasks ask respondents to indicate their attitudes or beliefs by arranging items
               on the basis of perceived similarity or some other attribute. In an airline study of customer
               preferences, the following sorting technique could be used:

               Here is a sheet that lists several airlines. Next to the name of each airline is a pocket. Here
               are ten cards. I would like you to put these cards in the pockets next to the airlines you would

               prefer to fly on your next trip. Assume that all of the airlines fly to wherever you would choose
               to travel. You can put as many cards as you want next to an airline, or you can put no cards
               next to an airline.

                                            Cards
               American Airlines            ___

               Delta Airlines               ___
               United Airlines              ___
               Southwest Airlines           ___

               Northwest Airlines           ___

               Ranking, Sorting, Rating, or Choice Technique?

                       The  decision  whether  to  use  ranking,  sorting,  rating,  or  a  choice  technique  is
               determined largely by the problem definition and especially by the type of statistical analysis]]></page><page Index="614"><![CDATA[desired. For example, ranking provides only ordinal data, limiting the statistical techniques that

                                               QUESTIONNAIRE DESIGN
               Introduction

                       Each stage in the business research process is important and interdependent. The
               research questionnaire development stage is critically important as the information provided

               is only as good as the questions asked. However, the importance of question wording is
               easily, and far too often, overlooked.


               Questionnaire Quality and Design: Basic Considerations
                       For a questionnaire to fulfill a researcher’s purposes, the questions must meet the
               basic  criteria  of  relevance  and  accuracy.  To  achieve  these  ends,  a  researcher  who  is

               systematically planning a questionnaire’s design will be required to make several decisions—
               typically, but not necessarily, in the following order:
                   1.  What should be asked?

                   2.  How should questions be phrased?
                   3.  In what sequence should the questions be arranged?

                   4.  What questionnaire layout will best serve the research objectives?
                   5.  How should the questionnaire be pretested? Does the questionnaire need to be
               revised?


               Questionnaire Relevancy

                       A questionnaire is relevant to the extent that all information collected addresses a
               research question that will help the decision maker address the current business problem.
               Asking a wrong question or an irrelevant question is a common pitfall.

               Questionnaire Accuracy
                       Once a researcher decides what should be asked, the criterion of accuracy becomes
               the  primary  concern.  Accuracy  means  that  the  information  is  reliable  and  valid.  While

               experienced  researchers  generally  believe  that  questionnaires  should  use  simple,
               understandable, unbiased, unambiguous, and nonirritating words, no step-by-step procedure
               for ensuring accuracy in question writing can be generalized across projects.

                            TYPES OF SAMPLING DESIGN IN RESEARCH METHODOLOGY

               Introduction

                       There are different types of sample designs based on two factors, the representation
               basis and the element selection technique. On the representation basis, the sample may be
               probability sampling or it may be non-probability sampling.

                       Probability sampling is based on the concept of random selection, whereas non-
               probability sampling is ‘non-random’ sampling. On element selection basis, the sample may
               be either unrestricted or restricted.

                       When each sample element is drawn individually from the population at large, then the
               sample so drawn is known as ‘unrestricted sample’, whereas all other forms of sampling are

               covered under the term ‘restricted sampling’. The following chart exhibits the sample designs
               as explained above.]]></page><page Index="621"><![CDATA[Chart Showing Basic Sampling Designs

















                       Non-probability  sampling: Non-probability  sampling  is  that  sampling  procedure
               which does not afford any basis for estimating the probability that each item in the population

               has  of  being  included  in  the  sample.  Non-probability  sampling  is  also  known  by  different
               names such as deliberate sampling, purposive sampling and judgement sampling. In this type
               of  sampling,  items  for  the  sample  are  selected  deliberately  by  the  researcher;  his  choice

               concerning the items remains supreme. In other words, under non-probability sampling the
               organizers of the inquiry purposively choose the particular units of the universe for constituting

               a sample on the basis that the small mass that they so select out of a huge one will be typical
               or representative of the whole. For instance, if economic conditions of people living in a state
               are to be studied, a few towns and villages may be purposively selected for intensive study on

               the principle that they can be representative of the entire state. Thus, the judgement of the
               organizers of the study plays an important part in this sampling design.

                       Probability sampling: Probability sampling is also known as ‘random sampling’ or
               ‘chance  sampling’.  Under  this  sampling  design,  every  item  of  the  universe  has  an  equal
               chance of inclusion in the sample. It is, so to say, a lottery method in which individual units are

               picked up from the whole group not deliberately but by some mechanical process. Here it is
               blind chance alone that determines whether one item or the other is selected. The results
               obtained from probability or random sampling can be assured in terms of probability i.e., we

               can measure the errors of estimation or the significance of results obtained from a random
               sample, and this fact brings out the superiority of random sampling design over the deliberate
               sampling design. Random sampling ensures the law of Statistical Regularity which states that

               if  on  an  average  the  sample  chosen  is  a  random  one,  the  sample  will  have  the  same
               composition and characteristics as the universe. This is the reason why random sampling is

               considered  as the  best technique  of selecting  a  representative  sample. In  such  a  design,
               personal  element  has  a  great  chance  of  entering  into  the  selection  of  the  sample.  The
               investigator may select a sample which shall yield results favorable to his point of view and if

               that happens, the entire inquiry may get vitiated. Thus, there is always the danger of bias
               entering  into  this  type  of  sampling  technique.  But  in  the  investigators  are  impartial,  work]]></page><page Index="622"><![CDATA[without bias and have the necessary experience so as to take sound judgement, the results
               obtained from an analysis of deliberately selected sample may be tolerably reliable. However,

               in such a sampling, there is no assurance that every element has some specifiable chance of
               being included. Sampling error in this type of sampling cannot be estimated and the element
               of bias, great or small, is always there. As such this sampling design in rarely adopted in large

               inquires of importance. However, in small inquiries and researches by individuals, this design
               may be adopted because of the relative advantage of time and money inherent in this method

               of  sampling. Quota sampling is  also  an  example  of  non-probability  sampling.  Under  quota
               sampling the interviewers are simply given quotas to be filled from the different strata, with
               some restrictions on how they are to be filled. In other words, the actual selection of the items

               for the sample is left to the interviewer’s discretion. This type of sampling is very convenient
               and  is  relatively  inexpensive.  But  the  samples  so  selected  certainly  do  not  possess  the

               characteristic  of  random  samples. Quota samples  are  essentially  judgement  samples  and
               inferences drawn on their basis are not amenable to statistical treatment in a formal way.


               What is Sample design in Research Methodology?
               A sample design is made up of two elements. Random sampling from a finite population refers
               to that method of sample selection which gives each possible sample combination an equal

               probability of being picked up and each item in the entire population to have an equal chance
               of being included in the sample. This applies to sampling without replacement i.e., once an
               item  is  selected  for  the  sample,  it  cannot  appear  in  the  sample  again  (Sampling  with

               replacement is used less frequently in which procedure the element selected for the sample
               is returned to the population before the next element is selected. In such a situation the same

               element could appear twice in the same sample before the second element is chosen). In
               brief, the implications of random sampling (or simple random sampling) are:
                   •  It gives each element in the population an equal probability of getting into the sample;

                       and all choices are independent of one another.
                   •  It gives each possible sample combination an equal probability of being chosen.

               Keeping this in view we can define a simple random sample (or simply a random sample) from
               a finite population as a sample which is chosen in such a way that each of the NCn possible
               samples has the same probability, 1/NCn, of being selected. To make it more clear we take a

               certain finite population consisting of six elements (say a, b, c, d, e, f ) i.e., N = 6. Suppose
               that we want to take a sample of size n = 3 from it. Then there are 6C3 = 20 possible distinct
               samples       of    the      required     size,    and      they     consist     of     the

               elements abc, abd, abe, abf, acd, ace, acf, ade, adf, aef, bcd, bce, bcf, bde, bdf, bef, cde, cd
               f, cef, and def. If we choose one of these samples in such a way that each has the probability
               1/20 of being chosen, we will then call this a random sample.]]></page><page Index="623"><![CDATA[Features of good sampling

               The features of good sampling are stated below:
                   •  Sample design must result in a truly representative sample.
                   •  Sample design must be such which results in a small sampling error.

                   •  Sample design must be viable in the context of funds available for the research study.
                   •  Sample design must be such so that systematic bias can be controlled in a better way.

                   •  Sample should be such that the results of the sample study can be applied, in general,
                       for the universe with a reasonable level of confidence.


               Steps in Sampling Design in Research Methodology
               What points should be taken into consideration by a research in developing a Sample design?

               While developing a sampling design, the researcher must pay attention to the following points:
                   1.  Type of universe: The first step in developing any sample design is to clearly define
                       the set of objects, technically called the Universe, to be studied. The universe can be

                       finite or infinite. In finite universe the number of items is certain, but in case of an infinite
                       universe the number of items is infinite, i.e., we cannot have any idea about the total
                       number of items. The population of a city, the number of workers in a factory and the

                       like are examples of finite universes, whereas the number of stars in the sky, listeners
                       of a specific radio program, throwing of a dice etc. are examples of infinite universes.
                   2.  Sampling unit: A decision has to be taken concerning a sampling unit before selecting

                       sample. Sampling unit may be a geographical one such as state, district, village, etc.,
                       or a construction unit such as house, flat, etc., or it may be a social unit such as family,

                       club, school, etc., or it may be an individual. The researcher will have to decide one or
                       more of such units that he has to select for his study.
                   3.  Source list: It is also known as ‘sampling frame’ from which sample is to be drawn. It

                       contains the names of all items of a universe (in case of finite universe only). If source
                       list is not available, researcher has to prepare it. Such a list should be comprehensive,

                       correct, reliable and appropriate. It is extremely important for the source list to be as
                       representative of the population as possible.
                   4.  Size of sample: This refers to the number of items to be selected from the universe to

                       constitute a sample. This a major problem before a researcher. The size of sample
                       should neither be excessively large, nor too small. It should be optimum. An optimum
                       sample  is  one  which  fulfills  the  requirements  of  efficiency,  representativeness,

                       reliability and flexibility. While deciding the size of sample, researcher must determine
                       the desired precision as also an acceptable confidence level for the estimate. The size
                       of population variance needs to be considered as in case of larger variance usually a]]></page><page Index="624"><![CDATA[bigger sample is needed. The size of population must be kept in view for this also limits
                       the sample size. The parameters of interest in a research study must be kept in view,

                       while deciding the size of the sample. Costs too dictate the size of sample that we can
                       draw. As such, budgetary constraint must invariably be taken into consideration when
                       we decide the sample size.

                   5.  Parameters of interest: In determining the sample design, one must consider the
                       question of the specific population parameters which are of interest. For instance, we

                       may be interested in estimating the proportion of persons with some characteristic in
                       the population, or we may be interested in knowing some average or the other measure
                       concerning the population. There may also be important sub-groups in the population

                       about whom we would like to make estimates. All this has a strong impact upon the
                       sample design we would accept.

                   6.  Budgetary constraint: Cost considerations, from practical point of view, have a major
                       impact upon decisions relating to not only the size of the sample but also to the type
                       of sample. This fact can even lead to the use of a non-probability sample.

                   7.  Sampling procedure: Finally, the researcher must decide the type of sample he will
                       use i.e., he must decide about the technique to be used in selecting the items for the
                       sample. In fact, this technique or procedure stands for the sample design itself. There

                       are  several  sample  designs  (explained  in  the  pages  that  follow)  out  of  which  the
                       researcher must choose one for his study. Obviously, he must select that design which,
                       for a given sample size and for a given cost, has a smaller sampling error.

               Data Collection Methods: Qualitative vs Quantitative Research

                       Data  collection  is  the  process  of  collecting  and  measuring  information  on  specific
               variables. It’s done with the purpose of answering questions or testing hypotheses. There are

               a variety of different data collection methods that researchers can use to gather data. While
               every method has its advantages and drawbacks, some methods are better suited for certain
               situations than others.

               1. Decide what information you need

                       The first step to collecting data is deciding what information you need. You’ll need to
               figure out what topics you’re interested in and who you’ll collect the data from. Additionally,
               you’ll need to decide how much data you need and set a goal for what you want to accomplish

               by collecting and using your data.


               2. Set a time frame
                       You  should  set  a  time  frame  for  collecting  data.  Some  types  of  data  need  to  be
               collected continuously. Others might only need to be tracked and collected over a defined

               period.
                       If you’re looking to collect data over a defined period, you’ll need to set a specific start

               and end time.]]></page><page Index="626"><![CDATA[3. Choose a data collection method
                       It’s crucial that you pick the right method for collecting data. Since data collection is

               costly, you can’t afford to be haphazard about it. Choosing the right data collection method
               will  ensure  that  you’ll  collect  relevant,  high-quality  data.  When  selecting  a  data  collection
               method, you’ll need to take into account the type of information you’re looking to collect, as

               well as the time frame over which you’re going to collect it.


               4. Collect data
                       Once you’ve settled on a particular method of data collection, use it to collect data.
               Find an efficient way to store all the data and make sure to regularly check on how your data

               collection process is working. In the case that conditions change during data collection, you’ll
               need to make appropriate updates to your method of collecting data.


               Deciding between qualitative vs quantitative research
                       Whether you’ll go use qualitative or quantitative research to collect data will depend on

               your specific needs. What kind of question are you looking to get answered? What resources
               do you have at your disposal? Do you have access to a sufficient number of respondents?
               These factors will determine the type of research you’re going to use. Note that quantitative

               and qualitative research methods don’t conflict with each other. In fact, they’re best used in
               combination.  Start  by  using  qualitative  research  to  discover  a  particular  problem  or
               opportunity. Devise a hypothesis (or multiple hypotheses) and then use quantitative research

               to test them.


               Data collection methods
                   1.  Face-to-face interviews
                       Face-to-face  interviews  are  the  most  common  data  collection  method  used  in

                   qualitative  research.  In  face-to-face  interviews,  researchers  collect  data  directly  from
                   subjects through one-on-one interaction. This type of data collection is personal and highly

                   personalized.
                       The interview itself is usually unstructured and informal. Most questions used in the
                   interview are spontaneous and unplanned. They’re focused on getting an understanding

                   of an individual’s perspectives and experiences. They can reveal respondents’ feelings,
                   values, and beliefs. This type of approach is useful for getting a detailed understanding of
                   the subject matter. However, it makes processing the collected data time-consuming and

                   somewhat difficult.]]></page><page Index="627"><![CDATA[2.  Qualitative questionnaires
                          Qualitative questionnaires usually consist of short, open-ended questions. There

                   are no predefined answers offered in these types of questionnaires. Instead, respondents
                   are asked to provide detailed answers in their own words. This gives respondents much

                   more flexibility and freedom in expressing their own opinions.
                          Questionnaires  are  highly  useful  for  gathering  data  from  a  large  number  of
                   respondents. Online  questionnaires,  in  particular, make  data  collection very  quick  and

                   easy. Data collected from qualitative questionnaires can be difficult to analyze because
                   there  are  no  standard  answer  options.  You  also  need  to  pay  special  attention  to  the

                   number of questions you’re going to include. Open-ended questions can be very time-
                   consuming to answer. This makes it crucial that you don’t use too many questions in your
                   survey and overwhelm respondents.



















                   3.  Focus groups

                          Collecting data through focus groups is similar to conducting interviews, except it’s
                   done in a group setting. A focus group needs to consist of a moderator and at least three
                   people. At a maximum, it should include ten people. All group members need to have

                   something in common that’s related to the data you’re looking to gather.
                          When collecting data through focus groups, you’ll need a moderator that will start
                   a discussion on a particular topic. Group members can then state their opinions on it as

                   well as debate each other. The success of focus group data collection depends heavily on]]></page><page Index="628"><![CDATA[the moderator’s capability to guide the discussion and control interactions within the group.
                   The  nature  the  method  allows  researchers  to  get  detailed  and  descriptive  data  on  a

                   particular topic.






















                   4.  Observation
                              Observation  allows  researchers  to  collect  qualitative  data  by  observing
                       respondents in their natural setting. In qualitative observation, researchers participate

                       in the process. They immerse themselves in the setting along with respondents, all
                       while taking notes.
                       The two main types of observation include:

                          •  Covert observation – This type of observation involves the researcher being
                              concealed during the observation process.

                          •  Overt  observation –  Respondents  that  participate  in  overt  observation  are
                              aware that they’re being observed.


                              Data  collected  through  qualitative  observation  is  more  reliable  since
                       researchers  are  participating  in  the  process  themselves.  However,  the  attitude  of

                       researchers towards the data may be subjective.
                              There’s also the issue of researchers’ participation interfering with the natural
                       state  of  the  setting.  Respondents  might  act  differently  because  they  are  being

                       observed which leads to impaired results.
                   5.  Longitudinal studies

                              A longitudinal study is a type of data collection that’s performed repeatedly over
                       an extended period on the same data sources. It can last for years or even decades.
                       It’s used to uncover correlations through an observational or empirical study of subjects

                       that share a common characteristic or trait. Longitudinal studies are ideal for gathering
                       data that’s supposed to establish a pattern for a specific variable over a defined period.]]></page><page Index="629"><![CDATA[They’re  very  effective  in  finding  relationships  of  cause  and  effect.  The  main
                       disadvantage of longitudinal studies is the long period that’s necessary to carry them

                       out. There’s also the issue of data being diluted due to subjects changing their opinions
                       and attitudes over the duration of a study.
                   6.  Case studies

                       Case studies involve taking a close look at a particular case – an individual, a group of
               individuals, or an organization. This type of data collection is very versatile and can be used

               to  analyze  simple  and  complex  subjects.  Case  studies  tend  to  provide  detailed,  in-depth
               information. Researchers analyzing a case study might use other methods to collect data.
               They might take advantage of questionnaires, interviews, or group discussions.

               Quantitative surveys
               Quantitative surveys consist of a list of queries which respondents can answer by choosing

               the appropriate answer from a list of responses. Questions used in quantitative surveys are
               necessarily close-ended to ensure measurability. They can either be categorical (e.g., yes/no
               questions) or interval/ratio questions (e.g., on a scale of 1 to 10). Quantitative survey questions

               need to be straightforward and easy to understand. There should be no hint of ambiguity in
               these types of questions.
               Quantitative  surveys  are  standardized,  and  their  results  can  be  used  to  make  reliable

               generalizations.  Their  findings  can  be  presented  in  the  form  of  charts  and  graphs,  which
               makes them easier to understand. These surveys can be conducted online, in-person, or over
               the phone. Out of these three methods, online surveys are certainly the easiest to conduct.

               An online survey can be hosted on your own website or with a third-party provider. The link to
               the  survey  can  then  be  shared  in  a  variety  of  places,  including  social  media  and  email

               messaging.
                   1.  Interviews
                          Interviews are another way to collect quantitative data. Researchers can conduct

                   interviews  in-person,  online,  or  over  the  phone.  The  benefit  of  conducting  in-person
                   interviews  is  that  the  researcher  can  easily  clarify  answers  given  by  interviewees.

                   However, these types of interviews can be very time-consuming if working with a large
                   sample size. Interviews conducted online or over the phone are very cost-effective. They
                   allow researchers to interview a large number of respondents in a short period.


                   2.  Quantitative observation
                          Quantitative  data  can  also  be  collected  through  systematic  observation.

                   Observation is a very simple and affordable way of collecting data. However, since it relies
                   on researchers’ senses, it can be unreliable. The data gathered through observation can]]></page><page Index="630"><![CDATA[be  biased  due  to  researchers’  perception  of  people  or  situations  involved  with  data
                   collection.

                   3.  Experiments
                          An  experiment  is  a  type  of  quantitative  data  collection  method  which  relies  on
                   manipulation of a single independent variable while maintaining control over a number of

                   other,  usually  dependent,  variables.  The  data  gathered  through  experiments  is  most
                   frequently used to analyze relationships and determine correlations.

                       The three main types of experiments include:
                          •  Laboratory  experiments –  These  types  of  experiments  take  place  in  a
                              controlled  environment,  with  researchers  having  strict  control  over  all  the

                              variables involved.
                          •  Field experiments – Take place in a natural environment where full control of

                              variables might not be available.
                          •  Natural  experiments –  In  these  types  of  experiments,  researchers  have  no
                              control over variables, and data is collected by letting variables occur naturally.



























               Collecting data through qualitative and quantitative research
                       Data  allows  you  to  make  better,  informed  decisions.  It  can  help  you  gain  a  better

               understanding  of  your  audience,  find  areas  for  improvement  in  your  organization,  identify
               patterns, and personalize your business’ messaging. When looking to collect data, you need

               to decide what information you need, set a time frame for data collection, and choose a data
               collection method.
                       Once  you’ve  decided  on  the  above,  you  can  proceed  to  collect  data.  After  you’ve

               finished the data collection process, you can go on to analyze the data and draw conclusions.]]></page><page Index="631"><![CDATA[The  two  main  types  of  data  collection  methods  you  have  at  your  disposal  include
               qualitative and quantitative data collection methods.

                       Qualitative  data  collection  methods  rely  on  opinions,  descriptive  phrases,  and
               researchers’ subjective conclusions. Face-to-face interviews, qualitative questionnaires, focus
               groups, observation, longitudinal studies, and case studies are examples of qualitative data

               collection methods.
                       Quantitative data collection methods, on the other hand, deal with numbers and are

               highly  standardized.  Examples  of  quantitative  data collection methods  include  quantitative
               surveys, interviews, quantitative observations, and experiments.
                       Which type of data collection you’re going to use will depend on your specific topic of

               research,  as  well  the  resources  you  have  available.  In  most  cases,  a  combination  of
               quantitative and qualitative data collection methods is the best way to go.

                       Start by using qualitative research to discover issues that need to be addressed and
               form a hypothesis. Then, use quantitative research to test your hypothesis and come up with
               results that can be analyzed easily.

               Finally, use the results you’ve obtained from your quantitative research to discover
               relationships and correlations that can help you understand the issue better and potentially
               solve it.

                                                    DATA ANALYSIS


               What is Data Analysis in Research?
                       According to LeCompte and Schensul, research data analysis is a process used by
               researchers for reducing data to a story and interpreting it to derive insights. The data analysis

               process helps in reducing a large chunk of data into smaller fragments, which makes sense.
                       Three essential things take place during the data analysis process — the first data
               organization. Summarization and categorization together contribute to becoming the second

               known method used for data reduction. It helps in finding patterns and themes in the data for
               easy identification and linking. Third and the last way is data analysis – researchers do it in

               both top-down or bottom-up fashion.
                       Marshall  and  Rossman,  on  the  other  hand,  describe  data  analysis  as  a  messy,
               ambiguous, and time-consuming, but a creative and fascinating process through which a mass

               of collected data is being brought to order, structure and meaning.
               We can say that “the data analysis and interpretation is a process representing the application
               of deductive and inductive logic to the research and data analysis.”


               Why Analyze Data in Research?
                       Researchers rely heavily on data as they have a story to tell or problems to solve. It

               starts with a question, and data is nothing but an answer to that question. But, what if there is
               no question to ask? Well! It is possible to explore data even without a problem – we call it

               ‘Data  Mining’  which  often  reveal  some  interesting  patterns  within  the  data  that  are  worth
               exploring.]]></page><page Index="633"><![CDATA[Irrelevant to the type of data, researchers explore, their mission, and audiences’ vision
               guide them to find the patterns to shape the story they want to tell. One of the essential things

               expected from researchers while analyzing data is to stay open and remain unbiased towards
               unexpected patterns, expressions, and results. Remember, sometimes, data analysis tells the
               most  unforeseen  yet  exciting  stories  that  were  not  expected  at  the  time  of  initiating  data

               analysis. Therefore, rely on the data you have at hand and enjoy the journey of exploratory
               research.


               Types of Data in Research
                       Every kind of data has a rare quality of describing things after assigning a specific

               value to it. For analysis, you need to organize these values, processed and presented in a
               given context, to make it useful. Data can be in different forms; here are the primary data

               types.
                   ✓  Qualitative data: When the data presented has words and descriptions, then we call
               it qualitative data. Although you can observe this data, it is subjective and harder to analyze

               data  in  research,  especially  for  comparison.  Example:  Quality  data  represents  everything
               describing taste, experience, texture, or an opinion that is considered quality data. This type
               of data is usually collected through focus groups, personal interviews, or using open-ended

               questions in surveys.
                   ✓  Quantitative data: Any data expressed in numbers of numerical figures are called
               quantitative data. This type of data can be distinguished into categories, grouped, measured,

               calculated, or ranked. Example: questions such as age, rank, cost, length, weight, scores, etc.
               everything comes under this type of data. You can present such data in graphical format,

               charts,  or  apply  statistical  analysis  methods  to  this  data.  The  (Outcomes  Measurement
               Systems) OMS questionnaires in surveys are a significant source of collecting numeric data.
                   ✓  Categorical data: It is data presented in groups. However, an item included in the

               categorical data cannot belong to more than one group. Example: A person responding to a
               survey by telling his living style, marital status, smoking habit, or drinking habit comes under

               the categorical data. A chi-square test is a standard method used to analyze this data.

               Data Analysis in Qualitative Research

                       Data analysis and qualitative data research work a little differently from the numerical
               data as the quality data is made up of words, descriptions, images, objects, and sometimes
               symbols. Getting insight from such complicated information is a complicated process. Hence

               it is typically used for exploratory research and data analysis.]]></page><page Index="634"><![CDATA[Finding Patterns in the Qualitative Data
                       Although there are several ways to find patterns in the textual information, a word-

               based method  is the most  relied  and  widely  used  global technique  for research  and  data
               analysis.  Notably,  the  data  analysis  process  in  qualitative  research  is  manual.  Here  the
               researchers usually read the available data and find repetitive or commonly used words.

               For example, while studying data collected from African countries to understand the most
               pressing  issues  people  face,  researchers  might  find  “food”  and  “hunger”  are  the  most

               commonly used words and will highlight them for further analysis.
                       The keyword context is another widely used word-based technique. In this method, the
               researcher tries to understand the concept by analyzing the context in which the participants

               use a particular keyword.
                       For  example,  researchers  conducting  research  and  data  analysis  for  studying  the

               concept of ‘diabetes’ amongst respondents might analyze the context of when and how the
               respondent has used or referred to the word ‘diabetes.’
                       The scrutiny-based technique is also one of the highly recommended text analysis

               methods used to identify a quality data pattern. Compare and contrast is the widely used
               method under this technique to differentiate how a specific text is similar or different from each
               other.

                       For  example:  To  find  out  the  “importance  of  resident  doctor  in  a  company,”  the
               collected data is divided into people who think it is necessary to hire a resident doctor and
               those who think it is unnecessary. Compare and contrast is the best method that can be used

               to analyze the polls having single answer questions types.
                       Metaphors can be used to reduce the data pile and find patterns in it so that it becomes

               easier to connect data with theory.
                       Variable Partitioning is another technique used to split variables so that researchers
               can find more coherent descriptions and explanations from the enormous data.


               Methods Used for Data Analysis in Qualitative Research

                       There are several techniques to analyze the data in qualitative research, but here are
               some commonly used methods,
                   ✓  Content Analysis: It is widely accepted and the most frequently employed technique

               for  data  analysis  in  research  methodology.  It  can  be  used  to  analyze  the  documented
               information  from  text,  images,  and  sometimes from the  physical  items.  It  depends  on  the
               research questions to predict when and where to use this method.

                   ✓  Narrative Analysis: This method is used to analyze content gathered from various
               sources such as personal interviews, field observation, and surveys. The majority of times,]]></page><page Index="635"><![CDATA[stories,  or  opinions  shared  by  people  are  focused  on  finding  answers  to  the  research
               questions.

                   ✓  Discourse  Analysis:  Similar  to  narrative  analysis,  discourse  analysis  is  used  to
               analyze the interactions with people. Nevertheless, this particular method considers the social
               context  under  which  or  within  which  the  communication  between  the  researcher  and

               respondent takes place. In addition to that, discourse analysis also focuses on the lifestyle
               and day-to-day environment while deriving any conclusion.

                   ✓  Grounded  Theory:  When  you  want  to  explain  why  a  particular  phenomenon
               happened, then using grounded theory for analyzing quality data is the best resort. Grounded
               theory is applied to study data about the host of similar cases occurring in different settings.

               When researchers are using this method, they might alter explanations or produce new ones
               until they arrive at some conclusion.




                                   DATA ANALYSIS IN QUANTITATIVE RESEARCH


               Preparing Data for Analysis
                       The first stage in research and data analysis is to make it for the analysis so that the
               nominal data can be converted into something meaningful. Data preparation consists of the

               below phases.
               Phase I: Data Validation

                       Data validation is done to understand if the collected data sample is per the pre-set
               standards, or it is a biased data sample again divided into four different stages
                   ✓  Fraud: To ensure an actual human being records each response to the survey or the

               questionnaire
                   ✓  Screening: To make sure each participant or respondent is selected or chosen in
               compliance with the research criteria

                   ✓  Procedure: To ensure ethical standards were maintained while collecting the data
               sample
                   ✓  Completeness: To ensure that the respondent has answered all the questions in an

               online survey. Else, the interviewer had asked all the questions devised in the questionnaire.


               Phase II: Data Editing
                       More  often,  an  extensive  research  data  sample  comes  loaded  with  errors.
               Respondents sometimes fill in some fields incorrectly or sometimes skip them accidentally.

               Data editing is a process wherein the researchers have to confirm that the provided data is]]></page><page Index="636"><![CDATA[free of such errors. They need to conduct necessary checks and outlier checks to edit the raw
               edit and make it ready for analysis.


               Phase III: Data Coding
                       Out  of  all  three, this  is the most  critical  phase  of  data  preparation  associated  with

               grouping and assigning values to the survey responses. If a survey is completed with a 1000
               sample size, the researcher will create an age bracket to distinguish the respondents based

               on their age. Thus, it becomes easier to analyze small data buckets rather than deal with the
               massive data pile.


               Methods Used for Data Analysis in Quantitative Research
                       After the data is prepared for analysis, researchers are open to using different research

               and data analysis methods to derive meaningful insights. For sure, statistical techniques are
               the most favored to analyze numerical data. The method is again classified into two groups.
               First, ‘Descriptive Statistics’ used to describe data. Second, ‘Inferential statistics’ that helps in

               comparing the data.

               Descriptive Statistics

                       This  method  is  used  to  describe  the  basic  features  of  versatile  types  of  data  in
               research. It presents the data in such a meaningful way that pattern in the data starts making
               sense. Nevertheless, the descriptive analysis does not go beyond making conclusions. The

               conclusions are again based on the hypothesis researchers have formulated so far. Here are
               a few major types of descriptive analysis methods.


               Measures of Frequency
                   ✓  Count, Percent, Frequency

                   ✓  It is used to denote home often a particular event occurs.
                   ✓  Researchers use it when they want to showcase how often a response is given.

               Measures of Central Tendency
                   •  Mean, Median, Mode
                   •  The method is widely used to demonstrate distribution by various points.

                   •  Researchers use this method when they want to showcase the most commonly or
                       averagely indicated response.

               Measures of Dispersion or Variation
                   •  Range, Variance, Standard deviation
                   •  Here the field equals high/low points.]]></page><page Index="637"><![CDATA[•  Variance standard deviation = difference between the observed score and mean

                   •  It is used to identify the spread of scores by stating intervals.
                   •  Researchers use this method to showcase data spread out. It helps them identify the
                       depth until which the data is spread out that it directly affects the mean.

               Measures of Position
                   •  Percentile ranks, Quartile ranks

                   •  It  relies  on  standardized  scores  helping  researchers  to  identify  the  relationship
                       between different scores.

                   •  It is often used when researchers want to compare scores with the average count.

                       For  quantitative  market  research  use  of  descriptive  analysis  often  give  absolute

               numbers,  but  the  analysis  is  never  sufficient  to  demonstrate  the  rationale  behind  those
               numbers. Nevertheless, it is necessary to think of the best method for research and data
               analysis  suiting  your  survey  questionnaire  and  what  story  researchers  want  to  tell.  For

               example, the mean is the best way to demonstrate the students’ average scores in schools. It
               is better to rely on the descriptive statistics when the researchers intend to keep the research

               or outcome limited to the provided sample without generalizing it. For example, when you want
               to compare average voting done in two different cities, differential statistics are enough.
                       Descriptive analysis is also called a ‘univariate analysis’ since it is commonly used to

               analyze a single variable.

               Inferential Statistics

                       Inferential  statistics  are  used  to  make  predictions  about  a  larger  population  after
               research and data analysis of the representing population’s collected sample. For example,
               you  can  ask  some  odd  100  audiences  at  a  movie  theater  if  they  like  the  movie  they  are

               watching. Researchers then use inferential statistics on the collected sample to reason that
               about 80-90% of people like the movie.

               Here are two significant areas of inferential statistics.
                   •  Estimating  parameters:  It  takes  statistics  from  the  sample  research  data  and
                       demonstrates something about the population parameter.

                   •  Hypothesis test: It’s about sampling research data to answer the survey research
                       questions.  For  example,  researchers  might  be  interested  to  understand  if  the  new

                       shade of lipstick recently launched is good or not, or if the multivitamin capsules help
                       children to perform better at games.]]></page><page Index="638"><![CDATA[These are sophisticated analysis methods used to showcase the relationship between
               different variables instead of describing a single variable. It is often used when researchers

               want something beyond absolute numbers to understand the relationship between variables.
               Here are some of the commonly used methods for data analysis in research.

                   •  Correlation: When researchers are not conducting experimental research wherein the
                       researchers  are  interested  to  understand  the  relationship  between  two  or  more
                       variables, they opt for correlational research methods.

                   •  Cross-tabulation: Also called contingency tables, cross-tabulation is used to analyze
                       the  relationship  between  multiple  variables.    Suppose  provided  data  has  age  and

                       gender categories presented in rows and columns. A two-dimensional cross-tabulation
                       helps for seamless data analysis and research by showing the number of males and
                       females in each age category.

                   •  Regression  analysis:  For  understanding  the  strong  relationship  between  two
                       variables, researchers do not look beyond the primary and commonly used regression
                       analysis method, which is also a type of predictive analysis used. In this method, you

                       have  an  essential  factor  called  the  dependent  variable.  You  also  have  multiple
                       independent  variables  in  regression  analysis.  You  undertake  efforts to find  out  the

                       impact  of  independent  variables  on  the  dependent  variable.  The  values  of  both
                       independent and dependent variables are assumed as being ascertained in an error-
                       free random manner.

                   •  Frequency tables: The statistical procedure is used for testing the degree to which
                       two or more vary or differ in an experiment. A considerable degree of variation means

                       research findings  were significant. In  many  contexts,  ANOVA testing  and  variance
                       analysis are similar.
                   •  Analysis of variance: The statistical procedure is used for testing the degree to which

                       two or more vary or differ in an experiment. A considerable degree of variation means
                       research findings  were significant. In  many  contexts,  ANOVA testing  and  variance

                       analysis are similar.

               Considerations in Research Data Analysis

                       Researchers must have the necessary skills to analyze the data, Getting trained to
               demonstrate a high standard of research practice. Ideally, researchers must possess more
               than a basic understanding of the rationale of selecting one statistical method over the other

               to obtain better data insights.]]></page><page Index="639"><![CDATA[Usually, research and data analytics methods differ by scientific discipline; therefore,
               getting statistical advice at the beginning of analysis helps design a survey questionnaire,

               select data collection methods, and choose samples.
                       The primary aim of data research and analysis is to derive ultimate insights that are
               unbiased.  Any  mistake  in  or  keeping  a  biased  mind  to  collect  data,  selecting  an  analysis

               method, or choosing audience sample il to draw a biased inference.
                       Irrelevant to the sophistication used in research data and analysis is enough to rectify

               the poorly defined objective outcome measurements. It does not matter if the design is at fault
               or intentions are not clear, but lack of clarity might mislead readers, so avoid the practice.
                       The motive behind data analysis in research is to present accurate and reliable data.

               As far as possible, avoid statistical errors, and find a way to deal with everyday challenges like
               outliers, missing data, data altering, data mining, or developing graphical representation.

               The sheer amount of data generated daily is frightening. Especially when data analysis has
               taken  center  stage.  in  2018.  In  last  year,  the  total  data  supply  amounted  to  2.8  trillion
               gigabytes. Hence, it is clear that the enterprises willing to survive in the hypercompetitive world

               must possess an excellent capability to analyze complex research data, derive actionable
               insights, and adapt to the new market needs.


               What should a data-analysis write-up look like?
                       Writing up the results of a data analysis is not a skill that anyone is born with. It requires
               practice and, at least in the beginning, a bit of guidance.


               Organization

                       When writing your report, organization will set you free. A good outline is: 1) overview
               of the problem, 2) your data and modeling approach, 3) the results of your data analysis (plots,
               numbers, etc), and 4) your substantive conclusions.

               1) Overview
                       Describe  the  problem.  What  substantive  question  are  you  trying  to  address?  This

               needn’t be long, but it should be clear.
               2) Data and model
                       What  data  did  you  use  to  address  the  question,  and  how  did  you  do  it?  When

               describing your approach, be specific. For example:
                   •  Don’t say, “I ran a regression” when you instead can say, “I fit a linear regression model
                       to predict price that included a house’s size and neighborhood as predictors.”

                   •  Justify important features of your modeling approach. For example: “Neighborhood
                       was included as a categorical predictor in the model because Figure 2 indicated clear

                       differences in price across the neighborhoods.”]]></page><page Index="640"><![CDATA[Sometimes your Data and Model section will contain plots or tables, and sometimes it
               won’t. If you feel that a plot helps the reader understand the problem or data set itself—as

               opposed to your results—then go ahead and include it. A great example here is Tables 1 and
               2 in the main paper on the PREDIMED study. These tables help the reader understand some
               important properties of the data and approach, but not the results of the study itself.

               3) Results
                       In your results section, include any figures and tables necessary to make your case.

               Label them (Figure 1, 2, etc), give them informative captions, and refer to them in the text by
               their numbered labels where you discuss them. Typical things to include here may include:
               pictures of the data; pictures and tables that show the fitted model; tables of model coefficients

               and summaries.
               4) Conclusion

                       What did you learn from the analysis? What is the answer, if any, to the question you
               set out to address?

                          COMMUNICATING RESEARCH RESULTS: REPORT GENERATION,
                                       ORAL PRESENTATION AND FOLLOW-UP


               Insights from the Communications Model
                       Communication  Process  is  the  process  by  which  one  person  or  source  sends  a
               message to an audience or receiver and then receives feedback about the message. Several

               elements influence successful communication.
                   •  The communicator—the source or sender of the message (the writer of the report)

                   •  The message—the set of meanings being sent to or received by the audience (the
                       findings of the research project)

                   •  The medium—the way in which the message is delivered to the audience (the oral or
                       written report itself )
                   •  The audience—the receiver or destination of the message (the manager who will make

                       a decision based—we hope—on the report findings)
                   •  Feedback—a communication, also involving a message and channel, that flows in the

                       reverse direction (from the audience to the original communicator) and that may be
                       used to modify subsequent communications (the manager’s response to the report)


               The Report in Context
                       A research report is an oral presentation and/or written statement whose purpose is to

               communicate  research  results,  strategic  recommendations,  and/or  other  conclusions  to

                                            USE OF EFFECTIVE GRAPHICS


               Graphic Aids

                       Used properly, graphic aids can clarify complex points or emphasize a message. Used
               improperly or sloppily, they can distract or even mislead a reader. Graphic aids aids work best
               when they are an integral part of the text.]]></page><page Index="643"><![CDATA[Tables
                       Tables are most useful for presenting numerical information, especially when several

               pieces of information have been gathered about each item discussed.
               Charts
                       Charts translate numerical information into visual form so that relationships may be

               easily grasped. The accuracy of the numbers is reduced to gain this advantage.
               •  Pie Charts

                   One of the most useful kinds of charts is the pie chart, which shows the composition of
               some total quantity at a particular time.
























               •  Line Graphs

                   Line graphs are useful for showing the relationship of one variable to another. The
               dependent variable generally is shown on the vertical axis, and the independent variable on
               the horizontal axis. The most common independent variable for such charts is time, but it is

               by no means the only one. (On the right is a Stratum Chart)
















               •  Bar Charts
                   A bar chart shows changes in the value of a dependent variable (plotted on the vertical
               axis) at discrete intervals of the independent variable (on the horizontal axis).]]></page><page Index="644"><![CDATA[THE ORAL PRESENTATION


               Oral Presentation
                       A spoken summary of the major findings, conclusions, and recommendations, given to
               clients or line managers to provide them with the opportunity to clarify any ambiguous issues

               by asking questions. The purpose of an oral presentation is to highlight the most important
               findings of a research project and provide clients or line managers with an opportunity to ask

               questions. The oral presentation may be as simple as a short video conference with a manager
               at the client organization’s location or as formal as a report to the company board of directors.
                       Graphic and other visual aids can be as useful in an oral presentation as in a written

               one. Presenters can choose from a variety of media. Slides, overhead-projector acetates, and
               on-screen  computer-generated  graphics  are  useful  for  larger  audiences.  For  smaller

               audiences, the researcher may put the visual aids on posters or flip charts. Another possibility
               is to make copies of the charts for each participant, possibly as a supplement to one of the
               other forms of presentation.
                       Using gestures during presentations also can help convey the message and make

               presentations more interesting. Here are some tips on how to gesture
                   •  Open up your arms to embrace your audience. Keep your arms between your waist

               and shoulders.
                   •  Drop your arms to your sides when not using them.

                   •  Avoid quick and jerky gestures, which make you appear nervous. Hold gestures longer
               that you would in normal conversation.

                   •  Vary gestures. Switch from hand to hand and at other times use both hands or no
               hands.
                   ✓  Don’t overuse gestures.]]></page><page Index="645"><![CDATA[Summative Activity

                1. develop conclusions based on the results

                2. recommend strategies and actions to resolve research problem



                                             DEVELOPING CONCLUSIONS


               Conclusion
                       The conclusion is intended to help the reader understand why your research should

               matter  to  them  after  they  have  finished  reading  the  paper.  A  conclusion  is  not  merely  a
               summary  of  the  main  topics  covered  or  a  re-statement  of  your  research  problem,  but  a
               synthesis  of  key  points  and,  if  applicable,  where  you  recommend  new  areas  for  future

               research. For most college-level research papers, one or two well-developed paragraphs is
               sufficient  for  a  conclusion,  although  in  some  cases,  three  or  more  paragraphs  may  be
               required.


               Importance of a Good Conclusion

                       A well-written conclusion provides you with important opportunities to demonstrate to
               the reader your understanding of the research problem. These include:
                   ✓  Presenting  the  last  word  on  the  issues  you  raised  in  your  paper.  Just  as  the

               introduction gives a first impression to your reader, the conclusion offers a chance to leave a
               lasting impression. Do this, for example, by highlighting key findings in your analysis or result

               section or by noting important or unexpected implications applied to practice.
                   ✓  Summarizing your thoughts and conveying the larger significance of your study. The
               conclusion is an opportunity to succinctly answer [or in some cases, to re-emphasize]  the "So

               What?" question by placing the study within the context of how your research advances past
               research about the topic.
                   ✓  Identifying how a gap in the literature has been addressed. The conclusion can be

               where you describe how a previously identified gap in the literature [described in your literature
               review section] has been filled by your research.]]></page><page Index="649"><![CDATA[✓  Demonstrating the importance of your ideas. Don't be shy. The conclusion offers you
               the opportunity to elaborate on the impact and significance of your findings.

                   ✓  Introducing possible new or expanded ways of thinking about the research problem.
               This does not refer to introducing new information [which should be avoided], but to offer new
               insight and creative approaches for framing or contextualizing the research problem based on

               the results of your study.


               General Rules
                   When writing the conclusion to your paper, follow these general rules:
                   ✓  State your conclusions in clear, simple language. Re-state the purpose of your study

               then state how your findings differ or support those of other studies and why [i.e., what were
               the unique or new contributions your study made to the overall research about your topic?].

                   ✓  Do  not  simply  reiterate  your  results  or  the  discussion  of  your  results.  Provide  a
               synthesis of arguments presented in the paper to show how these converge to address the
               research problem and the overall objectives of your study

                   ✓  Indicate  opportunities  for  future  research  if  you  haven't  already  done  so  in  the
               discussion  section  of  your  paper.  Highlighting  the  need  for  further  research  provides  the
               reader with evidence that you have an in-depth awareness of the research problem.


                   The Conclusions section sums up the key points of your discussion, the essential features
               of your design, or the significant outcomes of your investigation. As its function is to round off

               the story of your project, it should:
                   ✓  be written to relate directly to the aims of the project as stated in the Introduction

                   ✓  indicate the extent to which the aims have been achieved
                   ✓  summarise the key findings, outcomes or information in your report
                   ✓  acknowledge  limitations  and  make  recommendations  for  future  work  (where

                       applicable)
                   ✓  highlight the significance or usefulness of your work..



                                          DEVELOPING RECOMMENDATIONS


               Based On Your Findings What Are Your Recommendations?
                       The recommendations that you introduce in your research paper are essential to the

               plans  you  have  to  move  your  field  of  study  forward.  Recommendations  are  the  added
               suggestions that you want people to follow when performing future studies. These are based
               off of what you have found or what you might be interested in doing at some point in the future.]]></page><page Index="650"><![CDATA[As you write these recommendations, you will have to look at what you have gotten
               out of your paper while also thinking about any possible ideas you might have for later research

               studies. This can help with producing a strong paper that will inspire people to think differently
               about whatever it is you have written and could especially inspire new research to come about
               over time.


               What Can Be Done?

                       When  writing  your  recommendations,  you  can  talk  about  the  steps  that  should  be
               followed in future studies. These include steps that are needed to implement particular policies
               or actions that you want to follow. Any resources that would be required in the process should

               be explained as well. You must be specific when talking about what you might be interested
               in doing in the future with regards to making any potential studies stand out and work to your

               favor.

               Explain the Benefits

                       You can always mention the benefits of further studies in your field. Talk about how
               future  studies  could  be  used  to  correct  problems  with  the  current  research  you  have
               completed. You can also explain a need to fill in certain gaps that you might not be able to get

               covered right now for any reason. You can always use a timeline to help readers understand
               when potential developments could come about over time.


               How Feasible Is a Study?
                       Next, you should talk about how feasible certain points in your study might be. This

               includes understanding whether certain ideas should be explored in further detail later on. This
               works well if you are trying to talk about certain points that might be worthwhile. You could
               even talk about potential new developments in your field and whether your study is relevant

               to them or if additional developments have to be incorporated into your work.


               What Additional Research Is Needed?
                       There are often times when added research would be required to make it easier for a
               study to go forward. Your research plans could include an analysis of the methods of study

               that could work in the future and what points about a topic could be reviewed in such studies.
                       The recommendations that are incorporated into your paper can certainly be important
               to your work. Be certain when writing your paper that you have clear recommendations that

               are easy to follow and can be utilized right and are not overly complicated or tough to use in
               some way.]]></page><page Index="651"><![CDATA[Summative Activity

                                      The Basics of Market Research

                                                                          Week 2 – September 14 - 18, 2020

                “Research is to see what everybody else has seen, and to think what nobody else has thought.”
                                                    --Albert Szent-Gyorgi

               Chapter Learning Outcomes
               By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

                   1.  define market research;
                   2.  determine the role and use of market research to business organizations; and

                   3.  identify the researchable market issues.





                                         The Role and Use of Market Research
                       Customers always have been the most important part of a business. Today, if you do
               not put the customer at the center of your business, you will, over time, have no business. In

               other  words,  market  research  or  market  intelligence  has  always  been  with  us.  However,
               market research is a bit more than the informal assimilation and interpretation of intelligence
               that is a natural consequence of keeping eyes and ears open.

                       According to Philip Kotler, “Marketing research is a systematic problem analysis, model
               building  and  fact  finding  for  the  purpose  of  improved  decision-making  and  control  in  the
               marketing of goods and services.”

                       Specifically, marketing research is the function that links the consumer, customer, and
               public to the marketer through information–information used to identify and define marketing
               opportunities  and  problems;  generate,  refine,  and  evaluate  marketing  actions;  monitor

               marketing performance; and improve understanding of marketing as a process. Marketing
               research specifies the information required to address these issues, designs the method for

               collecting information, manages and implements the data collection process, analyzes the
               results, and communicates the findings and their implications (AMA, 2017).
                       Marketing research is used to answer fundamental questions that affect the future of

               an organization. Therefore, marketing research is a skill needed by all types of organizations,
               both large and small. Small businesses as well as large corporations can benefit from the

               knowledge  that  research  provides.  In  addition,  community,  arts  and  other  non-profit
               organizations can also benefit.
                       Small  businesses  may  believe  that  they  do  not  have  the  resources  to  conduct

               marketing research. However, a small business usually operates on a narrow profit margin]]></page><page Index="656"><![CDATA[4


               leaving it particularly vulnerable to competition. Even losing a small percentage of customers
               can mean potential bankruptcy. Therefore, small businesses need to research what products

               and services customers want and need. In addition, it is essential that they conduct research
               on  a  continual  basis  as  to  what  products  and  services  are  being  offered  by  competing
               businesses.

                       Non-profit  organizations  may  also  feel  that  they  do  not  have  the  time  or  money
               necessary  to  conduct  research.  Yet  all  types  of  non-profit  organizations  can  benefit  from

               conducting  research.  For  example,  community-based  social  service  non-profits  could  use
               research to determine what services are needed by the people they serve. Other non-profits,
               such as arts organizations, face the challenge of finding audiences and can use research to

               help with segmentation and promotion decisions.
                       Large corporations often have internal marketing research departments. Even so, they

               sometimes hire specialized external marketing research firms to conduct research. Marketing
               research  is  especially  necessary  when  corporations  develop  new  products  or  reposition
               current  products.  Research  is  needed to  thoroughly  analyze  consumer needs,  as  a  failed

               introduction or repositioning of a product can be a very costly mistake.

                                                    Research Issues

                       There are a number of different issues that an organization can choose to research
               (see Table 1.1). Research on the consumer marketplace can be used to determine who is
               buying a specific product. Companies should also consider conducting research regarding

               competitors’ products and services as it can provide valuable information on how a business
               can  improve.  For  example,  organizations  should  analyze  their  customers’  perception  of

               competitors, as such research helps to determine whether companies should add to their own
               products any of the benefits provided by competing products.
                       Market  research  can  determine  the  composition  of  the  current  customer  segment.

               Consumer research can examine customers’ reasons for purchasing and is critical to both
               increasing the current market segment and finding new target markets. Distribution research]]></page><page Index="657"><![CDATA[5


               is conducted to determine if the product is being sold at the right locations. Organizations also
               need to use research to determine if a specific product has the benefits that consumers desire.

               Another important area of research is determining if a product is being effectively promoted.
               Lastly,  determining  the  correct  price  for  a  product  can  make  the  difference  between  a
               successful and unsuccessful product launch. Information gathered on all of these issues will

               help businesses to learn where and how they need to improve.

                       Marketing research focuses on understanding the customer, the company, and the
               competition.  These  relationships  are  at  the  core  of  marketing  research.  Companies  must
               understand  and  respond  to  what  customers  want  from  their  products.  However,  this

               relationship is always influenced by competitors and how their products are received by the
               market.  Thus,  market  researchers  must  clearly  identify  the  customer,  company,  and

               competition before developing a research project.
                       There are several important factors a market researcher must consider before they
               begin, including:

                       •  Customers and competition
                       •  Awareness and image of the product

                       •  Product usage
                       •  Undiagnosed problems with the product

                       •  Customer desires and needs for new product development]]></page><page Index="658"><![CDATA[6

                                              intelligence into marketing insight.

               Chapter Learning Outcomes
               By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

                       1.  describe the steps in the research process; and
                       2.  explain the approaches to conducting research.

                       3.  briefly describe the different marketing research methods.



                                                 The Research Process

                       Too  often,  when  a  company  conducts  research  it  begins  without  proper  planning.
               However,  the  chances  of  finding  the  correct  answer  to  a  research  question  are  greatly

               increased by following a specific six-step process (see Figure 2.1). The process starts with
               determining what the organization needs to know and where it can find the information. In
               addition, researchers must determine who will participate in the research and the number of

               participants that will be needed. Researchers must then decide what research approach is
               appropriate for the research question and must choose the most suitable research method.

               They must then plan the process of conducting the research. After the research is conducted,
               the final step will be to analyse and report the findings and recommendations.

                                               1. Determine the research question



                                          2. Decide on the sources of information sample

               Determine the Research Question
                       The  first  step,  designing  the  research  question,  is  generally  difficult  and  time

               consuming. Because organizations are often in a hurry for answers, the temptation is to start
               the research process before determining what they really need to know. As a result, they may
               either  ask  a  poorly  defined  research  question or  even the  wrong  question  entirely.  To  be

               effective, a research study must be both well designed and narrowly focused. If the research
               question is too broad, too much information will be obtained. In addition, the large amount of

               resulting data will be difficult to analyze and, therefore, of little use to an organization. Even
               worse,  if  the  wrong  question  is  asked,  the  wrong  information  will  be  obtained  and  all  the
               research effort will be wasted.

               Sources of Information
                       Researchers need to put considerable thought into planning the sources from which

               information can be obtained. The different sources for data are categorized as secondary (data
               that already exist because it has been collected by someone else) and primary (data that the
               researcher collects). In addition, secondary data can be categorized as internal (which the

               company already has) and external (which must be gathered from other sources). Sometimes,
               an organization may even have already collected enough data to answer their question. In
               other  cases,  the  answer  to  a research  question  might  already  be  available  as  a  result  of

               research conducted by other organizations.
                       However, even if a research question is not answered, collecting secondary data can
               help with the design of a primary research method. A researcher will collect primary data

               directly from participants to answer a specific research question. Primary data are usually
               collected  from  a  group  of  participants  called  a  sample.  This  sample  consists  of  selected

               members from an entire group of individuals, which is called a population. These selected
               members can be defined by demographic characteristics such as age, gender, or occupation.
               They also might be defined by psychographic characteristics such as lifestyle or opinions. In

               addition,  they  can  be  defined  by  their  geographic  location  or  product  usage  levels.  A
               description of the individuals in the sample is called the participant profile.

                       The method used to choose the individuals that will be included in a sample will differ
               depending on what type of research methodology will be used. Probability sampling is used
               to  randomly  select  the  people  in  a  sample.  Nonprobability  sampling  is  utilized  when  the

               judgment of a researcher is used to make the selection.
                       The population being studied could be current customers who frequently purchase a
               product with the purpose of determining how a company can improve that product’s design.

               Past customers could be included in the sample to find sources of consumer dissatisfaction
               or to determine what other competing products they also purchase. Rather than current or
               past customers, potential market segments of interest to that company can also be studied.]]></page><page Index="661"><![CDATA[9


               For example, research can be conducted to determine what type of promotion might motivate
               older  consumers  to  purchase.  Another  purpose  of  researching  a  sample  of  potential

               consumers  is  to  determine  how  a  product  needs  to  be  adapted  to  offer  the  features  and
               benefits they desire. For example, a company that produces camping equipment might include
               in their sample individuals who are interested in extreme sports in order to learn how to adapt

               their product to meet these consumers’ preferences.
               Choose the Research Approach

                       The next step is to choose a research approach. The process of conducting primary
               research starts with deciding whether the research question calls for descriptive, exploratory
               or causal research. The choice will depend on whether or not a research question needs to

               be answered with quantifiable facts. If a research question asks ‘How many?’ or ‘Which one?’,
               descriptive or causal research will probably be used. If a research question asks the question

               ‘Why?’, then exploratory research will probably be used.
                       Understanding  how  an  organization  plans  to  use  the  information  will  also  help  in
               making  an  appropriate  decision.  If  an  organization  wishes  to  prove  a  fact  about  the

               demographic composition of its customers, such as how many females as compared to males
               purchase a product, then a descriptive study would be appropriate. If, on the other hand, an
               organization  wishes  to  discover  why  sales  are  falling,  it  will  need  to  conduct  exploratory

               research. Causal research will help determine the effect of a proposed change.
               Planning the Research Method
                       After choosing the research approach, researchers must design the research method.

               This will include the details of how the research will be conducted, including when, where and
               by  whom.  The  available  research  methods  will  include  surveys,  focus  groups,  interviews,

               projective techniques, observation, ethnography and grounded theory. A research plan will
               include the timeline for the research, the people needed and the budget.
                       For example, this step may involve writing survey questions or the script to be used in

               a focus group. The more detailed the planning, the more smoothly the research will proceed.
               Therefore everything, from the layout of the survey form to who will be responsible for ensuring

               that the focus group participants arrive, should be considered.
               Conducting the Research and Reporting Findings and Recommendations
                       Finally, researchers will be ready to conduct the research. Once done, the final task is

               for researchers to analyze the data and report the findings and conclusions. Analysis requires
               repeatedly  going  over  the  collected  responses  to  find  common  themes,  patterns  and
               connections. Reporting may be in the form of a written report, a verbal presentation, or both.

               A written report presenting the results of a quantitative research study will usually have an
               introduction followed  by  a  description  of the methodology. It  will  also  have  a  section  with
               findings supported with statistics and charts.]]></page><page Index="662"><![CDATA[10


                       These  findings  will  be  the  basis  of  the  recommendations  given  in  the  report.  With
               quantitative research, someone who has not conducted the research can still write the report

               based on the findings.
                       A report for a qualitative research study will follow the same outline. However, because
               there are no statistics or charts different types of visuals will be used to help clients understand

               the findings. Some tools that can be used include diagrams, quotes, photos and even videos.
               With qualitative research, the person who conducted the research must be involved in the

               writing of the report.




                                                 Research Approaches

                       One of the questions that an organization must decide before conducting research is
               which research approach will be most appropriate. The approach chosen will depend on the

               research question and the type of information a company is seeking.
                       As noted earlier, there are three general research approaches: descriptive, exploratory
               and causal. Each can be considered as being similar to a different type of tool box. Each

               approach “box” contains certain tools or methods that are most useful with that approach. After
               deciding the research approach, the company will choose the best method.
                       For example, if a car needs repair a person will open the automotive tool box and

               perhaps select a wrench. If a house needs repair, a carpentry tool box will be opened and a
               hammer may be selected as the needed tool. Each tool box will have a choice of tools that will
               be needed for a specific type of job. However, the first step is choosing the right tool box, not

               the specific tool (see Table 2.1).

               Descriptive Research
                       A company will perform descriptive research when it needs to obtain specific details
               on its consumers and their purchasing behavior. Descriptive research is used when statistical

               data are needed on a fact. The tool used to conduct descriptive research is almost always
               surveys. The advantage of a survey is that, if the number of people surveyed (the sample) is]]></page><page Index="663"><![CDATA[11


               large  enough,  it  can  be  said that  a fact  has  been  proved  and  is true  of the  entire  group.
               Descriptive survey data can give answers such as ‘37 percent of our customers are over the

               age of 55’ or ‘52 percent of our customers purchase four times a year’. If the number of people
               asked to complete the survey is large enough compared to the total population under study,
               the answer can even be said to have been proven.

                       Conducting descriptive research can be expensive and time consuming. However, it
               is necessary if a company wants to prove a guess or hypothesis about consumers or their

               behavior. For example, a descriptive study can be designed to prove that ‘10 percent of all
               current  consumers  will  purchase  the  more  expensive  new  product  model’.  This  guess  or
               hypothesis can be proved within a certain level of confidence that the answer obtained from

               the descriptive survey sample is true of the entire population.
                       However, descriptive research can also be used to obtain details without relying on

               statistical  proof.  Descriptive  research  is  sometimes  used  to  address  issues  that  are  just
               beginning to be explored, such as consumer preferences. Many organizations have relied
               heavily on surveys as their only means of market research. This is unfortunate as the type of

               information  that  surveys  can  provide  is  limited.  Yet  another  reason  for  rethinking  this
               dependence on descriptive surveys is that it is increasingly difficult to find a sufficient number
               of people who are willing to respond. Because people are often pressed for time, and also

               because of privacy issues, it is difficult to motivate people to respond to a survey. In an effort
               to make participation in a survey more convenient, email and social media are increasingly
               being used.

               Exploratory Research
                       Companies  should  use  exploratory  research  when  a  research  question  deals  with

               finding information on consumer attitudes, opinions and beliefs. Such exploratory research
               can be useful even when there is no specific problem to investigate. For example, a company
               might use exploratory research to look for marketing opportunities by researching trends or

               changes  in  consumer  behavior.  The  research  methods  available  to  conduct  exploratory
               studies include focus groups, interviews, projective techniques, observation, ethnography and

               grounded theory.
                       All  of  these  methods  use  a  qualitative  research  approach.  Exploratory  research  is
               designed to let participants provide their own answers. The research question, rather than

               asking for facts, focuses on a consumer’s needs, desires, preferences and values. Because
               so many different answers will result, statistically provable answers cannot be generated, but
               exploratory qualitative studies, if designed with considerable thought as to what information is

               wanted and how it is to be obtained, can provide invaluable information to a company. Such
               a study may be large and complex or it can be conducted on a small scale. Either way, the]]></page><page Index="664"><![CDATA[12


               consumer information received will provide details and insights that will help an organization
               adapt its product, price, promotion and distribution to meet consumer desires.

                       When using exploratory research tools, the emphasis is not on the size of a sample.
               Instead  it  is  on  choosing  the  correct  participants  and  the  analysis  of  the  information  they
               provide. For example, if asked why they purchase a company’s product, even if each individual

               has a unique answer, common themes will almost always appear. A researcher will analyze
               the responses and then group them by these common themes. One advantage of qualitative

               research is that it can also be approached in low-cost ways that are available to even small
               businesses.
               Causal Research

                       If a company wants to study the effect a change in its product will have on consumer
               purchasing  or  the  possible  success  of  a  new  promotional  campaign,  it should  use  causal

               research.  Causal  research  is  conducted  to  discover  whether  the  change  a  company  is
               planning to make will have a positive or negative effect on consumers.
                       Research  questions  that  require  causal  research  have  a  cause  and  effect  –  for

               example,  such  questions  as  ‘Will  a  new  promotion  campaign  using  a  celebrity  increase
               purchases of books among young people?’ or ‘Will customers at the cinema purchase more
               refreshments if we have a new menu?’ These issues can also be explored using experimental

               research. Even the effect of intangible factors on sales, such as smell and sound, can be
               researched.


                       If the change has already happened, internal quantitative data might already exist to
               answer the question. For example, if a company wants to know whether their new menu has
               increased sales, it can look at the sales figures. However, this is an expensive way to learn

               whether  a  new  menu  has  proved  successful.  A  better  use  of  research  would  be  to  use
               qualitative research tools before implementing the change. For example, experimenting by
               trying the new menu on a small scale first, to see whether customer reaction will be positive

               or negative. Such experiments should be carefully designed using the proper subjects and an
               impartial research design so that the results will be accurate.






                                                   Research Methods

                       Once  the  general  approach  is  understood,  the  next  step  will  involve  choosing  a
               research method and then planning the research. Marketing research methods can be divided

               into two different types – quantitative and qualitative. For a small study, research methods of
               only one type might be used. However, for some large-scale studies both types of research]]></page><page Index="665"><![CDATA[13


               may be needed. Quantitative research uses mathematical analysis to provide proof of a fact
               or a hypothesis (guess or assumption). When properly implemented, quantitative research

               can answer questions such as ‘How many consumers prefer our new product?’ or ‘Which of
               these three packaging designs is most attractive to consumers?’
                       The standard tool used when conducting quantitative research is the survey. Survey

               questions  give  participants  a  selected  number  of  responses  such  as  yes/no  or
               frequently/sometimes/never.  The  responses  are  then  entered  into  a  computer  using  a

               statistical  software  package.  The  software  will  tabulate  if  there  are  enough  responses  to
               support a ‘proved’ fact. This proved fact is then said to be true of the group of consumers as
               a whole (population) even though only a selected number (sample) were asked. Of course, it

               is impossible to ask all consumers. Therefore, it is necessary to determine how many people
               should participate in the quantitative survey to support this proof. To determine the correct

               number, researchers use their knowledge of sampling and statistics to construct a sample that
               contains the required number and type of participants.
                       This proof of consumer behavior is important when a company is planning a major

               expenditure, such as the introduction of a new product or a new promotional campaign. While
               quantitative studies can be expensive, because they must be conducted with a large enough
               sample, in some situations they are worth the cost. The cost is acceptable because if the

               wrong decision is made, even more money could be lost.
               Quantitative vs. Qualitative Research
                       Quantitative research is defined as research involving the administration of a set of

               structured questions with predetermined response options to a large number of respondents.
               Qualitative research involves collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data by observing what

               people do and say.
                       While quantitative studies are useful for answering questions such as ‘How many?’
               and ‘What?’, they are not as useful when answering questions such as ‘Why?’ or ‘What if?’ A

               qualitative study is designed to uncover consumer attitudes, beliefs and opinions rather than
               facts. Because it is difficult to know consumer preferences before the study is conducted, a

               quantitative survey form with predetermined answers can result in misleading results. Instead,
               a wider variety of qualitative research tools, including interviews, focus groups, observation
               and projective techniques, is available. These tools, when used by trained researchers, allow

               participants to fully express their opinions and beliefs.
                       Qualitative research uses fewer participants, who are not necessarily representative
               of all consumers in the population; sometimes they are chosen because they belong to a

               distinct  segment,  such  as  older  or  ethnic  consumers.  The  data  that  result  from  using  a
               qualitative approach are not in the form of statistics but rather in ideas and quotes expressed
               by participants and researchers’ notes. Interpretation of the data requires special skills, but]]></page><page Index="666"><![CDATA[14


               correctly analyzed qualitative data can provide a rich source of information for marketing ideas
               including new concepts for segmentation. Social media content can now be used as a data

               source for consumer research. The interpretation of these data requires special skills.

                                      Determining the Research Question

                                                                   Week 4 – September 28 – October 2, 2020

                            “The aim of marketing is to know and understand the customer so well,
                                      the product or service sells itself.” – Peter Drucker

               Chapter Learning Outcomes
               By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

                       1.  identify a research problem; and
                       2.  formulate research questions.



                                          Defining Market Research Problems
                       Every research project should have a defined and explicit objective which clearly states

               why  the  research  is  being  carried  out.  All  other  aspects  of  planning  and  carrying  out  the
               research flow from this objective; in other words, if they do not contribute towards achieving
               this objective they almost certainly should not be undertaken. The objective should relate to

               the marketing decision which will have to be made or the problem that needs a solution (and
               decision).

                       Three questions determine if the research needs to take place:
                        •   What research exists already?
                        •   What research is needed?

                        •   Can the research readily be undertaken?
                       The objectives of research can range from helping a company improve its satisfaction

               rating amongst customers, to finding new markets for its products through to helping with the
               launch of new products. Let’s take an example of a company that is suffering with stagnant
               sales. The objective of the research is to find out the cause of the stagnant sales and how to

               get them moving upwards.
                       Where  the  starting  point  for  the  research  is  a  problem  (or  potential
               problem/opportunity) rather than a clear-cut decision to be made, an effective approach is to

               think of and list as many objectives as possible for the research. The researcher may make a
               specific contribution to this process based on the results of previous research in related areas.
                       Possible reasons for the company’s stagnant sales could be:

                          1.  The market is declining.
                          2.  The prices of the company’s products are too high relative to the competition.

                          3.  The benefits that the company is offering in terms of its products and services
                              relative to the competition are too low.]]></page><page Index="668"><![CDATA[16


                          4.  The  company  is  losing  customers  because  of  a  failure  in  its  products  or
                              services.

                          5.  The people who are buying the company’s products are old and retiring. New
                              buyers do not know of the company.
                          6.  The company’s image is tired and old fashioned.

                          7.  The company’s sales force is not active.
                       With only a little effort, the list of hypotheses generated is likely to be quite extensive

               and probably more than can be sensibly covered in any one research project. This would
               mean that some selection will have to be made of the hypotheses which are to be covered in
               the research project. This is likely to be based on a judgement of which is the more likely

               explanation  of  the  problem;  evidence  that  is  already  available  –  including  from  previous
               research  as  well  as  from  more  informal  sources  –  may  enable  some  hypotheses  to  be

               confidently discounted. For example, in the above listing, if there haven’t been any complaints,
               it could reasonably be assumed that hypothesis number 4 is not valid. However, the sales
               force could be constantly reporting that the prices are too high against the benefits that are

               being offered. This could point to the hypotheses which do seem worth researching and will
               be the basis of a valid research objective.
                       To write out clear objectives you need information about the background of a problem.

               What really lies at the root of the problem? What is the background to the market, or to the
               issue? and What factors led to the current problem?
                       A  useful  framework  for  identifying  the  links  between  a  problem  and  a  research

               objective is shown in Figure 3.1. Write down a high-level question that you think you would
               like to answer. Then think through all the factors that could be causing this question to arise.

               Finally, think through all the information that you need to fully understand about the problem
               and the level of knowledge that you hold on the subject.]]></page><page Index="669"><![CDATA[17

                                          Determining the Research Question
                       Writing a research question that clearly states the problem to be researched takes
               considerable  thought.  Since  this  question  is  the  rationale  for  the  all  research  that  will  be

               conducted, it is well worth the effort to make sure that this question is focused on the correct
               problem.  In  addition,  a  research  question  will  need  to  address  what  current  or  potential

               consumers  will  need to be  asked to  learn  more  about  a  problem.  A  well  written  research
               question  will  make  planning  the  remainder  of  the  research  study  much  easier.  Table  3.1
               provides examples of the relationship between type of organization, specific problems and the

               resulting research questions and Table 3.2 provides detailed questions that can be answered
               by market research.]]></page><page Index="670"><![CDATA[18

               Purpose of the Research Question
                       Good research starts with data, which are turned into information to provide companies

               with the knowledge they need to solve problems. Researchers must always remember that
               research is conducted for the purpose of solving a company’s problems. For research to be]]></page><page Index="671"><![CDATA[19


               useful,  researchers  must  have  an  understanding  of  company’s  needs,  and  not  just  a
               knowledge of research methodology.

                       To provide the necessary information it is important to have the right research question
               stated correctly. The research question may be stated in either an interrogative or declarative
               style. An interrogative research question identifies the information needed in question form:

               for example, “What type of media is the best means to communicate promotions to college
               age males?” A declarative research question identifies the information needed as a statement:

               for  example,  “The  purpose  of  this  research  is  to  determine  the  best  media  to  use  when
               communicating promotions to college age males.” Either form can be used as the start of a
               research proposal.

               Writing the Research Question
                       For both quantitative and qualitative studies, the question itself needs to be as narrowly

               defined as possible. To do so, researchers must define who, where, what, when and how as
               will be used in the question (shown in Table 3.3 below).

               Table 3.3 Defining the research question
                Who?         Describe the participants who will take part in the research by demographic, psychographic
                             and usage characteristics
                Where?       The geographic location of current or potential consumers or the area of product sales
                When?        The time frame of the behavior under study
                What?        A specific description of the product
                Why?         The attitude or motivation of concern to researchers
                How?         The proposed actions that could be undertaken by the company

                       This  includes  whose  behavior  is  of  concern  to  the  researchers.  For  example,  the
               question as to why young consumers are purchasing fewer soft drinks could be improved by
               defining what age group is meant by “young” consumers. They also must decide if they want

               this information on all young consumers or only those from a certain income level.
                       Researchers should also be concerned about where the behavior under study is taking

               place. For example, they must decide if they mean all young consumers nationally or only
               those living in urban areas. The geographic area might also be defined by where the product
               is sold. In the case of company expansion, the area might also be where a product will be sold

               in the future.
                       Researchers must also establish the time frame for the behavior that is being studied.
               For example, the research question might ask about changes in behavior in the last month,

               year  or  longer. In  addition, researchers must  define  what  products they  are  studying.  For
               example, are they interested in sales of all of a company’s soft drink products, or only a certain
               brand, package style or size? The question could be rephrased as, “Why are sales of our fruit

               flavored soft drinks declining among young, single females, aged 18–24, living in metropolitan]]></page><page Index="672"><![CDATA[20


               areas, and who are financially independent from their families?” The question could be further
               improved by more clearly defining the “Why?” in the above question. It could be clearly stated

               as “due to increased concern about healthy eating”. Of course, this may not be possible if the
               researchers have not been able to come to this conclusion before the start of the research
               process.

                       The question of “How can we regain our market share of young soft drink consumers?’
               also needs to be stated more specifically because there can be so many possible means to

               regain market share. The means could include price decreases, packaging changes, product
               enhancements or new promotional campaigns. Most companies will not have the resources
               to plan and conduct primary research to answer all of these questions. The final decision on

               which question to research will be based on analyzing the benefits of the research versus the
               cost. After considering these factors, the final question could be restated as “What type of

               promotional message will motivate purchase of our fruit flavored soft drink by health-conscious
               females, aged 14–18, living at home in suburban areas, over the next year?” Sometimes who
               should be the focus of the question will change over time.

                       There  are  general  rules  that  should  be  remembered  when  a  research  question  is
               written. First, the question should be an assertion of fact on which the researcher takes a side.
               It should not be stated in vague terms such as “The reason for declining sales may be a lack

               of promotion.” The purpose of the research will be to determine if it is, or if it isn’t. Therefore,
               the researcher must decide which way to state the question – but it can’t be both ways.
                       In addition, the researcher must state the question so that it argues only one point of

               fact. The question “Are sales declining because of a lack of promotion or because of increased
               competition?”  is  actually  two  research  questions.  Different  methodologies  and  different

               research participants may be needed for each. Thus, if the researcher tries to combine them,
               the research may answer neither question.
                       Lastly, a research question must pass the “So what?” test. Does the question generate

               enough  interest  from  management  that  they  will  be  willing  to  approve  the  research?  The
               answer  must  lead  to  a  recommendation  that  will  either  significantly  increase  revenue  or

               decrease expenses, or it will not be approved.
                       Research questions can be developed for any component of the marketing mix and,
               also, the target market segment and consumer behavior. Table 3.4 below provides examples

               of research questions that could be asked for each component of the marketing mix.]]></page><page Index="673"><![CDATA[21


               Table 3.4 Sample research questions
                Target market     What is the consumer demographic profile most likely to purchase our product?

                Pricing           Will raising the price of our basic product 5 per cent negatively affect sales?
                                  Are younger consumers aged 14–18 less sensitive to price changes?
                                  Will parents aged 25–40 prefer lower quality if it means lower prices?

                                                                           Week 5 – October 5 -10, 2020

                               “The secret of getting ahead is getting started.” – Mark Twain


               Chapter Learning Outcomes
               By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

                   1.  explain the components of a research report;
                   2.  properly cite author(s), indirect sources, and electronic sources; and
                   3.  define secondary data, their benefits, uses, sources and process.




                                             Content of a Research Report
                       Research  reports  are  detailed  and  accurate  accounts  of the  conduct  of  disciplined

               studies accomplished to solve problems or to reveal new knowledge. Accurate and thorough
               information is the foundation of all successful business ventures because it provides a wealth

               of information about prospective and existing customers, the competition, and the industry in
               general. It allows business owners to determine the feasibility of a business before committing
               substantial resources to the venture.

                       Market  research  provides  relevant  data  to  help  solve  marketing  challenges  that  a
               business  will  most  likely  face  an  integral  part  of  the  business  planning  process.  In  fact,

               strategies  such  as  market  segmentation  (identifying  specific  groups  within  a  market)  and
               product differentiation (creating an identity for a product or service that separates it from those
               of the competitors) are impossible to develop without market research.]]></page><page Index="675"><![CDATA[23

                   Executive summary
                   The executive summary is a “skeleton” of your report. It serves as a summary for the busy

               executive or a preview for the in-depth reader. It provides an overview of the most useful
               information, including the conclusions and recommendations. The executive summary should
               be very carefully written, conveying the information as concisely as possible. It should briefly

               cover the general subject of the research, the scope of the research (what the research covers/
               does not cover), identification of the methods used (i.e., a mail survey of 1,000 homeowners),

               conclusions, and recommendations.
               Background of the Study
                       This section should outline the background to the market research problem that the

               students  are  seeking  to  solve.  Include  background  information  on  the  market  to  provide
               context, as well as circumstances that have led to the need for such research. Background

               should be limited to 200 words at most, with most of the word count dedicated to the market
               circumstances and challenges surrounding the research.
               Research Objectives

                       In this section, the  researchers  will  identify  the research  objectives  of  their market
               research topic. The researchers should observe the following guidelines in presenting the
               objectives:

                       1.  Limit to 3-5 key objectives that must be met for the research to be considered a
                          success;
                       2.  Ensure each objective is SMART: specific, measurable, achievable, relevant and

                          time-bound;
                       3.  Keep objectives simple and within the remit of the specific research project which

                          is being outlined. Should be written in future tense;
                       4.  focus on the decisions/ initiatives that the research will inform rather than results;
                          and

                       5.  Refrain from listing expected outcomes or hypotheses.
               Research Method

                       The  method  describes,  in  as  much  detail  as  necessary,  how  you  conducted  the
               research, who (or what) your subjects were, and what tools or methods were used to achieve
               your  objectives.  In  most  cases,  the  method  section  does  not  need  to  be  long.  It  should,

               however, provide the essential information your reader needs to understand how the data
               were collected and how the results were achieved. It should be detailed enough that the data
               collection could be replicated by others for purposes of reliability. In other words, the method

               section should be clear enough that other researchers could conduct a similar study.]]></page><page Index="677"><![CDATA[25


                       Sample plan
                       This section includes the description of the sample that the students wish to research.

               The descriptions should draw on behavioral, psychographics, geographic, and demographic
               factors.
                       The sample plan should be used to indicate the number of participants they wish to

               research as well as the breakdown of each group. This will be affected by the choice to use
               qualitative, quantitative or multi-method approaches, as well as the estimated size of the target

               population.
                       Data collection
                       This section should contain listing of different parameters or information that will be

               gathered including techniques, instrument or mathematical formula/equation needed to get
               the correct data to be used in the research.

               Key Findings

                     The results section is the most important portion of your report. Some researchers prefer

               to use the term findings. This section should logically present the findings of your research

               and may be organized around the research objectives for the study. The results should be

               presented in narrative form and accompanied by tables, charts, figures, and other appropriate

               visuals that support and enhance the explanation of results. Tables and figures are supportive

               material; they should not be overused or used as filler. Each should contain a number and title


               and should be referred to in the narrative. Outline your results section before you write the

               report. The survey questionnaire itself can serve as a useful aid in organizing your results

               because the questions are often grouped in a logical order or in purposeful sections. Another

               useful method  for  organizing  your results  is  to  individually  print  all  tables  and figures  and

               arrange them in a logical sequence. Once you have the results outlined properly, you are


               ready to write the introductory sentences, definitions (if necessary), review of the findings

               (often referring to tables and figures), and transition sentences to lead into the next topic.

               Conclusion and Recommendation

                   Conclusions  and  recommendations  may  be  listed  together  or  in  separate  sections,

               depending on the amount of material you have to report. In any case, you should note that

               conclusions  are  not  the  same  as  recommendations.  Conclusions  are  the  outcomes  and

               decisions you have reached based on your research results. For example, if the data show]]></page><page Index="678"><![CDATA[26


               the order of preference for five car models, a conclusion would be: “Model C had the highest

               preference.” Recommendations are suggestions for how to proceed based on the conclusions.

               For  example,  “The  company  should  produce  and  market  Model  C.”  Unlike  conclusions,

               recommendations  may  require  knowledge  beyond  the  scope  of  the  research  findings


               themselves—that is, information on conditions within the company or industry, for example.

                                          Research Report Technical Details

                       In order to ensure uniformity, all market research manuscripts will adopt the following
               formats:
               Paper and Printing

                       Manuscripts, documents and papers will be computer-generated and compiled in white
               bond paper, A4 size (21 cm x 29.7 cm).

               Font Style and Size
                       Arial font style and size 11 will be used in all manuscripts, documents and papers.
               Smaller than font size 11 may be used in tables with several entries.

               Margin and Spacing
                       The left margin of each of the manuscripts should be used 1.5 inches (3.81 cm), while

               top,  bottom  and right margins  should  be  1  inch  (2.54  cm)  each.  Kindly  see figure  5.3 for
               example.

                       Paragraph  indention  should  be  five  spaces  (one  tab)  from  the  left  margin.  Within
               chapter headings and the paragraph that follows, three single spaces will be observed. The
               majority of them have to be double spaced. For a guide, look at the figure below.]]></page><page Index="680"><![CDATA[28




















                                                 Figure 5.4. Illustration of line spacing

               Page Numbers
                       The page number is displayed at the top right corner of the paper. The first page of

               every chapter is supposed to have imaginary page numbers.
               Tables

                       The title of the tables will provide a concise overview of table entries. Table titles adopt
               the capitalization of the sentence. Using a single space between the title of table and the table
               itself. For long table titles, the succeeding lines should be in hanging indention.

                       In tables containing several levels of headings, the first level is in ALL CAPS, while the
               second and following levels will be upper- and lower-case fonts.

                       Units of quantity will be enclosed in parentheses directly after the column heading.
               Table entries should be organized in rows and columns either single or two spaces.
                       Tables must be inserted inside the text or on a different page immediately after they've

               been introduced; should be numbered consecutively Arabic numerals. Use 1 point line for all
               horizontal lines, there should be no vertical lines; 1.5 spaces between entries.
                       Tables need not be separated as frequently as possible. When the tables are split into

               individual pages, the next half of the tables will be entitled (see Figure 5.5).]]></page><page Index="681"><![CDATA[29

















                                                   Figure 5.5 Sample table


               Figures
                       Figures may appear in the form of pictures, drawings, diagrams, portraits, blue prints,
               maps, graphs and charts.  Figures should be quick and easy enough to be interpreted without

               reading the captions.
                       Figures  should  be  printed  directly  in  the  document  and  not  glued  or  pasted.   The

               captions will be positioned under the bottom of the figure between two single spaces  and
               centered within the figure. If the figure is taken from references, the source should be cited in
               the parenthesis after the captions.

               Number, Figures and Symbols
                       As a basic guideline, spell out figures from one to nine. Ten and above should be

               actually written as numbers.
                       Examples:
                                  1-9        Three sari-sari stores         Nine stores
                             10 and above    20 female participants      10 luxury brands


                       Note: Avoid beginning a sentence with a figure. If really need to do so, the number
               should be written out (for example: fourteen respondents were . . . .)
                       Reminders:

                       Number are spelled out if you used cardinals (e.g. fourth, fifth), used fractions (e.g.
               three fourth), used to express indefinite and approximate period of time (e.g. one hundred

               years ago). Don’t use the symbol “%” instead, spell out the word “percent” in the text. You can
               only use the symbol “%” when enclosed in parenthesis or in tabulations.
                       You will use the numbers in the paragraph as long as it is expression of time (e.g. 4:00

               a.m.), telephone number, amount of money, plate numbers and age.]]></page><page Index="682"><![CDATA[30


               Abbreviations
                       As a general guideline, parenthesis acronyms and abbreviated terms can only appear

               on their very first reference in the paragraph.
               Spelling
                       The  revised  edition  of  the  Standard  English  dictionary  will  be  checked  in  order  to

               evaluate the appropriate spelling of words. The spelling should be consistent in the text.
               Tenses

                       The  present  tense  is  usually  used  to  express  hypotheses,  philosophies,
               generalizations and assumptions. The present tense is often used to describe the effects of
               the results of the study. The past tense is used to explain the outcome of the analysis.

               References
                       Below is the example of how references look like in the actual paper.

                                           Conducting Secondary Research

                     Primary research is initial research conducted by you (or someone you hire) to gather
               data  directly  for  your  current  objective.  You  may  be  conducting  a  survey,  conducting  an
               interview or a focus group, observing behavior, or conducting an experiment. You should be

               the  one  who  actually  obtains  this  raw  data  that  will  be  obtained  primarily  for  the  current
               research  needs.  Secondary  research,  on  the  other  side,  involves searching for  existing
               data that  was  originally  obtained  by  someone  else.  You  may  want  to  search  in  papers,

               archives, or go to web sites like the census. You will apply what you find to your current
               assessment in your research problem, but the data you find was not initially gathered by you,
               nor was it obtained for the purpose you are using it for.

                   Examples of secondary research are:
                       •  Journal articles
                       •  textbooks
                       •  dictionaries and encyclopedias
                       •  dissertations]]></page><page Index="683"><![CDATA[31


                       •  newspaper editorial/opinion pieces
                       •  criticism of literature, art works or music
                       •  Magazine articles

                       Secondary research for existing data is always the first choice for researchers as it
               saves time and money. However, secondary data should only be used if the data are relevant

               and relate appropriately to the problem. The data should also be credible, timely, accurate and
               affordable. Ensuring the usability of secondary data is the responsibility of researchers. Data
               used by the researcher should not only deal with the consumer market segment or the product

               category, they must be relevant by specifically addressing what researchers need to know.
               With vast amounts of information available online, it is relatively easy to find data. However,

               researchers must take the time and effort to verify the credibility of sources of data to ensure
               these come from reputable organizations or publications. If the source is a website it can be
               more  difficult  to  determine  creditability.  Researchers  must  verify  which  individual  or

               organization is responsible for the content of a website. Besides the relevance and credibility
               of a source, researchers should determine the date when a study was published, as the data
               should be timely. What is considered outdated depends on the product or consumer groups

               being studied. Fashion and technology information becomes dated very quickly. In other fields,
               the opposite is true.

                       When evaluating the accuracy of data, a researcher should ascertain who it was who
               originally  collected  the  data  included  in  a  study.  It  is  not  necessary  to  know  researchers
               personally, but it is necessary to know that the specific organization for which researchers

               collected the data is reputable. How the data were collected should also be examined. Data
               that have been collected using the wrong method or a flawed sample will result in erroneous
               results. Finally, the cost of the data should be considered. Even the best data cannot be used

               if they cannot be afforded.
               Uses of Secondary Data

                       There are so many uses of secondary data that it is rare for a marketing research
               project to be conducted without including some of this information. Some projects may be

               based  exclusively  on  secondary  data.  The  applications  of  secondary  data  range  from
               predicting broad changes in a culture’s “way of life” to specific applications, such as selecting

               a street address location for a new car wash. Decision Analyst, Inc., a marketing research
               firm,  has  a  Web  site  entirely  devoted  to  secondary  data.  Suggested  applications  include
               economic-trend  forecasting,  corporate  intelligence,  international  data,  public  opinion,  and

               historical data, among others. Marketers are interested in knowing secondary data in terms of
               demographic data to help them forecast the size of the market in a newly proposed market
               territory. A researcher may use secondary data to determine the population and growth rate

               in almost any geographical area. Government agencies are interested in knowing secondary]]></page><page Index="684"><![CDATA[32


               data to guide public policy decisions. The Department of Education needs to know how many
               five-year-old will enter the public-school system each year. Health care planners need to know

               how many senior citizens will be eligible for Medicare during the next decade.
                       Sometimes  secondary  data  can  be  used  to  evaluate  market  performance.  For
               example, since gasoline and fuel taxes collected per gallon are available in public records,

               petroleum marketers can easily determine the volume of fuels consumed in a country, thus
               making market share calculations easy and reliable. Articles are written on virtually every topic,

               and this storehouse of secondary data is available to marketers who want to understand a
               topic more thoroughly even though they themselves may not have firsthand experience. A
               wealth  of  secondary  data  is  available  concerning  the  lifestyles  and  purchasing  habits  of

               demographic groups. Since the people in these demographic groups tend to make similar
               purchases and have similar attitudes, they have been scrutinized by marketers.

                Chapter Learning Outcomes
                By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:
                1. discuss the unique factors to consider when developing a participant profile;

                2. develop a participant profile using segmentation characteristics; and
                3. construct a sample using probability and non-probability sampling.



                   Choosing Participants using Segmentation Characteristics to Develop a Profile
                        Consumers  are  at  the  heart  of  the  marketing  concept  and the marketing  mix  of
                 product,  price,  place  and  promotion  is  designed  to  attract  a  specific  market  segment.

                 Therefore,  it  is  not  surprising  that  participants  for  research  studies  are often  chosen  to
                 match  the  characteristics  of  a  company’s  current  or  potential  target market segment  of

                 consumers. Of course the company will want to know more about what this segment of
                 current or potential customers feels about issues such as their marketing mix for current
                 products or about new product ideas.

                        One  method  to  begin  the  process  of  developing  the  participant  profile  for  a
                 qualitative research study is to start with segmentation characteristics. The main bases for

                 segmentation  are  demographic,  psychographic,  usage  and  geographic.  The  research
                 question will provide information as to who should be included in the research sample.

                 Choosing participants based on Demographics
                        Probably the easiest place to start developing the participant profile would be to

                 define the potential research study sample participants by demographics.
                        Products that are specifically designed for one gender may require a group that
                 consists of men only. For example, a company might wish to expand their skin lotion product

                 line with a product designed specifically for men. However, even if the product is for men,
                 if  potential  purchasers  will  include  women  they  may  also  need  to  be  included  in  the

                 participant profile. The age of potential research participants also needs to be considered.
                 Once again, this may be determined by the research question. If it specifically asks about
                 the opinions and attitudes of younger or older consumers, then those participants must be

                 chosen with their age in mind. Likewise groups should be composed of participants from
                 the relevant income, education and ethnicity groups specified by research question.

                        If a research study does not specify that a certain gender, age, education, income
                 or  ethnicity  is  relevant,  participants  should  be  chosen  to  represent  as  many  of  these
                 characteristics  as  possible.  Researchers  might  learn  (when  analyzing  the  data)  what

                 demographic characteristics are actually relevant to the research question.
                 Psychographic Characteristics

                        Psychographic characteristics, on the other hand, are not so easy to determine.
                 However,  they  may  be  even  more  important  in  choosing  research  participants  than

                 demographics.  Psychographic  characteristics  focus  on  a  consumer’s  lifestyle,  including
                 their  opinions,  interests  and  attitudes.  These  are  more  often  the  characteristics  that

                 influence consumer purchases than demographic factors. A consumer lifestyle, such as an
                 interest in extreme sports, may still predominately attract a specific demographic group
                 such as young males.

                        Marketers  know  that  it  is  lifestyle  that  often  influences  the  choice  of  a  product.
                 Therefore, a participant profile for qualitative research is often chosen based on lifestyle

                 choice. In fact, the trend now is to segment even more finely.
                 Geographic Characteristics

                        Researchers  may  consider  geographic  location  when  developing  a  participant
                 profile based on product availability. If the product to be researched is only available in

                 specific geographic locations, then the research subjects must also come from these areas.
                 For  example,  if  researchers  are  conducting  a  study  on  consumer  motivation  when
                 purchasing  a  locally  brewed  beer,  the  potential  research  participants  will  need  to  be

                 recruited from the area where that beer is sold. To motivate potential research subjects to
                 participate in the research, they will need to perceive the location as being convenient.]]></page><page Index="687"><![CDATA[35


                 Therefore the distance a potential participant might be willing to travel would need to be
                 considered when developing the profile.

                 Usage Characteristics

                        Another aspect of usage to consider as part of a participant profile is product loyalty.
                 Sometimes researchers may describe the participant profile as consumers who are new,

                 lapsed  or  frequent  product  users.  These  characteristics  cannot  be  determined  without
                 occasional screening questions about the type of product usage. Therefore, the screening
                 questionnaire must ask if a potential participant is familiar with the product, their level of

                 usage and if they have used competing products.



                                       Probability and Non-Probability Sampling
                Probability Sampling

                        Probability sampling uses techniques that result in an ability to calculate exactly the
                probability  of  a  single  person  in  a  sampling  frame  being  chosen  to  participate.  This
                probability is based on the number of total people in that sample divided by the number of

                total people in the population. If the population is a known number this is quite easy to
                calculate. A survey that includes 250 people, out of a population of 1,000, means that every
                individual in the population has a 25 per cent probability of being included. The methods of

                conducting probability sampling include simple, stratified, systematic, and cluster. Of course
                for most research studies the total number of people who are in a population at any given

                moment  is  unknown.  Probability  sampling  can  still  be  conducted  with  the  probability
                calculated based on a reasonable estimate of the entire population.
                        The methods of probability sampling from which researchers can choose include

                simple,  stratified,  systemic  and  cluster.  These  vary  in  the  randomness  of  the  resulting
                sample. They also vary in their complexity and the time and effort it will take to construct a

                sample.
                    Simple random sampling
                        The most easily understood method is simple random sampling. In this method each

                sampling unit has an equal chance of being chosen to participate in the research study. The
                probability can be calculated by dividing the number of people in that sample by the total
                number of people in the population.

                    Systematic sampling
                        Even though it is a much simpler method to use, systematic sampling will result in a

                sample  that  is  almost  random.  In  systematic  sampling,  after  the  population  has  been
                determined,  all  units  in  the  population  are  listed  and  counted.  A  skip  interval  is  then
                calculated by dividing the total population by the sample size and this interval is used to

                choose who will be included in the sample. At first glance this may seem to be as random
                as simple sampling, but this is not so.

                                                          Population Size (N)
                                            Skip Interval =
                                                            Sample Size (n)
                    Stratified sampling

                        Stratified  sampling  is  used  when  researchers  believe  that  answers  will  vary
                depending on the demographic, psychographic, geographic or usage characteristics of each
                person in a population. There are two main reasons for choosing a stratified sample. First

                of all the population may be skewed in such a way that it is difficult to obtain a random
                sample using either a random or systematic method. In this case, stratified sampling is used
                to  increase  the  randomness  of  the  sample.  Second,  the  research  study  may  call  for

                comparing results between specific groups within a population. The main reason for using
                stratified  sampling  is  to  ensure  that  any  differences  are  diminished  by  the  sampling

                procedure. Another reason is when the research study is designed to learn more about
                differences between groups. Most populations can be divided into smaller groups based on
                shared characteristics.

                        Using a stratified sample allows marketing researchers to examine each of the strata
                separately. Initially, researchers must decide how many participants will be chosen from the

                population as a whole. After that researchers must decide on how to distribute the number
                of total participants among the different strata.
                    Cluster sampling

                        Cluster sampling also divides populations into groups. However, cluster sampling
                differs by reason of why a population is divided and the number of resulting groups. In
                cluster sampling a population is divided into many groups. Rather than being different, the

                aim  of  the  resulting  groups  is  that  each  will  include  individuals  who  represent  the  total
                population.  The  purpose  of  cluster  sampling  is  to  economically  and  efficiently  obtain  a
                sample  from  a  large  population  that  provides  an  accurate  representation  of  an  entire

                population. Such a method could also be combined with other sampling methods to form
                subgroups.]]></page><page Index="689"><![CDATA[37


                Non-Probability Sampling
                        Non-probability sampling uses a technique where each potential subject does not

                have the same probability of being included. The sample size and the specific participants
                are  determined  regardless  of  the  total  population.  The  methods  of  conducting  non-
                probability sampling include convenience, judgment, snowball and quota.

                    Convenience sampling
                        Convenience sampling is used when researchers choose any willing and available

                individuals as participants. This method can be implemented when it is known that a specific
                location  tends  to  attract  the  type  of  individual  needed  for  that  research  study.  The
                recruitment of participants can then take place in this location as it is where people who

                meet the profile tend to congregate.
                    Snowballing

                        Another  method  of  choosing  participants  is  called  ‘snowball’  sampling.  With  this
                method  researchers  choose  the  first  participant  to  match  the  participant  profile.  This
                participant then refers others with similar characteristics. The theory for using this system is

                that  the  first  participant  is  more  likely  to  know  someone  like  themselves  than  the
                researchers. This method is appropriate when the research calls for participants who may
                be from psychographic or ethnic groups that are very different to those of the researchers.

                There are two reasons for using snowballing. Firstly, researchers may not have a knowledge
                of  the  relevant  participants.  Secondly,  even  if  they  did,  potential  participants  may  not
                respond to an invitation from the researchers to participate.

                    Quota sampling
                        A simpler and cheaper means of obtaining a representative sample is to set a quota

                for  the  interviewers  to  achieve  one  that  mirrors  that  of  the  population  that  is  being
                researched.  Filling  the  quota  will  provide  a  mix  of  respondents  that  is  reflective  of  the
                population that is being targeted. In effect the choice of respondents in a quota sample is

                left to interviewers (unlike the case with pre-selected random samples) providing they fill the
                quotas to ensure the overall sample is representative, in key parameters, of the population

                being researched.
                    Judgment or purposive sampling
                        The research question will define the characteristics of the participant profile. It is

                important that the participants chosen match this profile so that they have the necessary
                common experiences which will result in useful research data. If input is needed from more
                than  one  type  of  research  subject,  then  more  than  one  participant  profile  should  be

                developed and two groups of potential subjects will need to be recruited. The process of
                using purposive sampling first includes establishing the participant profile. Then a list of]]></page><page Index="690"><![CDATA[38


                potential  research  subjects  is  identified  that  have  the  needed  characteristics  and
                knowledge. Finally, specific individuals from this list are asked to participate. Researchers

                may sometimes need to find participants for more than one type of methodology: it is not
                uncommon for large companies to conduct more than one type of qualitative research at a
                time.

                                       In-Depth, Intercept and Expert Interviews
                 Type of Interviews

                        The  choice  of  marketing  research  interviewing  methodologies  includes  in-depth
                 interviews.  With  this  technique  a  researcher  spends  most  of  the  interview  exploring
                 consumer motivation and behavior. Expert interviews are used to gather information from

                 people who are not necessarily direct consumers of a specific product, but have knowledge
                 of either that product and industry or the needs and wants of the market segment that is

                 being targeted. Intercept interviews are short person-on-the-street interviews that only ask
                 a few predetermined questions. This information can be used to develop hypotheses that
                 can then be proved or disproved by using quantitative research.

                    •  In-depth: one-to-one on a single topic for an extended period
                    •  Expert: with a person other than the research subject to obtain facts

                    •  Intercept or person-on-the-street: short interviews with many participants
                        In-depth interviews
                        In-depth interviews are conducted between an interviewer and a single participant.

                 The interview is partially structured with some of the questions being predetermined. These
                 questions are written by researchers and based on the research question. A researcher will

                 ask other questions based on information provided by the participants during the interviews.
                 In-depth interviews usually last a little under an hour and go through four phases: opening,
                 questioning, probing and closing.]]></page><page Index="692"><![CDATA[40

                        Expert interviews
                        Expert  interviews  are  usually  conducted  early  on  in  the  research  process  as  a
                 means  of  clarifying  a  research  problem.  They  can  also  be  used  to  gather  data  during

                 research,  but  only  in  combination  with  other  research  methods.  An  expert  interview  is
                 conducted  to  gather  factual  information  about  a  problem  from  someone  with  a  specific
                 product,  consumer  or  industry  knowledge.  Because  this  expert  is  usually  a  busy

                 professional, the time for an interview is kept as short as possible. The expert interview
                 consists  of  only  two  phases  –  opening  and  questioning.  Because  the  purpose  of  the

                 interview is to gain factual information, and not the underlying causes of behavior, probing
                 is not used. This also allows for the interview to be conducted in a shorter time.

                                         (The researcher explains the purpose of the research with a nutritionist

                 Closing phase           Thanks for participation.


                        Intercept interviews
                        Person-on-the-street interviews also ask open-ended questions. In this case though
                 the interview is kept very short. An intercept interview should only take a few minutes and

                 is therefore limited to three or four questions. The participants are chosen and interviewed
                 at the location where they can be found. This technique is often used when the subjects

                 needed  for  the  research  are  unwilling  to  agree  to  an  in-depth  interview.  Because  the
                 interviews take a short period of time, many more can be conducted. However, the short
                 time  period  for  person-on-the-street  interviews  means  that  there  isn’t  time  for  probing

                 questions. Therefore interviewers used for this type of interview does not need the same
                 level of technical skill. Instead, it is more important that the potential participants view the

                 interviewer as someone who is friendly and approachable. Below is an example of how
                 intercept interviews are used in researching fashions trends.]]></page><page Index="693"><![CDATA[41

                              Projective, Observational and Ground Theory Techniques
                Projective Techniques

                        Projective  techniques  are  used  to  encourage  communication  using  nonverbal
                methods  of  response.  They  include  completion  tasks  and  other  techniques  such  as
                component  sorts  and  thematic  appreciation  tests.  These  techniques  elicit  information

                through  writing,  drawing  and  a  variety  of  ways  other  than  answering  verbally.  These
                techniques, borrowed from psychology, are gaining increased use in marketing. The aim of
                such projective techniques is to gain insights from participants of which they may not be

                totally aware
                    Types of projective techniques
                        There are many different projective techniques that researchers can use individually

                or in combination with other research methods. These are creative tools that are especially
                appealing to researchers working in nonprofit organizations and creative industries. The

                most  common  projective  techniques  are  completion  tasks,  such  as  word  associations,
                sentence and story completion, and cartoons. More advanced projective techniques include
                thematic appreciation and component sorts. Creative researchers may even develop their

                own  techniques.  Many  projective  techniques  involve  the  completion  of  a  task  that  a
                researcher has begun. Such techniques allow participants to describe an experience in their

                own words but without speaking. These tasks include sentence or story completion. If a
                researcher feels that participants will not find the tasks too challenging, they can also include
                advertisement  completion  and  product  design.  Even  more  creative  would  be  for  a
                researcher to ask participants to prepare the copy for an ad about a specific product that

                would motivate them to make that purchase. If the product under research is an experience,
                the participants might be asked to construct what they consider to be an ideal event or

                performance. Other projective techniques include the thematic appreciation test, which uses
                photos to elicit responses, and component sorts where words and ideas are placed on cards
                which participants are then asked to associate with products and segments. All of these

                tasks allow participants to provide information about products without using themselves as
                subjects, which in turn allows them to reveal information in a non-threatening manner.]]></page><page Index="694"><![CDATA[42

                Observational Research

                        Another  research  method  that  can  be  used  by  organizations  is  observation.
                Observational research is based on analyzing what people do rather than what they say.
                The research is conducted without communicating with people, but rather by noting their

                behavior. Observational research is being conducted in new ways as technology is now
                making it possible to ‘observe’ using the internet, scanner-tracking, video and neuroimaging
                    Types of observations

                        There are three distinct types of observational research. When using the complete
                observer approach, research subjects will not be aware they are under observation. Using

                another type of observational research, researchers will participate in the behavior at the
                same time as they are observing. A third approach is for researchers to completely immerse
                themselves in a behaviour.

                Grounded Theory
                        Most research starts with a theory of why people behave the way that they do. A
                research methodology is then designed to test whether this theory is correct. Grounded

                theory starts with the opposite approach. Rather than the researchers first establishing a
                theory and then observing the behavior to determine if they are correct, the researchers
                observe the behavior to determine a theory. Conducting grounded theory is useful when the

                consumer behavior to be studied involves social interaction.
                        Grounded theory, like ethnography, involves research that takes place in the ‘field’

                or where a specific consumer behavior is taking place. What is unique about grounded
                theory is that the analysis does not wait until after the research has been conducted. Instead,
                the analysis of the data takes place on an ongoing basis. As a result of this analysis, the

                next subject observation or interview question will be adjusted. Thus, theory is built from the
                ground up rather than imposed from above.]]></page><page Index="695"><![CDATA[43


                                                 Questionnaire Design
                Basic Concepts in Measurement

                        Measurement is determining a description or amount of some property of an object
                that  is  of  interest  to  the  researcher.  For  instance,  a  marketing  manager  may  want  to
                determine what brand a person typically purchases or how much of the product he or she

                uses in a certain time period. This information, once compiled, can help answer specific
                research objectives such as determining product opinions and usage.

                        But what are we really measuring? We are measuring properties— sometimes called
                characteristics,  attributes,  or  qualities—of  objects.  Objects  include  consumers,  brands,
                stores, advertisements, or whatever construct is of interest to the researcher working with a

                particular manager. Properties are the specific features or characteristics of an object that
                can be used to distinguish it from another object. For example, assume the object we want

                to research is a consumer. The properties of interest to a manager who is trying to define
                who buys a specific product are a combination of demographics, such as age and gender,
                as well as buyer behavior, which includes such things as the buyer’s preferred brand and

                perceptions  of  various  brands.  Once  the  object’s  designation  on  a  property  has  been
                determined, we say that the object has been measured on that property.
                        Measurement underlies marketing research to a great extent because researchers

                are keenly interested in describing marketing phenomena. Furthermore, researchers are
                often given the task of finding relevant differences in the profiles of various customer types,
                and measurement is a necessary first step in this task. Measurement is a simple process

                as  long  as  we  are  measuring  objective  properties,  which  are  physically  verifiable
                characteristics such as age, income, number of bottles purchased, store last visited, and so

                on. They are observable and tangible. Typically, objective properties such as gender are
                preset as to appropriate response options, such as “male” or “female.” However, marketing
                researchers  often  desire  to  measure  subjective  properties,  which  cannot  be  directly

                observed because they are mental constructs such as a person’s attitude or intentions.
                Subjective  properties  are  unobservable  and  intangible.  In  this  case,  the  marketing

                researcher  must  ask  a  respondent  to  translate  his  or  her  feelings  or  opinions  onto  a
                measurement continuum, which is not an easy task. To do this, the marketing researcher
                must  adapt  or  develop  rating  scale  formats  that  are  very  clear  and  used  identically  by

                respondents. This process is known as scale development, which is designing questions
                and response formats to measure the subjective properties of an object.
                        Types of measures

                        Nominal measures are defined as those that use only labels; that is, they possess
                only the characteristic of description. Examples include designations as to race, religion,]]></page><page Index="696"><![CDATA[44


                type of dwelling, gender, brand last purchased, and buyer/nonbuyer. Answers involve yes–
                no, agree–disagree, or any other instance in which the descriptors cannot be differentiated

                except qualitatively. If you describe respondents in a survey according to their occupation—
                banker, doctor, computer programmer—you have used a nominal scale. Note that these
                examples  of  a  nominal  scale  only  label  the  consumers.  They  do  not  provide  other

                information such as “greater than,” “twice as large,” and so forth.
                        Ordinal  measures  permit  the  researcher  to  rank  order  the  respondents  or  their

                responses. For instance, if the respondent is asked to indicate his or her first, second, third,
                and fourth choices of brands, the results are ordinally scaled. Similarly, if one respondent
                checks the category “Commute regularly” on a travel-frequency scale and another checks

                the category “Commute infrequently,” the result is an ordinal measurement because we
                know that the first respondent commutes more than the second one, but not by how much.

                Ordinal scales indicate only relative size differences among objects: greater than, less than,
                or equal to.
                        Scale measures are those in which the distance between each level is known. There

                are two types of scale measures. Ratio scale measures are ones in which a true zero origin
                exists— such as an actual number of purchases in a certain time period, dollars spent, miles
                traveled, number of children in the household, or years of college education. As you can

                see, ratio scales are easy for respondents to understand as they are in dollars, times, years,
                or some other familiar denomination. The ratio characteristic allows us to construct ratios
                when comparing results of the measurement. One person may spend twice as much as

                another or travel one-third as far. Interval scale measures are rating scales for subjective
                properties where, for adjacent levels, the distance is normally defined as one scale unit. For

                example, a coffee brand rated 3 in taste is one unit away from one rated 4. Implicitly, equal
                intervals exist between the level descriptors. That is, if you are asked to evaluate a store’s
                salespeople  by  selecting  a  single  designation  from  a  list  of  “extremely  friendly,”  “very

                friendly,”  “somewhat  friendly,”  “somewhat  unfriendly,”  “very  unfriendly,”  or  “extremely
                unfriendly,” the researcher probably assumes that each designation is one unit away from

                the preceding one. In these cases, we say that the scale is an assumed interval.
                        Interval scales may be intuitive for respondents, but they always measure subjective
                properties, and as you will soon learn, they require careful judgment on the part of the

                marketing researcher when used. Because most subjective, or psychological, properties
                exist on a continuum ranging from one extreme to another in the mind of the respondent, it
                is common practice to use interval scale questions to measure them. Sometimes numbers

                are used to indicate a single unit of distance between each position on the scale. Usually,
                but not always, the scale ranges from an extreme negative through a neutral and to an]]></page><page Index="697"><![CDATA[45


                extreme positive designation. The neutral point is not considered zero, or an origin; instead,
                it is considered a point along the continuum.

                        Interval scales commonly used in marketing research. It is not good practice to
                invent a novel scale format with every questionnaire. Instead, marketing researchers often

                fall  back  on  standard  types  used  by  the  industry.  By  now  you  know  that  marketing
                researchers often measure subjective properties of consumers. There are various terms
                and  labels  given  to  these  constructs,  including  attitudes,  opinions,  evaluations,  beliefs,

                impressions,  perceptions,  feelings,  and  intentions.  Because  these  constructs  are
                unobservable, the marketing researcher must develop some means of allowing respondents

                to  express  the  direction  and  intensity  of  their  impressions  in  a  convenient  and
                understandable manner. To do this, the marketing researcher uses interval scales. In this
                section, we will describe the basic interval scale formats that are most common in marketing

                research  practice.  You  will  find  these  scale  formats  time  and  again  on  questionnaires;
                hence, we refer to them as workhorse scales because they do the bulk of the measurement

                work in marketing research.
                        The Likert scale. An interval scale commonly used by marketing researchers is the
                Likert  scale,  in  which  respondents  are  asked  to  indicate  their  degree  of  agreement  or

                disagreement on a symmetric agree– disagree scale for each of a series of statements.
                That is, the scale captures the intensity of their feelings toward the statement’s claim or
                assertion  because  respondents  are  asked  how  much  they  agree  or  disagree  with  the

                statement. With this scale, it is best to use “flat” or plain statements and let the respondent
                indicate the intensity of his or her feelings by using the agree–disagree response continuum
                position.

                        Table 6.6 presents an example of its use in an online survey. The Likert type of
                response format, borrowed from a formal scale development approach introduced by Rensis

                Likert, has been extensively modified and adapted by marketing researchers, so much, in
                fact, that its definition varies from researcher to researcher. Some assume that any intensity
                scale using descriptors such as “strongly,” “somewhat,” and “slightly” is a Likert variation.

                Others use the term only for questions with agree–disagree response options. We tend to
                agree with the second opinion and prefer to refer to any scaled measurement other than an

                agree–disagree dimension as a “sensitivity” or “intensity” scale. But this convention is only
                our  preference,  and  you  should  be  aware  that  different  researchers  embrace  other
                designations. A special application of the Likert question form called the lifestyle inventory

                takes into account the values and personality traits of people as reflected in their unique
                activities, interests, and opinions (AIOs) toward their work, leisure time, and purchases.
                Examples of lifestyle statements are: “I shop a lot for specials,” “I prefer to pay for purchases

                with my debit card,” or “My children are an important part of my life.” Lifestyle questions
                measure consumers’ unique ways of living. These questions can be used to distinguish]]></page><page Index="699"><![CDATA[47


                among types of purchasers such as heavy versus light users of a product, store patrons
                versus non-patrons, or other customer types. They can assess the degree to which a person

                is, for example, price-conscious, fashion-conscious, an opinion giver, a sports enthusiast,
                child oriented, home centered, or financially optimistic. The technique was originated by
                advertising  strategists  who  wanted  to  obtain  descriptions  of  groups  of  consumers  as  a

                means of establishing more effective advertising. The underlying belief is that knowledge of
                consumers’  lifestyles,  as  opposed  to  just  demographics,  offers  direction  for  marketing

                decisions. Many companies use psychographics as a market targeting tool.


                    Table 6.6 Example of a Likert scale
                    Indicate the degree to which you agree or disagree with each of the following statements.












                    The Likert 5-point scale is flexible when it comes to measuring constructs or concepts.

                It  is  also  amenable  to  sophisticated  statistical  analysis  that  has  the  potential  to  reveal
                important relationships or associations among constructs.

                    The  semantic  differential  scale.  A  specialized  interval  scale  format  that  has  sprung
                directly  from  the  problem  of  translating  a  person’s  qualitative  judgments  into  metric
                estimates is the semantic differential scale. Like the Likert scale, this one has been borrowed
                from another area of research, namely, semantics. The semantic differential scale contains

                a  series  of  bipolar  adjectives  for  the  various  properties  of  the  object  under  study,  and
                respondents indicate their impressions of each property by indicating locations along its

                continuum. The focus of the semantic differential is on the measurement of the meaning of
                an object, concept, person, or experience. Because many marketing stimuli have meaning,
                mental  associations,  or  connotations,  this  type  of  synthetic  scale  works  well  when  the

                marketing  researcher  is  attempting  to  determine  brand,  store,  or  other  images.5  The
                construction of a semantic differential scale begins with the determination of a concept or

                object to be rated, usually a brand or company. The researcher then selects bipolar pairs of
                words or phrases that could be used to describe the object’s salient properties. Depending]]></page><page Index="700"><![CDATA[48


                on  the  object,  some  examples  might  be  “friendly–unfriendly,”  “hot–cold,”  “convenient–
                inconvenient,” “high quality–low quality,” or “dependable–undependable.” The opposites are

                positioned at the endpoints of a continuum of intensity, and it is customary to use five or
                seven separators between each point. The respondent then indicates his or her evaluation
                of the performance of the object, say, a brand, by checking the appropriate line. The closer

                the respondent checks to an end point on a line, the more intense is his or her evaluation of
                the object being measured.

                    Table  6.7  shows  a  semantic  differential  scale  for  a  survey  for  Red  Lobster.  The
                respondents also rated Jake’s Seafood Restaurant on the same survey. You can see that
                each respondent has been instructed to indicate his or her impression of various restaurants

                such  as  Red  Lobster  by  clicking  on  the  appropriate  circle  between  the  several  bipolar
                adjective  phrases.  As  you  look  at  the  phrases,  you  should  note  that  they  have  been

                randomly flipped to avoid having all of the “good” ones on one side. This flipping procedure
                is used to avoid the halo effect, 6 which is a general feeling about a store or brand that can
                bias a respondent’s impressions on its specific properties.

                    For instance, let’s say respondents who are big fans of Red Lobster complete a survey
                with all the positive items on the right-hand side and all the negative on the left-hand side;
                they might click on the answers on the right-hand side without reading each characteristic

                carefully. But it is entirely possible that some specific aspects of the Red Lobster dining
                experience  might  not  be  as  good  as  others.  Perhaps  the  restaurant  is  not  located  in a
                convenient  place,  or  the  menu  is  not  as  broad  as  some  might  like.  Randomly  flipping

                favorable and negative ends of the descriptors in a semantic differential scale minimizes the
                halo effect. Also, there is some evidence that when respondents are ambivalent about the

                survey topic, it is best to use a balanced set of negatively and positively worded questions.
                One of the most appealing aspects of the semantic differential scale is the ability of the
                researcher to compute averages and then to plot a “profile” of the brand or company image.

                Each check line is assigned a number for coding. Usually, the numbers 1, 2, 3, and so on,
                beginning  from  the  left  side,  are  customary.  Then,  because  a  metric  scale  is  used,  an

                average may be computed for each bipolar pair. The averages are plotted as you see them,
                and  marketing  researchers  have  a  nice  graphical  communication  vehicle  with  which  to
                report the findings to their clients.]]></page><page Index="701"><![CDATA[49

                    The stapel scale. A Stapel scale relies not on bipolar terms but on positive and negative numbers,
                typically ranging from +5 to –5. The scale may or may not have a neutral zero. The Stapel scale is
                easier to construct than a semantic differential scale because the researcher does not need to come
                up with bipolar adjectives for each attribute. It is also flexible to administer as respondents do not
                need to “see” the scale the way they do when responding to a semantic differential scale. However,

                to use a Stapel scale properly, respondents must feel comfortable with the use of negative numbers.

                                      measure  the  degree  of  dissatisfaction  (Completely  Dissatisfied;  Slightly
                                      Dissatisfied;  Neither  Dissatisfied  nor  Satisfied;  Slightly  Satisfied;  Completely

                                      Example: Based on your experience with Federal Express, how satisfied have
                                      you been with its overnight delivery service?


                Designing a Questionnaire
                        A questionnaire is the vehicle used to present the questions the researcher desires
                respondents  to  answer.  A  questionnaire  serves  six  key  functions:  (1)  It  translates  the

                research objectives into specific questions asked of respondents. (2) It standardizes those
                questions  and  the  response  categories  so  that  every  participant  responds  to  identical

                stimuli. (3) By its wording, question flow, and appearance, it fosters cooperation and keeps
                respondents motivated throughout the interview. (4) It serves as an enduring record of the
                research. (5) Depending on the data collection mode used, such as online, a questionnaire

                can speed up the process of data analysis. (6) Finally, it contains the information on which
                reliability and validity assessments may be made. In other words, questionnaires are used
                by  researchers  for  quality  control.  Given  that  it  serves  all  of  these  functions,  the

                questionnaire is at the center of the research process. In fact, studies have shown that
                questionnaire design directly affects the quality of the data collected. Even experienced
                interviewers cannot compensate for questionnaire defects. The time and effort invested in

                developing a good questionnaire are well spent.21 Designing a questionnaire requires the
                researcher to go through a series of interrelated steps.]]></page><page Index="703"><![CDATA[51



                Developing Questions

                        Question development is the practice of selecting appropriate response formats and
                wording  questions  that  are  understandable,  unambiguous,  and  unbiased.  Marketing
                researchers take great care in developing research questions that measure (1) attitudes, (2)

                beliefs,  (3)  behaviors,  and  (4)  demographics  because  they  desire  reliable  and  valid
                responses. Question development is absolutely vital to the success of the survey. Here is a

                corny example to make our point that question wording is crucial. How would you respond
                to the following question that might appear on a questionnaire? Are you trying to control
                your compulsive gambling?

                        ___ Yes ___ No
                        If you answer “Yes” or “No,” you are admitting to a gambling addiction. Either way,

                the conclusion is that everyone who took part in the survey gambles compulsively. But we
                all know that everyone is not a compulsive gambler, so the question wording must be flawed,
                and it surely is. A single word can make a difference in how study participants respond to a

                question,  and  there  is  considerable  research  to  illustrate  this  point.  For  example,
                researchers in one study let subjects view a picture of an automobile for a few seconds.
                Then, they asked a single question, but they changed one word. They asked, “Did you see

                the  broken  headlight?”  to  one  group  of  participants  and  asked,  “Did  you  see  a  broken
                headlight?” to another group. Only the “a” and the “the” were different, yet the question
                containing  the  “the”  produced  more  “don’t  know”  and  “Yes”  answers  than  did  the  “a”

                question. Our point is that as little as a one word in a question can result in question bias
                that will distort the survey findings.

                        Unfortunately, words that we use commonly in speaking to one another sometimes
                encourage  biased  answers  when  they  appear  on  a  questionnaire  because  their  literal
                interpretations are impossible to answer. For example, “Did you ever use a Laundromat?”

                means  anytime  in  your  lifetime;  “Did  you  have  any  concerns  about  your  cell  phone’s
                reception?”  means  absolutely  even  the  tiniest  concern,  and  “Do  you  always  buy  Bose

                products?”  means  every  time  without  fail.  These  commonly  used  words  are  extreme
                absolutes, meaning that they place respondents in a situation where they must either agree
                fully or they must completely disagree with the extreme position in the question.

                        Four dos of question wording. Question evaluation amounts to scrutinizing the
                wording of a question to ensure that question bias is minimized and that the question is
                worded so that respondents understand it and can respond to it with relative ease. As we

                noted earlier, question bias occurs when the phrasing of a question influences a respondent
                to answer wrongly or with other than perfect accuracy. Ideally, every question should be]]></page><page Index="704"><![CDATA[52


                examined  and  tested  according  to  a  number  of  crucial  factors  known  to  be  related  to
                question bias. To be sure, question evaluation is a judgment process, but we can offer four

                simple  guidelines,  or  “dos,”  for  question  wording.  We  strongly  advise  ensuring  that  the
                question is: (1) focused, (2) simple, (3) brief, and (4) crystal clear.

                        Focused on a single issue or topic. To the greatest extent possible, the researcher
                must stay focused on the specific issue or topic. For example, take the question “What type
                of hotel do you usually stay in when on a trip?” The focus of this question is hazy because

                it does not narrow down the type of trip or when the hotel is being used. For example, is it
                a business or a pleasure trip? Is the hotel at a place en route or at the final destination? A
                more focused version is “When you are on a family vacation, what type of destination hotel

                do  you  typically  use?”  As  a  second  example,  consider  how  “unfocused”  the  following
                question is: “When do you typically go to work?” Does this mean when do you leave home

                for work or when do you actually begin work once at your workplace? A better question
                would be “At what time do you ordinarily leave home for work?”
                        Brief.  Unnecessary  and  redundant  words  should  always  be  eliminated.  This

                requirement  is  especially  important  when  designing  questions  that  will  be  administered
                verbally, such as over the telephone. Brevity will help the respondent to comprehend the

                central question and reduce the distraction of wordiness. Here is a question that suffers
                from a lack of brevity: “What are the considerations that would come to your mind while you
                are confronted with the decision to have some type of repair done on the automatic icemaker

                in your refrigerator assuming that you noticed it was not making ice cubes as well as it did
                when you first bought it?” A better, brief form would be “If your icemaker was not working
                right, how would you correct the problem?” One source recommends that a question should

                be no more than 20 words long.
                        Grammatically simple. A simple sentence is preferred because it has only a single
                subject and predicate, whereas compound and complex sentences are busy with multiple

                subjects,  predicates,  objects,  and  complements.  The  more  complex  the  sentence,  the
                greater  the  potential  for  respondent  error.  With  more  conditions  to  remember,  the

                respondent’s attention may wane, or he or she may concentrate on only one part of the
                question. To avoid these problems, the researcher should strive to use only simple sentence
                structure—even if two separate sentences are necessary to communicate the essence of

                the question. Take the question “If you were looking for an automobile that would be used
                by the head of your household who is primarily responsible for driving your children to and

                from school, music lessons, and friends’ houses, how much would you and your spouse
                discuss the safety features of one of the cars you took for a test drive?” A simple approach
                is “Would you and your spouse discuss the safety features of a new family car?” followed]]></page><page Index="705"><![CDATA[53


                by (if yes) “Would you discuss safety ‘very little,’ ‘some,’ ‘a good deal,’ or ‘to a great extent’?”
                        Crystal clear. It is best to avoid words that are vague or open to misinterpretations.

                For example, the question “How many children do you have?” is unclear because it can be
                interpreted  in various  ways. One  respondent might  think  of  only those children  living  at
                home, whereas another might include children from a previous marriage. A better question

                is “How many children under the age of 18 live with you in your home?” To develop a crystal-
                clear question, the researcher may be forced to slightly abuse the previous guideline of

                simplicity, but with a bit of effort, question clarity can be obtained with an economical number
                of words. One author has nicely summarized this guideline: “The question should be simple,
                intelligible, and clear.”

                        Four  don’ts  of  question  wording.  In  four situations  question  bias  is  practically
                assured. An awareness of these problem areas can help avoid them or spot them when you

                are reviewing a questionnaire draft. Specifically, the question should not be (1) leading, (2)
                loaded, (3) double-barreled, or (4) overstated.
                        Do  not  “lead”  the  respondent to  a  particular  answer.  A  leading  question  gives  a

                strong  cue  or  expectation  as  what  answer  to  provide.  Therefore,  it  biases  responses.
                Consider this question: “Don’t you worry when using your credit card for online purchases?”
                The respondent is being led because the question wording insinuates that one should worry.

                Therefore, the question “leads” respondents to the conclusion that there must be some
                worries, and, therefore, they will likely agree with the question, particularly respondents who
                have no opinion. Rephrasing the question as “Do you have concerns when using your credit

                card for online purchases?” is a much more objective request of the respondent. Here the
                respondent is free—that is, not led—to respond “yes” or “no.”

                        Do not use “loaded” wording or phrasing. Whereas leading questions are typically
                obvious, loaded questions are stealthy. That is, a loaded question has buried in its wording
                elements a sneaky presupposition, or it might make reference to universal beliefs or rules

                of  behavior.  It  may  even  apply  emotionalism  or  touch  on  a  person’s  inner  fears.  Our
                compulsive gambling question was loaded because it presupposes that respondents have

                a  gambling  problem.  Some  researchers  refer  to  a  loaded  question  simply  as  a  “biased
                question.”  Identifying  bias  in  a  question  requires  thoughtful  judgment.  For  example,  a
                company  marketing  mace  for  personal  use  may  use  the  question,  “Should  people  be

                allowed to protect themselves from harm by using a Taser in self-defense?” Obviously, most
                respondents  will  agree  with  the  need  to  protect  oneself  from  harm,  and  self-defense  is
                acceptable, but these are loaded concepts because no one wants to be harmed and self-

                defense is only legal if one is attacked. Eliminating the loaded aspect of this question would
                result  in  the  question,  “Do  you  think  carrying  a  Taser  is  acceptable  for  someone  who]]></page><page Index="706"><![CDATA[54


                believes it is needed?” As you can see, the phrasing of each question should be examined
                thoroughly to guard against the various sources of question bias error. With the new wording

                of the question in our example, we do not load it by mentioning harm or self-defense.
                        Do not use a “double-barreled” question. A double-barreled question is really two
                different questions posed in one question. With two questions posed together, it is difficult

                for a respondent to answer either one directly. Consider a question asked of patrons at a
                restaurant, “Were you satisfied with the restaurant’s food and service?” How do respondents

                answer? If they say “yes,” does it mean they were satisfied with the food? The service?
                Both? The survey would be much improved by asking two questions: one about the food
                and another about service

                        Do not use words that overstate the case. An overstated question places undue
                emphasis on some aspect of the topic. It uses what might be considered “dramatics” to

                describe the topic. Here is an example that might be found in a survey conducted for Ray-
                Ban sunglasses: “How much do you think you would pay for a pair of sunglasses that will
                protect  your  eyes  from  the  sun’s  harmful  ultraviolet  rays,  which  are  known  to  cause

                blindness?” As you can see, the overstatement concerns the effects of ultraviolet rays, and
                because of this overstatement, respondents may be compelled to think about how much
                they would pay for something that can prevent blindness and not about how much they

                would  really  pay  for  sunglasses.  A  more  toned-down  and  acceptable  question  wording
                would be, “How much would you pay for sunglasses that will protect your eyes from the
                sun’s glare?” Avoid using words that overstate conditions. It is better to present the question

                in a neutral tone rather than in a strong positive or negative tone.




                                                  Conducting Surveys

                The Survey Process
                        The  survey  process  is  similar  for  both  researcher-administered  and  self-

                administered  surveys.  First  the  research  question  must  be  written.  As  with  all  forms  of
                research this will be a team effort between researchers and management. The research
                question will help to determine the profile of the sample that will be needed to participate in

                the research. The next step will be to decide upon the method of conducting the survey,
                whether the method is researcher- or self-administered. The survey will then be written and
                tested. The times and locations for researcher-administered surveys must be chosen to

                meet  the  needs  of  participants.  For  self-administered  surveys,  the  dates  for  mailing  or
                emailing a survey will need to be decided. For researcher-administered surveys the next]]></page><page Index="707"><![CDATA[55


                step will be to identify staffing needs and hire and train the personnel who will conduct the
                survey. After the personnel are hired and trained, the survey can be conducted. For self-

                administered surveys, the survey is now mailed or the website is opened, after which a
                researcher will wait for the responses to be returned. Once the data have been returned –
                either by the survey taker, through the mail or electronically – the results are then analyzed

                and the report is written.

                    Conducting a survey
                        The survey process for both phone and personal surveys should proceed through
                the same steps. Survey takers should first be trained to introduce themselves and their

                organization.  They  then  should  explain  the  purpose  of  the  research  and  the  sample
                selection process. This information will be from a script written by the researchers. The

                survey takers should next determine eligibility with one or two screening questions. These
                can be as simple as asking if the person speaking is head of a household, or in a specific]]></page><page Index="708"><![CDATA[56


                age  range,  or  if  they  have  children  living  in  their  household.  After  eligibility  has  been
                determined  survey  takers  should  explain  the  length  of  the  survey  in  terms  of  the  time

                requirement,  not  the  number  of  questions  or  pages.  They  must  then  obtain  consent  to
                proceed with the survey. While the survey is being conducted, a survey taker should be
                prepared to explain confusing questions without leading a participant to provide any specific

                response.  Finally,  a  survey  taker  should  always  sincerely  thank  a  participant  for  their
                assistance.

                        There will be occasions when a survey taker contacts a potential participant who
                reacts to the request to participate in the survey with rudeness or even hostility. A survey
                taker should never respond back in kind, as it may damage the reputation of the organization

                conducting the research. Instead, a survey taker must remember not to take the response
                personally and simply move on to the next call. At times, some of these people may wish to
                speak to a supervisor, realizing that the survey taker is not the one responsible for the survey

                call. Supervisors should always be available to handle these calls and soothe any irate
                callers.

                                      Analysis of Qualitative vs Quantitative Data


                       The data from quantitative research are in the form of numbers that can be averaged,
               compared and contrasted. The resulting statistics are used to represent the level of a form of

               consumer  behavior  or  consumer  preference  within  a  targeted  population  segment.
               Management  may  not  understand  how  the  statistics  were  obtained,  but  they  can  easily
               understand the averages and percentages and, therefore, trust the resulting information. In

               contrast, qualitative research results in verbal data and images including recordings, written
               words  and  sometimes  photos  or  videos.  These  data  cannot  be  statistically  manipulated,

               compared  and  contrasted.  In  addition,  the  analysis  does  not  result  in  easily  understood
               percentages.
                       Rather than proving facts using statistics, the analysis of qualitative data has as its

               focus the search for meanings. This is because qualitative research is used to answer the
               question of “Why?” The answer will always be more complicated to explain to management
               than just a percentage or average. In fact, sometimes the reasons for consumer behavior that

               are uncovered through research can be quite surprising.

               The Process of Analyzing Qualitative Data
                       Data organization

                       Data organization involves both the collection and the transformation of the collected
               information. Organization of data according to research question can be particularly important
               for  qualitative  research,  as  the  findings  may  need  to  be  compared  with  the  findings  from

               quantitative data on the same subject (Harradine and Ross, 2007). Some of the data resulting
               from the research might be lists that have been collected on large pieces of paper.

                       Transcribe recordings
                       Qualitative interviews and focus groups will both result in tape recordings that will need
               to be transcribed. If possible, a word for word transcription should be produced. However, if

               there is a great deal of taped material this may not be economically feasible. It is best if the
               researcher who moderated the focus groups or conducted the interviews listens to the tape

               before transcription. While a researcher is actually conducting an interview or moderating a
               focus group, part of their awareness will have to be focused on that process.
                       Listening to the proceedings afterward they can simply focus on what is being said.

               Listening to the tape will refresh a researcher’s memory of what was said. In addition, the tone
               of voice used and even the silences between speech can provide insights.
                       After listening to the tape, transcribing the material is the next step in the analysis

               process. While a researcher is listening to a tape, they can be typing up notes on the main
               points being made. Once the transcription process starts, the researcher can pause the tape
               while they make notes on new insights or memories. For example, there may have been a

               focus  group  member  who  spoke  rarely  but  followed  the  proceedings  closely  with  evident
               interest. This gives more weight to his or her opinions than if the researcher remembered that

               the focus group participant seemed bored and distracted. It is difficult for researchers to take
               notes on behavior during a focus group or interview, as it can disrupt the proceedings and
               make  participants  feel  uncomfortable.  Therefore,  these  notes  should  be  added  to  the

               transcript.  The  same  or  different  participants  will  frequently  repeat  information,  and  a
               researcher can quickly pick up patterns and develop a shorthand notation process.

                       Transcribing tapes is much more than just a technical task, which is why it is best if a
               researcher prepares a transcript personally. The goal of transcription isn’t a word for word
               perfect  transcript.  Instead,  while  the  transcription  is  taking  place,  a  researcher  should

               concentrate  on  recording  information  that  addresses  the  research  question.  While  the
               conversation may stray and other topics be discussed, these topic areas are important only in
               how they relate to the main research question. For example, if the research concerns the cost

               of a product, such as cell phones, participants may start discussing where they like to shop. A
               researcher will then analyze this conversation for its relevance to the research question on]]></page><page Index="711"><![CDATA[59


               cost, by noting whether the stores mentioned are discount outlets or high-priced specialty
               stores. Information on a great sale on shoes that was added by one participant can be ignored.

                       When transcribing a tape, it is not important to note the names of speakers as they do
               not need to be identified personally. However, it is still important to attribute comments to
               individuals to determine if there is consistency in the comments, they provide throughout the

               focus group. Instead of names, a researcher can add a code or a number to represent each
               speaker. In addition, comments on tone of voice or emotion can be added using the same

               system.
                       One means of adding such detail is to type the transcript in a column format. The first
               column will have the words spoken during the session, whether interview or focus group. The

               second column will contain the researcher’s notes on who is speaking, their tone of voice and
               any other observations noticed by the researcher when the research was conducted. The third

               column will be used for coding purposes. Because this column transcript will be referred to
               frequently  during  the  analysis  process,  it  is  important  to  leave  additional  space  where
               handwritten comments can be added.

                       Coding qualitative data
                       Once data have been transcribed and reviewed, researchers will begin to code. Coding
               is used to note the repetition of ideas, opinions or facts. The first coding will be conducted to

               examine the data for answers to the research question. For example, the research question
               might have asked how a visit to the dentist could be made more pleasant. A focus group of
               clients would be asked for their ideas for improvements that could be made to a dental clinic.

               A transcript would be coded for the times when any mention of the ideas for improvements
               was  mentioned.  These  instances  are  coded  so  that  researchers  can  then  return  to  the

               information to analyze if many of the responses gave similar ideas or if any unique suggestions
               were provided. The transcribed notes will then be analyzed again to code other topics that
               arose  during  the  research.  For  example,  besides  discussing  ideas  for  improvements,

               researchers might find that on multiple occasions trouble reaching the dental office due to a
               lack  of  convenient  parking  or  public  transportation  options  was  mentioned.  Another  issue

               discussed might have been the services now offered at a new, competing, dental office. By
               coding these data, researchers may find that it is this new competition that received the most
               mentions.

                       Once researchers have finished coding for concepts, they may find that some need to
               be further broken down into categories. These concepts and categories are important as they
               are the building blocks from which researchers will make their recommendations for action.

               For example, many comments in a transcript may involve the concept of the price of a product.
               Several  participants  may  state  that  they  don’t  buy  a  product  unless  it  is  on  sale.  Other
               participants may state that they buy a competing product because it is cheaper, while some]]></page><page Index="712"><![CDATA[60


               may state directly that the price of a product is too high. While all of these involve the price of
               a product, a researcher may decide they are too dissimilar and break them down into three

               categories:  ‘don’t  buy  because  can’t  afford,  ‘competing  product  purchasers’,  and  ‘non-
               purchasers’. The researcher may then make different recommendations for attracting each of
               the first two groups and recommend no action on the third. Researchers can code transcripts

               using highlighting markers with a different color for each concept and category, or alternatively
               the concept and category name can be noted in the margins of a document. As researchers

               code the material for the answer to a research question, each time a researcher comes across
               a statement that deals with the issue of the price being more than a consumer is willing to pay
               this will be coded. However, with qualitative research there may be other concepts that arise

               that are worth noting (which is one of the benefits of qualitative research). For example, in the
               discussion on price, a researcher might note that several consumers expressed how much

               they enjoyed the design of the product. While the research question had not addressed the
               seasonality of price sensitivity, this would still be useful information for management.

                       Analysis of qualitative data content
                       After  the  data  have  been  organized,  transcribed  and  coded,  the  next  step  in  the

               process of analysis is to determine if there are any relationships between the concepts and
               categories. The purpose of developing relationships is to generate new ideas to answer a
               research question. These new ideas will be the basis for making recommendations for action.

               For example, one qualitative research study was used to examine the cultural effects of the
               country of origin of a product on British consumption behavior. As a result, it was noted that

               country of origin was important for some groups of products (Balestrini et al., 2003).
                       After all, management will want actionable recommendations from a study, not just
               analysis. A report that simply describes researchers’ impressions will not be considered useful

               enough to justify the cost of the research. Possible recommendations might involve how to
               target new types of consumer segments, descriptions of the process of consumer behaviors,
               a comparison and contrast of consumer motivation, or a hypothesis of a relation between

               variables that will need to be verified by future quantitative research.]]></page><page Index="713"><![CDATA[61


                       Coded  qualitative  research  data  can  be  analyzed  for  information  on  possible  new
               market segments to target. A company may be aware of how to market their product to their

               current demographic and geographic segments, but qualitative data might reveal entirely new
               psychographic segments of which that company was unaware. These new segments will have
               been identified based on common values and attitudes that have been verbalized or displayed

               during the qualitative research process. For example, a research focus group on a product for
               older  consumers  might  have  found  that  people  aged  65–75  years  old  do  not  consider

               themselves  as  being  older.  Because  they  are  still  leading  active  lives,  this  segmentation
               category based on age may have no meaning for them. Instead, they may identify themselves
               as ‘active adults’ who just happen to be retired or on their second career. They may also think

               that they have no attitudes in common with people in the traditional category called senior
               citizens.

                       Likewise, qualitative research data may uncover segments of individuals who identify
               with various types of hobbies. What they will all have in common is a specific interest, say in
               crafts,  and  will  therefore  identify  themselves  by  this,  for  example  as  crafters.  Qualitative

               research might also uncover new usage categories. In discussions of food consumption, it
               might be found that food ordinarily consumed at breakfast is also enjoyed at other times of the
               day. Based on a finding that cereal is also eaten at the office, researchers might recommend

               a new promotional campaign based on this usage.
                       Besides  new  market  segments,  qualitative  research  can  provide  insights  into
               consumer behavior processes. A company that makes readymade dinner entrées may be

               interested in the meal preparation processes of today’s busy dual career families. Analysis of
               ethnographic data might reveal that parents would like to have everyone sit down for meals

               together, but that children have their own diet preferences. Using this knowledge, researchers
               could recommend that a company produces prepackaged dinners with a choice of side dishes
               so that everyone can eat together and yet still have the food they each want. If it is found that

               parents still want to have their families maintain a little formality when dining, researchers
               might then recommend that the packaging includes decorative paper napkins.

                       An observational study on how people drive their cars might find that drivers need cup
               holders that can keep their beverages hot or cold when they spend long periods of time in the
               car. In addition, observing children traveling in their car seats may have revealed a need for a

               small  storage  area  for  their  food.  These  are  ideas  that  might  not  otherwise  have  been
               discovered  in  quantitative  survey  research.  However,  analyzing  the  data  from  qualitative
               research can reveal useful ideas such as these that can be recommended to companies.

                       While  researchers  are  analyzing  data,  they  may  note  some  differences  in  the
               consumer behavior process based on demographic or psychographic traits. For example, a
               qualitative research study might have been specifically designed to examine and compare the]]></page><page Index="714"><![CDATA[62


               differences in cell phone usage for different age groups. These types of differences will appear
               in  qualitative  data  from  focus  groups,  interviews  or  ethnographic  studies.  In  this  case

               researchers might perhaps find that women were using the photo feature to take pictures while
               shopping of possible purchases for their home that they can then view later. Meanwhile, it may
               also be found that males were using their cell phone cameras to take candid photos of their

               friends. These are ideas that can be developed into recommendations.
               Analyzing Quantitative Data

                       When  analyzing  the  data  from  quantitative  research,  consumers’  physical
               characteristics such as gender, age, religion, ethnicity, income, education level, or even their
               height,  hair  color  or  weight,  can  be  quantified.  In  addition,  consumers’  behavior  can  be

               quantified by frequency of purchase, consistency of purchase, place of purchase or size of
               purchase. Using statistical analysis, researchers will explain behavior using numbers rather

               than  words.  Furthermore,  if  the  sample  for  a  population  is  sufficiently  large  and  properly
               selected, researchers will be able to say with some certainty that the research findings are
               probably true for the total population (Hellebusch, 2006).

                       Scales of measurement
                       A computer will be used to tabulate the results of a survey, but the findings will still

               need  to  be  analyzed.  Before  the  methods  of  analysis  can  be  discussed  it  is  important  to
               understand measurement scales, as the type of scale used in designing the answer will affect
               the type of statistical analysis used.

                       People  use  measurement  scales  on  a  daily  basis.  When  consumers  decide  to
               purchase a rug for their bathroom floor, they may decide to use their own feet and pace out
               the floor space to be covered. When they go to the store, they can again measure off the

               space using their feet and find a rug that fits. Of course, it is simpler to use a measuring tape
               already marked off with standard units of measurement. In research it is also easier to use
               standard  measurement  scales.  The  four  standard  measurement  scales  researchers  have

               available  are  nominal,  ordinal,  interval  and  ratio.  There  is  a  very  good  reason  why  it  is
               important to understand the differences in measurement scales, as the choice of statistical

               procedure to analyze the data will depend on the scale being used.
                       The nominal scale. The nominal scale is used for characteristics that can be defined
               as different states of being. Male and female, for example, are two characteristics that are

               measured by the nominal scale. There are only the two states and a research participant must
               be one or the other. University graduate and non-university graduate are another example. A

               research participant can be one or the other, but not both. Nominal data are usually analyzed
               by simply counting the responses. A research study might find that of a study of 100 people
               on their favorite hobbies, 62 were male and 38 were female. The report might also state that]]></page><page Index="715"><![CDATA[63


               of  the  100  participants,  78  did  not  graduate  from  university  while  22  did  graduate.  When
               analyzing central tendency, the mode will be used.

                       Ordinal  measurement scale.  The  ordinal  scale  is  used  when  there  is not just  an
               absolute  difference,  such  as  male  or  female,  but  rather  a  degree  of  difference,  such  as
               preference. A question using the nominal scale would be ‘What type of pizza do you prefer?’

               This question, using an ordinal scale, would ask consumers to rank order their favorite types
               of pizza. Analyzing these data would provide a ranking such as participants’ favorite type of

               pizza  topping  is  pepperoni,  followed  by  cheese,  and  then  sausage.  While  this  measure
               provides information on ranking, what this type of measurement does not show is how much
               more popular pepperoni pizza is than cheese or sausage. When analyzing central tendency,

               the median will be used.
                       The interval scale. Using an interval scale will provide more information than just

               ranking. An interval scale adds a unit of measure with a start and finish, and the difference
               between  each  unit  of  measurement  being  the  same.  Researchers  construct  the  scale  by
               creating the starting and ending point of the scale and the units of measurement. In this type

               of ranking participants are given a choice of degrees. The question might ask if the pizza was
               very delicious, delicious, good, all right, or inedible. While the construction of the scale is
               arbitrary, it is assumed that the amount of difference between ‘delicious’ and ‘very delicious’

               is the same as the amount of difference between ‘good’ and ‘all right’. With this type of data
               researchers will be able to provide an average opinion of the pizza by all survey participants.
                       When constructing questions that will provide interval data, researchers can use a

               category rating scale, Likert scale or differential scale. A category rating scale gives a rating
               such as excellent, very good, good, poor, very poor, awful. In a Likert scale, five to seven

               choices are given that measure a participant’s opinion or agreement with a statement. This
               could be strongly agree, agree, undecided, disagree, strongly disagree. A number is attached
               to each category that allows researchers to provide an average. A semantic difference scale

               is also commonly used in interval measurement question construction. In this type of measure
               two opposing statements are made with seven points in between. A participant chooses where

               they stand on the subject by circling a number. An example of a semantic difference scale is
               an answer to the question ‘How would you rank our pizza?’ The possible responses would be
               given as: delicious 1-2-3-4-5-6-7 inedible. When analyzing central tendency, the mean will be

               used.
                       The ratio scale. A ratio scale has given start and end points that already exist and are
               not created by researchers. A consumer’s weight is an example of a ratio scale, as no person’s

               weight can be zero pounds. There is also an upper limit on what a human can weigh and still
               survive. On a ratio scale there is also the ability to measure exactly the difference between
               units. A person who weighs 200 pounds is exactly twice as heavy as a person who weighs]]></page><page Index="716"><![CDATA[64


               100 pounds. The use of the ratio scale in marketing is not as common as the use of the interval
               scale because marketing often asks questions about peoples’ preferences and opinions using

               an interval scale. When analyzing central tendency, the geometric mean will be used.

               Types of Statistical Analyses Used in Marketing Research

                       The problem confronting the marketing researcher when faced with a dataset is data
               analysis, which is defined as the process of describing a dataset by computing a small number
               of statistics that characterize various aspects of the data. Data analysis distills the dataset

               while  retaining  enough  information  so  the  client  can  mentally  envision  its  salient
               characteristics.
                       Five basic types of statistical analyses can be used by marketing researchers to reduce

               a dataset: descriptive analysis, inferential analysis, differences analysis, associative analysis,
               and predictive analysis. Each one has a unique role in the data analysis process; moreover,

               these various methods are usually combined into a complete analysis of the information to
               satisfy the research objectives. These techniques are progressively more complex, but at the
               same time, they convert raw data into increasingly more useful information as they increase

               in complexity.]]></page><page Index="717"><![CDATA[65

                       Descriptive analysis. Certain measures such as the mean, mode, standard deviation,
               and range are forms of descriptive analysis used by marketing researchers to describe the
               sample dataset in such a way as to portray the “typical” respondent and to reveal the general

               pattern of responses. Descriptive measures are typically used early in the analysis process
               and become foundations for subsequent analysis.

                       Inference  analysis.  When  marketing  researchers  use  statistical  procedures  to
               generalize  the  results  of  the  sample  to  the  target  population  it  represents,  the  process  is

               referred to as inference analysis. In other words, such statistical procedures allow a researcher
               to draw conclusions about the population based on information in the dataset provided by the
               sample. Inferential statistics include hypothesis testing and estimating true population values

               based on sample information.]]></page><page Index="718"><![CDATA[66


                       Hypothesis  testing  is  used  to  compare  the  sample  statistic  with  what  is  believed
               (hypothesized) to be the population value prior to undertaking the study. The standard error is

               a measure of the variability in the sampling distribution based on what is theoretically believed
               to occur were we to take a multitude of independent samples from the same population.
                       Difference  analysis.  Occasionally,  a  marketing  researcher  needs  to  determine

               whether two groups are different. For example, the researcher may be investigating credit card
               usage and want to see if high-income earners differ from moderate-income earners in how

               often they use credit cards. The researcher may statistically compare the average annual peso
               expenditures charged on credit cards by high- versus moderate- income buyers. Important
               market segmentation information may come from this analysis. Or the researcher may run an

               experiment to see which of several alternative advertising themes garners the most favorable
               impression  from  a  sample  of  target  audience  members.  The  researcher  uses  difference

               analysis  to  determine  the  degree  to  which  real  and  generalizable  differences  exist  in  the
               population to help the manager make an enlightened decision on which advertising theme to
               use.  Statistical  differences  analyses  include  the  t  test  for  significant  differences  between

               groups and analysis of variance.
                       Association  analysis.  Researchers  use  other  statistical  techniques  to  determine
               systematic relationships among variables. Association analysis investigates if and how two

               variables are related. For instance, are advertising recall scores positively associated with
               intentions to buy the advertised brand? Are expenditures on sales force training positively
               associated with sales force performance? Depending on the statistic used, the analysis may

               indicate the strength of the association and/or the direction of the association between two
               questions on a questionnaire in a given study.

                       Predictive analysis. Techniques are also available if the researcher is interested in
               determining more complex patterns of associations. Statistical procedures and models are
               available to the marketing researcher to help make forecasts about future events, and these

               fall  under  the  category  of  predictive  analysis.  The  marketing  researcher  commonly  uses
               regression  analysis  to  enhance  prediction  capabilities.  Because  marketing  managers  are

               typically worried about what will happen in the future given certain conditions such as a price
               increase,  prediction  is  desirable.  Predictive  analysis  can  provide  valuable  insight  into  the
               nature of multiple relationships among the variables in a dataset.]]></page><page Index="719"><![CDATA[67


                                            Writing Report and Presentation

                       Marketing researchers should not conduct research purely for the purpose of knowing.

               Research study was conducted to find a solution to the dilemma. While the data has been
               gathered and analyzed, the analysis of the marketing researchers has not yet been completed.
               Over  all,  the  study  done  by  the  marketing  researchers  does  not  solve  the  management

               dilemma. Instead, it is the raw material that provides information that researchers can use to
               make  recommendations  to  solve  the  problem  (Schlaikjer,  2007).  If  the  researchers  have
               finished the study and established the recommendations, the next move is to convey this

               knowledge in a written and oral manner that is both accessible and feasible.


               Reasons for Preparing a Report

                   1.  Explanation of research terminology and methodology
                       Researchers must write a detailed study, since management may not be willing to

                   understand  the  research  methodology  or  the  theoretical  framework  without  a  good
                   description. Terms such as stratified sample’, ‘projective techniques’ or ‘confidence level’
                   might have no significance to anyone whose duty is to make research-based judgments.

                   Without  an  explanation  of  these  terms,  the  data  would  be  either  irrelevant  or
                   misunderstood. Marketing research is often used in fields other than consumer marketing.

                   For example, a study done on political issues may well have a reader acquainted with
                   political strategy but unfamiliar with research methodology (Wring, 2006).
                   2.  Preservation of knowledge for future employees

                       The  second  reason  for  a  written  report  is  that  the  information  obtained  from  the
                   research remains to be accessible in the future. Research findings and recommendations
                   are to be developed by both the marketing and management teams. All businesses have

                   workforce adjustments and it is especially important for marketing personnel to shift roles
                   regularly. Even the manager who commissioned the research may be promoted or leave
                   the company.  If there is no written paper, the new manager would not have access to the

                   information arising from the research study. Under this scenario, duplicate study can be
                   conducted.

                   3.  Documentation of actionable ideas based on research
                       An important purpose of the report is not only to report data or information. The written
                   report is where the recommendations that result from the data and analysis are explained.

                   These  recommendations  are  the  result  of  marketing  researchers’  analysis  and
                   interpretation of the data. These recommendations should be reported as actionable ideas

                   that management should consider implementing.]]></page><page Index="720"><![CDATA[68


                   4.  Clarification in case of misunderstanding

                          A final reason for writing the report is to ensure that the marketing researchers who
                   have conducted the research have a document that details findings and conclusions in
                   case of future misunderstanding. If management makes a decision that causes a future

                   loss  of  revenue,  it  might  be  easy  to  state  that  the  decision  was  based  on  research
                   conducted  by  the  marketing  department.  If  there  is  a  written  document  this

                   misrepresentation can be clarified.

               Writing a Professional Report

                   If the research report is going to be read, instead of just sitting on someone’s desk, it is
               important that it be readable, interesting, and concise. A report that contains too much jargon,

               is poorly organized and is visually unattractive will not be read. This is especially the case
               because  most  people  have  multiple  tasks  to  accomplish  each  day  and  will  complete  the
               easiest task first.

                   Readable. Problems that researchers should consider prior to writing a study may involve
               a writing style. It is just as crucial that the report is presented in the appropriate manner as it
               contains the right information. Before starting to compose a paper, researchers can determine

               about  which  the  research  is  being  written.  When  a  report  is  written  for  someone  in  the
               marketing department, a more professional format would be used. Here it may be expected
               that the reader would be comfortable with the terminology of research. However, if the report

               is written by someone who operates a small business researcher, they may write in a more
               colloquial style while being sure to describe each term.

                   Interesting. Any report should be exciting to read as well. Researchers can not only state
               the truth, but also include descriptions of interesting events that have happened during the
               research process. This sort of information would help to bring the data to life in the reader's

               mind. Another option to bring relevance to the study is to include the images of the people
               participating in the research process. If this is not possible, specific quotations should be used
               to give readers the idea that they were at the research sessions.

                   Concise.  The  report  should  be  kept  as  simple  as  possible  but  also  providing  all  the
               necessary information. It can also be arranged so that readers can access the amount of
               information they want without actually reading the whole report. This can be done by including

               a well-written summary overview and specifically naming of each part. In addition, headings
               and subheadings should be used throughout the report so that a specific issue can be found

               quickly.]]></page><page Index="721"><![CDATA[69


               Using Visual Material

                   The research findings section will contain a wealth of detailed numerical data. A report
               writer  should  use  visuals  to  help  communicate this  information  whenever  possible.  These
               visuals will assist readers in understanding the relationship between different sets of data. To

               assist readers, such detailed data can be presented in the form of tables, charts and graphs.
                   Tables. A table simply lists numbers in rows by categories. Individual numbers will still be

               discussed in the body of the text. However, if the report writer uses a table, they will not need
               to mention all the numbers. For a guide, see example below.































                                        Figure 7.1 Sample of a table in final research paper

                       Pie charts. A pie chart is a visual method to present raw numbers and their relationship
               as percentages of a whole. A pie chart is simply a circle that is divided into areas that are

               represented by size. Pie charts are useful when representing numbers that make up a whole,
               such as the percentage of customers in different age groups. The different sections of a pie
               chart should be shown in various colors or in shades of gray for each group. Using color to

               differentiate the sections makes a pie chart easier to read and use. Pie charts are static, in
               that they do not show changes over time. However, constructing more than one pie chart can
               be used to show how data have changed.]]></page><page Index="722"><![CDATA[70

                   Bar charts. Bar charts represent the values of different items so that these can be easily
               compared. The difference from pie charts is that bar charts do not necessarily show items that

               are part of a known whole. However, a bar chart will be used to show the relative size of the
               raw numbers of people in each age group who are product users. A bar chart can be shown
               with the bars vertical or horizontal. Bar charts can also be used to show changes over time by

               combining two sets of numbers collected at different dates. Each set of data can be shown
               next to each other on the chart.

                   Line charts. A line chart is designed to show changes in data over periods of time. Time
               is shown on the horizontal axis, while the numerical measurement is shown on the vertical

               axis. A line chart can show the percentage change in a product’s sales by any measurement
               of time, such as by the day, month, season or year. The advantage of a line chart is that it can
               easily display movement in a value over time for more than one variable.]]></page><page Index="723"><![CDATA[71

               Oral Presentation

                       An  oral presentation  is an  opportunity  for  researchers to  clarify  and 'market' some
               findings  and  recommendations  from  the  research.  The  oral  analysis  often  encourages

               researchers  to  provide  a  more  accurate  description  of  the  research  methodology.  This  is
               because, during an oral presentation, the presenter, by observing their audience, may become
               mindful of where they encounter difficulties and can clarify some conflicting information more

               thoroughly. In addition, the presenter should clarify more precisely how the recommendations
               of the study apply to the findings of the research. Finally, an oral presentation provides a
               means to clarify any misunderstandings about the research process.


               Reasons for Oral Presentation

                  •   Α clearer explanation of methodology
                  •   An opportunity to explain the tie between research findings and recommendations
                  •   An opportunity to clarify misunderstandings

                   Everyone knows that a good presentation requires preparation. However, not everyone
               knows that there are other issues that must be considered if a presentation is to proceed
               flawlessly. These include:

                   Know the audience – including who they are, what they already know about the subject,
               what they want to learn from the presentation, and what management wants them to learn

               from the presentation.
                   Know the surroundings – including the comfort of the room, where the audience will sit,
               where the presenter will stand, whether the layout will allow the presenter to circulate around

               the room and the availability of flip charts, white boards and computer equipment
                   Know  the  presentation  –  including  the  length  of  time  required  by  practicing  the
               presentation while using the required equipment, either alone or in front of others.

                       In addition, a presentation should be performed in the same room if possible in front of
               a  similar  audience  that  will  be  used  later.  A  rehearsal  presentation  would  mean  that  the]]></page><page Index="724"><![CDATA[72


               presenter will be happier before the final presentation is made, and will be able to reflect on
               the crowd instead of the presentation.

               What to Avoid during Oral Presentation?
                   1.  Reading out the report
                   2.  Presenting PowerPoint slides that are unreadable

                   3.  Boring the audience
                   4.  Not interacting with the audience

                   5.  Using too much supporting material
                   6.  Not being emotionally involved with the presentation’s contents





                                               Communicating Findings

                       Research is not complete until it is written up and discussed results, not only with other
               researchers who can develop on it and further progress the study, but also with others who

               can benefit from it, who can use it, and who have an interested in it. Etymologically, the Latin
               "communio" is for engagement and collaboration. Communication and collaboration are two
               terms that express the same idea.

               Why Communicate Research Results?
                   1.  Essential for utilization

                   2.  Allows for other researchers to critique
                   3.  Stimulates others to replicate or develop similar studies
                   4.  Provides rewards for the researcher

                         •    Recognition
                         •    Advancement

                         •    Psychological boost
                         •    Financial compensation
                   5.  No research project is complete until the final report has been written

                   6.  Theses and dissertations
                   7.  Research results presented at professional

                   8.  Publishing a journal article
                   9.  Improve the dissemination and repackaging of research for continuing knowledge.
                   10. Strengthen the networking between researchers, policymakers and practitioners as

                       standard evidence-based practice.]]></page><page Index="725"><![CDATA[73


               Common Problems in Preparing the Marketing Research Report

                   •   Lack of data interpretation
                   •   Unnecessary use of complex statistics
                   •   Emphasis on packaging instead of quality

                   •   Lack of relevance
                   •   Placing too much emphasis on a few statistics

               Guidelines for Preparing Oral Presentations
                   •   Visual component should not detract from the information being communicated

                   •   Be friendly, honest, warm, and open your oral communication
                   •   Delivery should be knowledgeable and confident

                   •   Have a well-organized and inspiring dialogue prepared
                   •   Be an effective active listener

               products and services

               -Is the art or skill in selling

               What is the difference between selling and salesmanship?

               Salesmanship is the art of convincing and persuading people to buy the product, while
               selling  is  just  transferring  the  title  in  goods,  services  or  ideas  with  a  valuable
               consideration.

               Importance of Salesmanship

               2.  The  customer  usually  goes  to  the  seller  instead  of  the  seller  seeking  out  for
               customers.

               further grouped into three major types:

               1. The Pioneer-Products Sales People
               -These  are  individuals  whose  function  is  to  secure  outlets  for  a  new  product  to
               wholesalers, distributors, and dealers.

               their chief duty is to promote sales.
               - They are sometimes called “sales promoter” because they gather latest information

               about their target market, give advice and counseling to middlemen and try to favorably
               influence sales volume.
               - Traditionally,  these  individuals  are  called  “merchandisers”,  “detailers”  and

                     Selling the product/service
                     Trial close
                     Overcoming objections
                     Close
                     Asking for referrals

               Before you make your calls, you should have available information as listed above i.e.
               past contact with the customer.
                     You should  also think  about  exactly  what  you  are  going to say. Write  it  down.
                       Particularly the initial  introduction,  which  will  not  vary  much from call to call.  If
                       necessary, practice your introduction with a colleague until it sounds right.

               Prepare for the most likely responses to your approach, and be aware that 80% of what
               happens will happen time after time.

                     It's only occasionally that something will happen to surprise you, when you'll just
                       have to think on your feet. The best response in those circumstances is to say 'I'll
                       have to check this out. I will let you know by this afternoon/tomorrow/next week'
                     Depending  on  whether  or  not  you  have  talked  to  the  customer  before,  your
                       approach should name your contact, introduce yourself by name, your company
                       and  the  nature  of  its  business,  and  the  purpose  of  your  call.  This  introduction
                       should  be  no  longer  than  45  seconds,  and  should  always  end  with  an  open-
                       ended question that invites extended comment.
                     'Good morning Mr. Steed, my name is Emma Peel, from The Excellent Products
                       Co.  We  specialize  in  providing  customers  in  the  scientific  research  field  with
                       laboratory  supplies  including  the  world  famous  Expanding Widget  System.  I'm
                       calling  you  today  to  find  out  exactly  what  your  requirements  are  and  how  we
                       might  be  able  to  help  you.  Now  I  know  that  you  are  involved  in  the  field  of
                       quantum physics, but tell me  Mr. Steed,  exactly  what sort  of research  are  you
                       currently engaged upon?'
                     It  is  useless  to  attempt  to  sell  someone  something  until  you  know  whether  it
                       would be  of  any  use to  them. Therefore,  all successful sales begin with  an in-
                       depth  questioning  procedure  that  helps  the  salesperson  assess  what  the
                       customer  wants/needs,  and  enables  them  to  decide  whether  or  not  the
                       product/service you are promoting is likely to be of interest, and if so, how best to
                       promote it.
                     From the initial question asked at the end of the introduction, you should ask a
                       series  of  questions  to  establish  this  knowledge.  If  possible  you  should  have
                       prepared  these  questions  before.  They  should  be  asked  in  a  spirit  of  genuine
                       interest and inquisitiveness, rather than in a mechanical form-filling-in style.
                     Customers  warm  to  people  who  seem  genuinely  interested  in  them,  and  are
                       likely  to  open  up  more.  You  should  take  the  attitude  that  it  doesn't  matter  too
                       much if you don't sell something on this particular occasion, but to have gained
                       information about the customer and to have started or improved your relationship
                       with them in a friendly positive manner is still a good 'result'.
                     Questions you ask should as far as possible be open ended questions, beginning
                       with  the  words  Who,  What,  When,  Where,  How  and  Why.  It  is  impossible  to
                       answer these questions with a blunt Yes or No, and the speaker has to give you
                       some extended information. As you ask your questions, you might bear in mind
                       that  if  you  get  stumped  or  caught  on  the  hop,  you  can  always  prolong  the
                       conversation by asking 'What else can you tell me?'
                     When you feel you understand the customer's position, and hopefully ascertained
                       their wants/needs, you should confirm that you have understood what they have
                       told  you. By  doing this  you  are  ensuring that  you do indeed  have  all  the facts
                       right,  and  also  reassuring  the  customer  that  they  are  talking  to  a  professional
                       businessperson who has their best interests at heart.
                     The benefits that are of greatest value to customers are saving time and money,
                       which amounts to the same thing really. Other highly regarded benefits are that


                                                             13]]></page><page Index="740"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY            Department of Management

                       life  is  made  easier,  that  prestige/kudos  can  be  gained,  and  that  personal
                       advancement might be brought about. If you can show that your product/service
                       will bring about some or all of these things, your customer is quite likely to want
                       to buy!

               When you feel you have aroused your customer's interest in your product/service, you
               should test the strength of their willingness to buy.
                     'So  if  we  can  demonstrate  that  our  machine  really  can  test  widgets  under
                       extremes  of temperature  and  pressure  as  you described  earlier, then  you'd be
                       interested in buying such a machine would you, Mr. Steed?'
                     It  may  be  that  no  further  discussion  is  needed  and  the  customer  immediately
                       places a large order with you. Alternatively, they might have a few questions.
                     At this point you may well be faced with any number of objections. The customer
                       will want to know how much your products/services cost, and they may well have
                       problems with that, either in principle or for some tangible reason (they haven't
                       got  enough  money). They  may  well be locked into  exclusive supplier  contracts
                       with someone else. They may feel that your product/service isn't quite what they
                       want after all.
                     You have to address each of these objections, firstly by questioning until you
                       understand exactly what the customer means. It helps to empathies with their
                       point of view, to demonstrate that you are 'on their side', anxious to find a
                       solution to the dilemma.
                       Then you must attempt to explain carefully your own perspective, and how the
                       customer might look at your 'solution' more positively.
                     Finally you must apply your trial close again, to find out if you have persuaded
                       the customer satisfactorily. If not, you could try again
                     It's commonly said that a good salesperson should try four times to overcome an
                       objection. After that, you're probably wasting your time. Just remember that you'll
                       never win every sale, but you can use every conversation to gather information,
                       and  build  a  rapport  with  your  customers.  If  you  feel  you  have  overcome  the
                       objections  it  is  still  wise  to  find  out  if  the  customer  has  any  other  concerns
                       ('obtaining the whole shopping list'). Only if you are sure that they have no other
                       worries can you proceed to the close.
                     If you have successfully overcome any objections that have been put up, and the
                       customer appears to want to buy from you, then you must 'close the sale'.
                     Again, this is a subject about which entire books have been written, but you can
                       simply  ask  the  customer  when  they  would  like  the  Expanded  Widget  System
                       delivered, whether they would like one or two, or whether they would like ten, in
                       which case they would qualify for some discount.
                     Basically  you  are  required  to  gain  the  customer's  commitment  to  accept  your
                       product or service on the terms you have stipulated, or otherwise agreed with the
                       customer.

                     If at this point the customer throws up more objections, you must retreat a stage,
                       and deal with the matter accordingly.
                     Once  the  sale  has  been  agreed,  tie  up  all  the  necessary  details  regarding
                       delivery, price, and payment, in accordance with your company's procedures.
                     After  you  have  successfully  closed  the  sale,  you  should  maximize  your  good
                       fortune  by  asking  'What  else  can  we  help  you  with?',  and  probing  for  future
                       opportunities.
                     You should also ask who else the customer knows that could benefit from your
                       service. If necessary prompt a bit and suggest - other departments, colleagues,
                       suppliers, customers?
                     Use the opportunity also to promote other areas of your own business - 'Did you
                       know we also supply training? Would this be of interest to you?'
                   Finally…

                         Make careful notes of all conversations and agreements.
                         Send letters confirming everything. Keep copies.

                   Make another call!

                     How do they buy?
                     When do they buy?

                   Types of Customers

                   1. PRODUCERS – buy products and services to manufacture and sell their products
                   and services to customers.
                       Buyers working for producers are involved in two types of buying situations:
                       a.  buying  products  that  will  be  included  in  the  products  the  company  is
                   manufacturing; or
                       b. buying products and services to support the manufacturing operations.

                   OEM PURCHASER (Original Equipment Manufacturers) – they purchase goods to
                   use in making their products.
                            Salespeople selling OEM products need to demonstrate that their
                              products help their customers produce products that will offer superior
                              value.











                            Most  of    OEM  products  are  bought  in  large  quantities  on  an  annual
                              contract,  the  purchasing  department    negotiates  the  contract  w/  the
                              supplier; however, engineering and production departments play a major
                              role in the purchase decisions

               Why does engineering and production department play a major role in purchase
               decision?
                     Engineers  evaluate  the  products  and  may  prepare  specifications  for  a
                       custom design; and
                     The production department works with the supplier to make sure that the OEM
                       products are delivered “JUST IN TIME”

               2. END-USER PURCHASES

               When did we say that a producer is an end- user?
                     When they buy goods and services to support their own production and
                       operations, they are acting as end users.
               What are the inclusions of an “end user” buying situation?
                     Capital equipment – major purchases such as mainframe computers and
                       machine tools that the producer uses for no. of years
                     Maintenance, repair and operating supplies – includes paper towels and
                       replacement parts for machinery
                     Services – internet and telephone connections, employment agencies,
                       consultants, and transportations.
               3. RESELLERS – buy finished goods or services with the intention to resell them to
               businesses and consumers.
                     because they do not use the products, and they are interested primarily in the
                       attractiveness of the products to their customers.

               4. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES - government buyers typically develop detailed
               specifications for a product and then invite qualified suppliers to submit bids.
                     However, government agencies are beginning to use less bureaucratic
                       procedures when they purchase commercial products.

               5. INSTITUTIONS – another important customer group consists of public and private
               institutions such as churches, hospitals and colleges.
                     Often these institutions have purchasing rules and procedures that are as
                       complex and rigid as those used by government agencies.

               6. CONSUMERS – purchase products and services for use by themselves or by their
               families.
                     A lot of salespeople sell insurance, automobiles, clothing, and real estate to
                       consumers.
                     However, college graduates often take sales job that involve selling to business
                       enterprises government agencies or institutions
               Smith’s tips for CYCLE selling are:

               STAY BUSY













               DERIVED VERSUS DIRECT DEMAND
                     Derived demand means that purchases made by the customers ultimately
                       depend on the demand for their products – either organizations or consumers.
                     Direct demand is a demand for a product or service for its own sake, and not for
                       what can be derived from it. Independent for the demand of other product.

               STEPS IN THE BUYING PROCESS
                     Recognize a Need or a problem

                     EMOTIONAL NEEDS

               ETHICS AND PERSONAL SELLING

               Ethics
                     are the principles governing the behavior of an individual or group.
                     this  principles establish appropriate behavior indicating what is right and wrong.
                     defining the term is easy, but determining what the principles are is difficult.
                     what one person thinks is right another may consider wrong.

               Some examples of difficult situations that salespeople face:
                     Should you give an expensive gift to a buyer?
                     Is it acceptable to use a high pressure sales approach when you know your
                       product is the best for the consumer’s needs?
                     Should you attempt to sell a product to a customer if you know a better product
                       exists for that application?
                     If you know about the poor performance features of a competing product, should
                       you tell the customer about them?
                     Should you put the cost of a hotel room on your expense account even though
                       you stayed at a friend’s house during business trip?

                     Personal, Company and Customer Needs – creates conflict toward each other
                     Values Significant to others – people acquire their values and attitudes about
                       what is right and wrong from the people they interact with and observe.
                     Company Policies - to maintain good relationships with their companies and
                       customers, salespeople need to have a clear sense of right and wrong so that
                       their companies and customers can depend on them when questionable
                       situations arise.
                            Many companies have codes of ethics for their salespeople to provide
                              guidelines in making ethical decisions.

               SELLING ETHICS AND RELATIONSHIPS
                     Relationship with  customers
                       1. Deception – deliberately presenting inaccurate information, or lying, to a
                       customer is illegal.
                       2. Bribes, Gifts and Entertainment
                       Bribes are payments made  to buyers to influence their purchase decisions
                       confidential information will not trust the salesperson, who will then be denied
                       access information needed to make an effective sales presentation.
                       3. Kickbacks – are payments made to buyers based on the amount of orders
                       placed.
                       4. Bribes and kickbacks may be illegal – determining gifts and entertainment
                       activities are acceptable and which are not brings up ethical issues.
                       5. Special Treatments – Some customers try to take advantage of their status to
                       get special treatment from salespeople.
                       6. Confidential Information – offering information about a customer’s
                       competitor in exchange for an order is unethical.
                       7. Backdoor selling – salespeople engage in backdoor selling when they ignore
                       the purchasing agent’s policy, go around his or her back, and contact other
                       people directly involved in purchasing decisions.

                     Relationship with the Salesperson’s Company
                       1. Expense Account – many companies provide their salespeople with cars and
                       reimburse them for travel and entertainments expenses. In using the company’s
                       expense account, you should act as though you are spending your own money.
                       2. Reporting Work – Time Information and Activity – to monitor work activities,
                       Many companies ask their salespeople to provide daily call reports.
                       3. Switching Jobs - the ethical approach to leave a job includes the ff:
                            Give ample notice. If you leave a job during a busy time and with
                              inadequate notice, your employer may suffer significant loss sales
                              opportunities.
                            Offer assistance during the transition phase. Help your replacement learn
                              about your customers and territory.

                            Don’t burn your bridges. Don’t say things in anger that may come back to
                              haunt you. Remember that you want to return to the company or ask the
                              company for a reference in the future.\

                     Relationship with colleagues
                       1.  Sexual  Harassment  –  includes  unwelcome  sexual  advances,  requests  for
                       sexual favors, jokes, graffiti and physical conduct.
                       2. Customers as well as co-workers can sexually harass salespeople. The ff
                       are some suggestions for dealing with sexual harassment from customers:
                            Don’t  become  so  dependent  on  one  customer  that  you  would  consider
                              compromising your principles to retain the customer’s business. Develop a
                              large base of customers and prospects to minimize the importance of one
                              customer.
                       3. Tell the harasser in person or write a letter stating that the behavior is
                       offensive, is unacceptable, and must be stopped. Clearly indicate that you are in
                       control and will not be passive.
                       4. Utilize the sexual harassment policies of your firm and your customer’s firm to
                       resolve problems.  These policies typically state the procedure for filing a
                       complaint, the person responsible for investigating the complaint, the time frame
                       for completing the investigation, and the means by which the parties will be
                       informed about the resolution.
                       5. Taking Advantage of other Salespeople – salespeople can behave
                       unethically when they are too aggressive in pursuing their own goals at the
                       expense of their colleagues.

                     Relationship with competitors
                       1. Making false claims about competitors’ product or sabotaging their  efforts is
                       clearly unethical and often illegal. Another one is criticizing a competitor’s
                       products or policies. Although you may be tempted to say negative things about
                       a competitor, this approach usually does not work.

                                   Products, And Technologies



               Instructional Objectives:


               After the completion of the lesson, students will be able to:

               1.  determine the sources of sales knowledge.
               2.  explain how knowledge builds relationships

               5.  determine the importance of knowing your competition, industry, and economy

               Legal Guidelines

               To reduce the chances of violating laws governing sales practices, you should adopt the
               ff. guidelines:
                     Be sure that all specific statements about your product’s performance are
                       accurate.
                     Be sure that all specific positive statements about performance can be supported
                       by evidence.
                     If your customers do not pay attention to warnings and operating instructions,
                       remind them to read this information
                     If customers contemplate using your product incorrectly or in an inappropriate
                       application, caution them especially about how the product should be used.
                     Assess your customer’s experience and knowledge.
                     Don’t make negative statements about a competitors product, financial condition
                       or business practices.
                     Many countries make a clear distinction between payments for lubrication and
                       payments for subordination.
                     Lubrication involves small sums of money or gifts, typically made to low-ranking
                       managers or government officials, in countries where these payments are not
                       illegal. The lubrication payments are made to get the official or manager to do the
                       job more rapidly – to process an order more quickly to provide a copy of a
                       request for a proposal.
                     Subordination involves paying larger sums of money to higher-ranking officials to
                       get them to do something that is illegal or to ignore an illegal act.

               What is cultural relativism?

                     is the principle that an individual human's beliefs and activities should be
                       understood by others in terms of that individual's own culture.

                                                             26]]></page><page Index="753"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY            Department of Management

                     is the view that all beliefs, customs, and ethics are relative to the individual within
                       his own social context. In other words, “right” and “wrong” are culture-specific;
                       what is considered moral in one society may be considered immoral in another,
                       and, since no universal standard of morality exists, no one has the right to judge
                       another society’s customs.
               American vs. Indian Culture
               1.Indians are very much family oriented, the Americans are individual oriented.
               2.Indians respect family values. On the other hand, in American culture ,the individual
               values gets prominence than the family values.
               3.Indians are more competitive than the Americans.
               4.Americans have great regard to time and its value. On the other hand, Indians are a
               lazy lot.
                     Sales puffery is exaggerating the features of a particular item such as "this car
                       make you look young, chic, rich, and 25 pounds lighter." It's not exactly a lie but a
                       slight distortion of the truth.
                     Misrepresentation is a deliberative falsehood such as, "This car is brand new"
                       when in fact it was a used car.

                       another product.
                     Conspiracy – an agreement between competitors before customers are
                       contracted
                     Collusion – competitors working together while the customer is making a
                       purchase decision.
               Interference with Competitors

                     Tampering with competitor’s product
                     Confusing a competitor’s market research by buying merchandise from stores.

               Using Communication Principles to Build Relationship

               Building relationship through Two-way Communication

               The Communication Process
                   •  Begins with the sender, who wants to communicate some thoughts or ideas.
                   •  The translation of thoughts into words is called encoding.
                   •  Decoding involves the interpretation of the meaning of the received message.
                   •  The feedback implies to the sender whether the message is received or not by
                       the receiver.

               Communication Breakdown
                   •  Can be used by encoding and decoding problems and the environment in which
                       the communication occur.
                   •  Noises are sounds unrelated to messages being exchanged by the salesperson
                       and the customers.
                   •  People communicate effectively when they are physically comfortable.

               Communication Methods
               1. Interactivity
                     a function of the time between sending a message and getting a response to it.
               2. Verbal Communication
                     involves the transmission of words in face-to-face communication, over the
                       telephone or through written messages.
               3. Non Verbal Communication
                     forms of expression – body language, space and appearance – the communicate
                       thoughts and emotions without using words.
               4. Sending Verbal Messages
                     Messages communicated verbally are encoded into symbols called words.
                     Words are just symbols; they have different meaning to people.

               Effective Use of Words
                   •  Words can be abstract or concrete as well as emotional or neutral
                   •  Concrete – fact-oriented and expressions usually convey more information and
                       are less likely to be misinterpreted. Abstract – conceptual words.

               Using Effective Words

                   •  Word artists have the power of soft and appealing or strong and powerful; they
                       can use short words and phrases to demonstrate the strength and force or to
                       provide charm and grace.
                   •  With practice, words may be used, like notes of musical instruments, to create
                       the proper mood.
                   •  Words in sales presentation should have strength and descriptive quality.

               Painting Word Pictures
                   •  Word Pictures – a story designed to help visualize a point; help customers
                       understand the benefits of a product or service.
                   •  To use a word picture effectively, the salesperson needs to paint as accurate and
                       reliable picture as possible.
                   •  It should be honest attempts to help the buyer visualize the situation.

               4. Tailoring Words to Customer
                   •  Customers can have different styles of communicating. Some people may be
                       very visual; others prefer an auditory communication mode; and still others
                       communicate in feeling mode.
                   •  Salespeople need to adapt their word choices to the customers preferred
                       communication style.


               Voice Characteristics

               Speech Rate

                   •  Customers have a tendency to question expertise of salespeople who talk slower
                       or faster than the normal rate of 140 words per minute.
                   •  Salespeople should also vary their rate of speech
                   •  Simple  messages can  be delivered  at faster rates,  and  more  difficult concepts
                       should be presented at slower rates.
               Loudness

                   •  To  avoid  monotony,  salespeople  should  learn  to  vary  the  loudness  of  their
                       speech.

                   •  It can also be used to emphasize certain parts of the sales presentation
                   •  Salespeople should use customer reactions to determine the appropriate
                       loudness.

               Inflection


                   •  It is the tone of speech
                   •  At the end of the sentence, the tone should decrease, indicating the completion
                       of a thought
                   •  When the tones goes up at the end of a sentence, listeners often  sense
                       uncertainty of the speaker.

               Articulation

                   •  It refers to the production of recognizable sounds
                   •  Poor articulation has three common causes: (1) locked jaw (2) lazy lips (3)lazy
                       tongue
                   •  Best when a speaker opens his mouths properly and the movement of the lips
                       and tongue
                   •  Best when a speaker opens his mouth properly and the movement of the lips and
                       tongue are unimpeded.

               Encourage Full Response

                   •  Close- ended questions can be answered with a word or short phrase;  draw little
                       information form the customer
                   •  Open  –ended questions  are questions  for  which  there  are  no simple  answers
                       and encourage greater communication
               Space out Your Question


                   •  Questions  should  be  spaced  out  so  the  customer  has  time  to  answer  each
                       question in a relaxed atmosphere.
                   •  One method for spacing out question is to encourage prospect to elaborate on
                       their responses.

               Avoid Leading Question

                   •  Questions should not suggest an appropriate answer
                   •  Such question may put into words into customer mouth rather than drawing out
                       what the customer actually thinks.

               Active Listening


                   •  Effective listeners think while they listen
                   •  The listener attempts to draw out as much information as possible
                   •  Gestures can motivate a person to continue talking.

                   ▪  Economic and Technological Changes
                          –  Shift in jobs for manufacturing and agriculture to service industries and
                              telecommunications.
                          –  Pressures of global competition causing firms to adapt by lowering costs

               HR Management Challenges
                   ▪  Workforce Availability and Quality
                          –  Inadequate supply of workers with needed skills for “knowledge jobs”
                          –  Education of workers in basic skills
                   ▪  Growth in Contingent Workforce

                              employees, and part-timers caused by:
                                 •  Need for flexibility in staffing levels
                                 •  Increased difficulty in firing regular employees.

                   ▪  Organizational Restructuring, Mergers, and Acquisitions
                          –  “Right-sizing”—eliminating of layers of management, closing facilities,
                              merging with other organizations, and outplacing workers
                                 •  Intended results are flatter organizations, increases in productivity,
                                     quality, service and lower costs.
                                 •  Costs are survivor mentality, loss of employee loyalty, and turnover
                                     of valuable employees.
                          –  HR managers must work toward ensuring cultural compatibility in mergers.

                                              Internal Recruiting Methods









               Recruitment needs
                   ▪  Are of three types
                          –  Planned – arising from changes in organizational g structure, policy of
                              retirement etc
                          –  Anticipated – movement in personnel which an organization can predict
                              by studying trends in internal and external environment
                          –  Unexpected – resignation, death, accident, illness

               Purpose and Importance of effective recruitment
                   ▪  The increasing unemployment means that the labour market is large, hence the
                       need to ensure that you attract the right candidates for the jobs
                   ▪  High turnover for some occupations are another problem for recruiting
                   ▪  Finding the right inducements for attracting and hiring  employees can be a
                       problem also
                   ▪  Attract and encourage more and more candidates to apply in the organization
                   ▪  Create a talent pool of candidates to enable the selection of the best candidates
                       for  the organization
                   ▪  Determine present and future requirements of the organization in conjunction
                       with its personnel planning and job analysis activities as
               Recruitment process
                   ▪  Identifying the vacancy : - post to be filled, number of persons, duties to be
                       performed, qualifications required
                   ▪  Preparing the JD and JS
                   ▪  Locating and developing the sources of required number and type of employees
                   ▪  Short listing

               Factors affecting recruitment
                   ▪  Internal factors
                          –  Recruitment policy
                          –  HR planning
                          –  Size of the firm
                          –  Cost of recruitment
                          –  Growth and expansion

                   ▪  External factors
                          –  Supply and demand
                          –  Labour market


                                                             64]]></page><page Index="825"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY   Department of Management
                                            Tanza Campus                  BMGT 23: Human Resource Management

                          –  Image/goodwill
                          –  Political-social-legal environment
                          –  Unemployment rates
                          –  Competitors

               Sources of recruitment: internal and external
                   ▪  Internal: seeks to fill  positions from among the rank of those currently employed
                   ▪  Best suitable in succession planning – the process of ensuring a suitable supply
                       of successors for current and future senior  or key jobs
               Advantages:
                       1. It is less costly than external recruiting
                       2. Organizations have a better knowledge of internal applicants skills and abilities
                       than that which can be acquired of  candidates in an external recruiting effort
                       3. Through performance appraisal and other sources of information about current
                       personnel, decision makers typically will have much more extensive knowledge
                       on internal candidates and thus make more valid selection decisions
                       4. An organization policy of promotion from within can enhance organizational
                       commitment and job satisfaction, leading to lower employee turnover and
                       productivity
                       5. Best used for succession planning

               Disadvantages:
                       1. If the organization has decided to change its business strategy, entrenched
                       managers are problem not the best “change masters”” since the internal
                       recruitment approach simply propagate the old way of doing things
                       2. Complaints of unit poaching good employees from another unit
                       3. Politics have a greater impact on internal recruitment. Personal biased
                       decisions towards specific candidates not necessarily based on performance or
                       job requirements
                       4. Employees who apply for jobs and do not get them may become
                       discontented,: telling unsuccessful applicants why they were rejected and what
                       remedial action might take to be more successful in future is thus crucial
                       5. Although many times managers post job opening and interviews to all
                       candidates, the manager often knows ahead of time exactly whom he or she
                       wants to hire . Requiring the person to interview a stream of unsuspecting
                       candidates can be a waste of time for all concerned

               Sources of internal recruitment
               Job posting/advertising
                   ▪  The most efficient way to do it is to have a job-posting system where
                       announcement for positions is made available to all employees through
                       newsletters, bulletin boards and so on.
                   ▪  When properly done, job posting can substantially improve quality of job
                       placement that are made within the organizations


                                                             65]]></page><page Index="826"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY   Department of Management

               Personnel records
                   ▪  Another way is to examine personnel records which may reveal employees who
                       are working in job below their education or skill levels,  or/and have potential for
                       further training or  who already have the right background for the opening

               External recruitment
                   ▪  Can be important when:
                          –  A firm cannot get all the employees they need from the current staff
                          –  When the firm wants to inject a new perspective into running the
                              organization
               External sources
                   ▪  Advertising
                   ▪  Colleges
                   ▪  Agencies
                   ▪  Agency Search and Selection
                   ▪  Head Hunting
                   ▪  Open Evening
                   ▪  Referrals and walk –ins
                   ▪  Recruitment on the internet

               Advertising
                   ▪  For this to be successful the firm must address tow issues:
                   ▪  The advertising media
                   ▪  The advert construction

               Advertising media
                   ▪  The selection to the media  depends on the positions which the firm is recruiting
                       for
                   ▪  Local newspapers – for blue collar jobs and jobs whose labour is in plenty supply
                   ▪  Specialized jobs will be adverted in trade and professional journals like the
                       economists , etc
                   ▪  Jobs with an international focus will be advertised in international dailies or
                       magazines

               Constructing an Ad
                   ▪  Should have the following four point guide (AIDA):
                                 •  Attention – must attract attention to the Ad or readers may just
                                     miss it or ignore it
                                 •  Interest – you can create interest by the nature of the job itself, or
                                     with lines such as “will thrive on challenging work”, or use other
                                     aspects such as location
                                 •  Desire – by spotlighting the job interest factors with words such as
                                     travel or challenge



                                                             66]]></page><page Index="827"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY   Department of Management

                                 •  Action - Make sure the ad prompts action with statements such as
                                     “call today”
                   ▪  Should contain the following information:
                          ▪  Job content ( primary task and responsibilities)
                          ▪  A realistic description of the work conditions
                          ▪  The location of the job
                          ▪  The compensation including fringe benefits
                          ▪  Job specification (e.g. education and experience)
                          ▪  To whom one should apply

               Employment agencies
                   ▪  Agencies that charge employees or employers for the placement services
                   ▪  Major functions:
                   ▪  To increase the pool of possible applicants and to do preliminary screening

               Why turn to employment agencies
                   ▪  Your firm doesn’t have its own HR department and is not geared to doing
                       recruitment and screening
                   ▪  Your firm has found it difficult in the past to generate a pool if qualified applicants
                   ▪  You must fill a particular opening quickly
                   ▪  You want to reach currently employed individual who might feel more
                       comfortable dealing with agencies than with competing companies
                   ▪  You want to cut down on time you are devoting to interviewing

               Executive recruiters (headhunters)
                   ▪  Are special employment agencies retained by employers to seek out top
                       management talent for their clients
                   ▪  Usually for crucial execute and technical positions
                   ▪  Executive recruiters are  becoming more and more specialized  to recruit for
                       specific functions or industries

               Advantages
                   ▪  The recruiters may have many contacts and are especially experts and skilled  at
                       contacting qualified, currently employed candidates who aren't actively looking
                       for  a change in jobs
                   ▪  They can also keep the firms name confidential until  late into the search
                       processes
                   ▪  The recruiters save top management's time of advertising and screening
                   ▪  Pitfalls
                       as an employer, you  must explain completely what sort of candidate is required
                       and why,
                   ▪  Some recruiters are also sales people than professionals – they may be more
                       interested in persuading you to hire a candidate than finding one who will really
                       do the job

                   ▪  Recruiters also claim that what their clients say they want is often not accurate,
                       therefore be prepared for some in-depth dissecting of your request.

               College recruiting
                   ▪  Sending an employer’s representative to college campuses to prescreen
                       applicants and create an applicant, pool from that college graduating class is an
                       important source of management trainees, promotable candidates, and
                       professional and technical employees
                   ▪  Problems with on campus recruiting:
                   ▪  Its expensive and time consuming – schedules must be set well in advance,
                       company brochures printed, record of interview kept, and much time spent on
                       campus
                   ▪  Some recruiters are ineffective and/or show  little interest in the candidates and
                       act as superiors

               Referrals and walk-ins
                   ▪  The firm posts announcements of openings and request for referrals in its
                       bulleting and on its wall boards and intranet.
                   ▪  Pros:
                   ▪  Current employees can and usually provide accurate information about the job
                       applicants they are referring, especially since there are putting their own
                       reputation at risk
                   ▪  The new employee may come with more realistic  picture of what working in the
                       firm is like after speaking with friends there
                   ▪  Cons: employees bringing their friends who are not necessity  qualified

               Selection and Placement
                   ▪  Selection
                          –  The process of choosing individuals who have needed qualities to fill jobs
                              in an organization.
                          –  Organizations need qualified employees to succeed
                                 •  “Good training will not make up for bad selection.”
                                 •  “Hire hard, manage easy.”

               HR’s Role in Selection and Placement
                   ▪  Reasons for centralizing selection
                          –  Easier to have applicants in one place.
                          –  Contact with outside applicants is easier.
                          –  Managers can concentrate on operating responsibilities rather than the
                              selection process.
                          –  Selection costs are lower with no duplicated efforts.
                          –  EEO compliance is more assured.

                                                     Learning Styles



































               Learning Practices
                   ▪  Active Practice
                          –  The performance of job-related tasks and duties by trainees during
                              training
                   ▪  Spaced Practice
                          –  Several practice sessions spaced over a period of hours or days
                   ▪  Massed practice
                          –  Performance of all the practice at once.

               Learning: Behaviors
                   ▪  Behavior Modeling
                          –  Copying someone else’s behavior by observing how another person deals
                              with a problem.
                   ▪  Reinforcement
                          –  Law of effect states that people tend to repeat behaviors that are
                              rewarded and avoid behaviors that are punished.
                   ▪  Immediate Confirmation
                          –  Reinforcement and feedback are most effective when given as soon as
                              possible after training.

               Uses of Performance Appraisal
                   ▪  Performance Appraisal (PA)
                          –  The process of evaluating how well employees perform their jobs when
                              compared to a set of standards, and then communicating the information

                   ▪  Criticisms of Performance Appraisal
                          –  Focus is too much on the individual and does little to develop employees.
                          –  Employees and supervisors believe the appraisal process is seriously
                              flawed.
                          –  Appraisals are inconsistent, short-term oriented, subjective, and useful
                              only at the extremes of performance.

                              Consumer Price Index).
                   ▪  Lump-Sum Increases (LSI)
                          –  A one-time payment of all or part of a yearly pay increase.

                      THE IMPORTANCE OF BUSINESS ETHICS

               “There are two educations. One should teach us how to make a living and the other
               how to live.” – John Adams

               The Relationship between Ethics and Business
                   ❖  Business is an integral part of human society.
                   ❖  In business, as in any other human endeavor, “what is legal may not necessarily
                       be moral.”
                   ❖  Laws are insufficient. They cannot cover all aspects of our human behavior.
                   ❖  Managers and leaders must also be prepared to respond to complex situations
                       bearing ethical consequences.
                   ❖  Peter Drucker argues that “the business enterprise is an organ of society and its
                       actions have a decisive impact on the social scene.”

               Business Ethics
               Ethics is a part of decision making at all levels of work and management
                   ❖  As important as functional areas of business
                   ❖  Questions whether practices are acceptable
                   ❖  There are no universally accepted approaches for resolving issues
               Comprises organizational principles, values, and norms that may originate from
               individuals, organizational statements, or from the legal system that primarily guide
               individual and group behavior in business
                   ❖  Ethical decisions occur when accepted rules no longer serve and decision
                       makers must weigh values and reach a judgment
                          ➢  Values and judgments play a critical role when we make ethical decisions
                   ❖  Morals:  Refer to a person’s personal philosophies about what is right or wrong
                          ➢  Morals are personal and singular
                   ❖  Principles:  Specific and pervasive boundaries for behavior that should not be
                       violated

                          ➢  Human rights, freedom of speech and justice
                   ❖  Values:  Enduring beliefs and ideals that are socially enforced
                          ➢  Teamwork, trust and integrity

               A Crisis in Business Ethics
               Nearly half of employees observe at least one form of misconduct in the workplace
                   ❖  After the financial crisis, business decisions and activities have come under
                       scrutiny
                   ❖  The financial sector has not fully regained stakeholder trust

                                                GOVERNANCE


               Relationship and Business
               Building effective relationships is one of the most important areas  of business today
                          ➢  Business ethics is a team sport and few decisions are made by only one
                              individual
                   ❖  Stakeholder framework
                          ➢  Helps identify internal and external stakeholders
                          ➢  Helps monitor and respond to needs, values, and expectations of
                              stakeholder groups
                   ❖  Corporate governance
                          ➢  The formal system of accountability and control of ethical and socially
                              responsible behavior

               Stakeholders Define Ethical Issues in Business
               Stakeholders: Those who have a stake or claim in some aspect of a company’s
               products, operations, markets, industry, and outcomes
                       Customers                   Investors
                       Employees                   Suppliers
                       Government agencies         Communities
               The relationship between companies and their stakeholders is a two-way street

               Identifying Stakeholders
               Primary stakeholders: those whose continued association is absolutely necessary for
               a firm’s survival
                          ➢  Employees, customers, investors, governments, and communities
               Secondary stakeholders: do not typically engage in transactions with the firm and are
               not essential to a firm’s survival
                          ➢  Media, trade associations, and special interest groups

                       instantly and for years afterwards

               Views of Corporate Governance

                   ❖  Shareholder model
                          ➢  Founded in classic economic precepts
                          ➢  Maximizing wealth for investors and owners
                   ❖  Stakeholder model
                          ➢  A broader view of the purpose of business
                          ➢  Includes satisfying concerns of primary stakeholders including employees,
                              suppliers, regulators, communities and special interest groups

               Role of Board of Directors
               Holds final responsibility for its firm’s success, failure, and ethicality of actions
                   ❖  The global financial crisis motivated many to demand greater accountability from
                       boards
                   ❖  In reality, boards rarely manage but instead monitor executive decisions
                   ❖  Executive compensation is a growing ethical concern

               Demand for Accountability and Transparency
               Stakeholders demand that boards are accountable and transparent
                   ❖  Directors offer expertise, competence, and diverse perspectives to strategic
                       decisions
                   ❖  Qualified, knowledgeable, diverse, unbiased boards can prevent misconduct

               Interlocking directorate is the concept of board members being linked to more than one
               company

               Executive Compensation
               Many boards spend more time discussing compensation than ensuring integrity of
               financial reporting systems
                   ❖  How closely linked is executive compensation to company performance?
                   ❖  Does performance-linked compensation encourage executives to focus on short-
                       term performance at the expense of long-term growth?

               Recognizing an Ethical Issue
                   ❖  An ethical issue is simply a situation, a problem, or even an opportunity that
                       requires thought, discussion, or investigation to make a decision.

               4. Ethics and Economics














               According to Charles K. Wilber (1986), there are three ways in which ethics enters
               economics.
                   1.  Economists have ethical values that help shape the way they do
                       economics.
                   2.  Economic actors (consumers, workers, business owners) have ethical values
                       that help shape their behavior.
                   3.  Economic institutions and policies impact people differentially and thus, ethical
                       evaluations, in addition to economic evaluations are important.

                               Relationship of Ethics with other Phases of Human Life
               1. Ethics and Law












               2. Ethics and Religion











               Religion and Ethics both suggest and assume the existence of God who created
               everything, man's freewill and the immorality of the soul.Moreover, ethics and religion
               have the same end or purpose -that is, the atttainment of man's happiness in this life
               and beyond. Lastly, ethics and religion prescribe right living as the means of attaining
               the goal of man in this world.

                    THE INSTITUTIONALIZATION OF BUSINESS

                                                       ETHICS


               Institutionalization in Business Ethics
               Three dimensions of institutionalization
                   ❖  Voluntary practices: Beliefs, values, and voluntary contractual obligations of a
                       business
                          ➢  Philanthropy: Giving back to communities and causes
                   ❖  Core practices: Documented best practices, often encouraged by legal and
                       regulatory forces and trade associations
                   ❖  Mandated boundaries: Externally imposed boundaries of conduct (e.g. laws,
                       rules, regulations and other requirements)

               Legal Compliance
               Government established laws/regulations
                          ➢  Set minimum standards for responsible behavior
                   ❖  Stakeholders demanded laws involving consumer safety and environmental
                       protection
                   ❖  Laws help businesses determine what society believes at a certain time, but laws
                       change
                          ➢  Telling employees to ‘obey the law’ is meaningless without training in legal
                              risk areas

                   ❖  Obedience to authority: Helps to explain why many employees unquestioningly
                       follow superior’s orders

               Opportunity
               The conditions in an organization that limit/permit ethical/unethical behavior
                   ❖  Immediate job context: Where employees work, with whom they work, and the
                       nature of the work
                   ❖  Opportunities for misconduct can be reduced by establishing formal codes,
                       policies, and rules
                          ➢  Aggressive enforcement is required

               Impossible to objectively determine if a business decision is right or wrong
                   ❖  Understanding how ethical decisions are made will not solve ethical problems
                          ➢  Business ethics involves value judgments and collective agreement about
                              acceptable patterns of behavior
                   ❖  Ethical decision making in business does not rely on personal values and morals
                   ❖  Knowledge of moral philosophies or principles must be balanced with business
                       knowledge and understanding of complexities of the dilemma

                INDIVIDUAL FACTORS: MORAL PHILOSOPHIES

                                                 AND VALUES


               Moral Philosophy Defined
               The specific principles or values people use to decide right from wrong
                   ❖  Person-specific
                   ❖  Guidelines for determining how to settle conflicts and optimize mutual benefit
                   ❖  Provide direction in formulating strategies and resolving ethical issues
               :No single moral philosophy is accepted by everyone

               Value Orientation
                   ❖  Economic value orientation: Values that can be quantified by monetary means
                          ➢  If an act produces value, accept it as ethical
                   ❖  Idealism: Places special value on ideas and ideals as products of the mind
                          ➢  Positive correlation to ethical decision-making
                   ❖  Realism: The view that an external world exists independent of our perceptions
                          ➢  Everyone is guided by self-interest
                          ➢  Negative correlation to ethical decision-making

               Goodness – Instrumental and Intrinsic
                   ❖  Monists believe that only one thing is intrinsically good
                          ➢  Hedonism: Pleasure is the ultimate good
                                 ❖  Qualitative hedonism
                                 ❖  Quantitative hedonism
                   ❖  Pluralists believe that no one thing is intrinsically good
                   ❖  Instrumentalists reject the ideas that
                          ➢  Ends can be separated from the means
                          ➢  Ends, purposes, or outcomes are intrinsically good in and of themselves
               Instrumental and Intrinsic Goodness
                   ❖  Goodness theories: Focus on the end result of actions and the goodness or
                       happiness created by them
                   ❖  Obligation theories: Emphasize the means and motives by which actions are
                       justified
                          ➢  Divided into two categories
                                 ❖  Teleology
                                 ❖  Deontology
               Teleology
               Considers acts as morally right or acceptable if they produce a desired result

                          ➢  Pleasure, knowledge, career growth, realization of  self-interest, utility,
                              wealth or even fame
                   ❖  Theological philosophies assess the moral worth of a behavior by looking at the
                       consequences, so these theories are often referred to as Consequentialism
               Egoism in Teleology
               Two important teleological philosophies are egoism and utilitarianism
                   ❖  Egoism defines right or acceptable behavior in terms of consequences to the
                       individual
                          ➢  Maximizes personal interests
                   ❖  Enlightened egoists: Take a long-term perspective and allow for the well-being
                       of others though their own self-interests remain paramount

               Utilitarianism in Teleology
               Utilitarianism seeks the greatest good for the greatest number of people
                   ❖  Rule utilitarians: Determine behavior based on principles designed to promote
                       the greatest utility
                   ❖  Act utilitarians: Examine a specific action itself; not the rules governing it
               Deontology
               Moral philosophies focusing on the rights of individuals and on the intentions associated
               with a particular behavior
                          ➢  Believe individuals have certain absolute rights
                          ➢  Believe compliance with stable moral principles defines ethicalness
                          ➢  Sometimes referred to as nonconsequentialism, a system of ethics based
                              on respect for persons
                   ➢  Rule deontologists: Conformity to general moral principles determines
                       ethicalness
                   ➢  Act deontologists: Actions are the proper basis on which to judge morality

               Relativist Perspective
               Individuals and groups derive definitions of ethical behavior subjectively from
               experience
                   ❖  Descriptive relativism: Relates to observations of other cultures
                   ❖  Metaethical relativism: Proposes people see situations from their own
                       perspectives
                          ➢  No objective way of resolving ethical disputes between different value
                              systems and individuals
                   ❖  Normative relativism: Assumes one person’s opinion is as good as another’s
               Virtue Ethics
               Ethical behavior follows conventional moral standards and compares behavior against
               a standard “good” moral character
                   ❖  Can be summarized as
                          ➢  Good corporate ethics programs encourage individual virtue and integrity
                          ➢  The virtues associated with appropriate conduct form a good person
                          ➢  The ultimate purpose is to serve the public good

                          ➢  The well-being of the community goes together with individual excellence

               Justice
               Fair treatment and due reward in accordance with ethical or legal standards
                   ❖  Distributive justice: An evaluation of the results of a business relationship
                   ❖  Procedural justice: Considers the processes and activities that produce desired
                       outcomes
                   ❖  Interactional justice: Based on relationships between organizational members,
                       including employees and managers

               Moral Philosophy and Ethical Decision Making
               Individuals use different moral philosophies for personal decisions than they use for
               work-related decisions
                   ❖  Two things may explain this behavior
                          ➢  Pressures for workplace success differ from the goals and pressures in
                              outside life
                          ➢  Morale character may change to become compatible with the work
                              environment
               Moral philosophies must be assessed on a continuum
               Kohlberg’s Model of Cognitive Moral Development
               Consists of six stages
                   1.  Punishment and obedience – defines right as literal obedience to rules and
                       authority
                   2.  Individual instrumental purpose and exchange – defines right as that which
                       serves his or her own needs.
                   3.  Mutual interpersonal expectations, relationships, and conformity –
                       emphasizes others rather than him or herself
                   4.  Social system and conscience maintenance – considering his/her duty to
                       society
                   5.  Prior rights, social contract, or utility – upholding basic rights, values and
                       legal contracts of society
                   6.  Universal ethical principles – determined by universal principle that everyone
                       should follow

               Kohlberg’s Model
               Reduced to three levels of ethical concern
                   1.  Concern with immediate interests and rewards and punishments
                   2.  Concern with right as expected by the larger society or some significant
                       reference group
                   3.  Seeing beyond norms, laws, and the authority of groups or individuals

               Importance and Problems Kohlberg’s Theory
                   ❖  Shows that individuals can change their values through moral development
                   ❖  Supports management’s development of employee’s moral principles

                                                             50]]></page><page Index="945"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY Department of Management

               However, the three hit theory says
                   ❖  Kohlberg used questionable research methods
                   ❖  His theory contradicts basic moral philosophy
                   ❖  His theory, while reliable, may not be valid

               White Collar Crime
               Illegal acts committed for personal and/or organizational gain by abusing the trust and
               authority associated with a given position
                   ❖  White collar criminals are educated people in positions of power and
                       respectability
                   ❖  The financial sector has a high level of WCCs
                   ❖  WCCs are increasing steadily
                          ➢  Technology allows WCCs to be committed at all levels, not just the top
                              levels of management
                          ➢  Resulting in increased government efforts to detect and punish WCCs

               Reasons for White Collar Crime
                   ❖  Patterns of activities become institutionalized and may encourage unethical
                       behaviors
                   ❖  Undecided employees go along with the majority, whether ethical or unethical
                   ❖  WCCs increase after economic recessions
                   ❖  Some businesspeople may have inherently criminal personalities, corporate
                       psychopaths

               Individual Factors
                   ❖  Most unethical behavior is not for personal gain, but to meet performance goals
                   ❖  Rewards for performance goals and corporate culture in general are the most
                       important drivers of ethical decision making

                   ORGANIZATIONAL FACTORS: THE ROLE OF

                      ETHICAL CULTURE AND RELATIONSHIPS



               Defining Corporate Culture
               Corporate culture has many definitions
                   ❖  A set of values, norms, and artifacts, including ways of solving problems shared
                       by organizational members
                   ❖  The shared beliefs top managers have about how they should manage
                       themselves and other employees and how they should conduct their business
                   ❖  Gives organizational members meaning and sets the internal rules of behavior
                          ➢  All organizations have culture
                   ❖  May be formal through statements of values, beliefs, and customs
                          ➢  Comes from upper management
                          ➢  Memos, codes, manuals, forms, ceremonies
                   ❖  May be informal through direct or indirect comments conveying management’s
                       wishes
                          ➢  Dress codes, promotions, extracurricular activities
                   ❖  The “tone at the top” is critical in creating ethical corporate culture

               Two Dimensions of Organizational Culture
                   ❖  Concern for people
                          ➢  The organization’s efforts to care for its employees’ well-being
                   ❖  Concern for performance
                          ➢  The organization’s efforts to focus on output and employee productivity

               Four Organizational Culture Types
                   ❖  Apathetic:  Minimal concern for people or performance
                   ❖  Caring:  High concern for people; minimal concern for performance
                   ❖  Exacting:  Minimal concern for people; high concern for performance
                   ❖  Integrative:  High concern for people and performance

               A cultural audit is an assessment of the organization’s values
                          ❖  Usually conducted by outside consultants; can be handled internally

                                 Company Examples of Four Organizational Culture























               Ethics and Corporate Culture
                   ❖  Ethical corporate culture is a significant factor in ethical decision making
                   ❖  If a firm’s culture encourages/rewards/does not monitor unethical behavior,
                       employees may act unethically
                   ❖  Management’s sense of an organizational culture may differ from that guiding
                       employees

               Compliance versus Value-Based Cultures
                   ❖  Compliance-based cultures use a legalistic approach to ethics
                          ➢  Revolve around risk management, not ethics
                          ➢  Lack of long-term focus and integrity
                   ❖  Value-based cultures rely on mission statements that define the firm and
                       stakeholder relations
                          ➢  Focus on values, not laws
                          ➢  Top-down integrity is critical

               Differential Association
               The idea that people learn ethical/unethical behavior while interacting with others
                   ❖  Studies support that differential association supports ethical decision making
                   ❖  Superiors have a strong influence on subordinates
                   ❖  Employees may go along with superiors’ moral judgments to show loyalty

               Whistle-Blowing
               Exposing an employer’s wrongdoing to company outsiders

               Leaders Influence Corporate Culture
                   ❖  An effective leader is one who does well for the stakeholders of the corporation
                          ➢  Effective leaders are good at getting followers to common goals effectively
                              and efficiently
                   ❖  Power refers to the influence that leaders and managers have over the behavior
                       and decisions of subordinates
                          ➢  A individual has power when his/her presence causes people to behave
                              differently
                   ❖  Power and influence shape corporate culture

               Five Power Bases
                   ❖  Reward power:  Offering something desirable to influence behavior
                   ❖  Coercive power:  Penalizing negative behavior
                   ❖  Legitimate power:  The consensus that a person has the right to exert influence
                       over others
                   ❖  Expert power:  Derives from knowledge and credibility with subordinates
                   ❖  Referent power:  Exists when goals or objectives are similar

               Motivation
               A force within the individual that focuses behavior toward achieving a goal
                   ❖  Job performance:  A function of ability and motivation
                   ❖  An individual’s hierarchy of needs may influence motivation and ethical behavior
                          ➢  Relatedness needs:  Satisfied by social and interpersonal relationships
                          ➢  Growth needs:  Satisfied by creative or productive activities
                   ❖  Needs or goals may change over time

               Centralized Organizational Culture
               Decision making authority is concentrated in the hands of top-level managers
                   ❖  Little authority delegated to lower levels
                   ❖  Best for organizations…
                          ➢  That make high-risk decisions
                          ➢  Whose lower-level managers are not skilled in decision-making
                          ➢  Where processes are routine
                   ❖  May have a harder time responding to ethical issues

               Decentralized Organizational Culture
               Decision making authority is delegated as far down the chain of command as possible
                   ❖  Flexible and quicker to recognize external change
                   ❖  Can be slow to recognize organizational policy changes
                   ❖  Units may diverge and develop different value systems
                          ➢  Ethical misconduct may result

               Can people control their actions within a corporate culture?
               Ethical decisions are often made by committees and formal and informal groups
                   ❖  Many decisions are beyond the influence of individuals
                   ❖  Congruence between individual and organizational ethics—increases potential
                       for making ethical decisions
                   ❖  Individuals need experience to understand how to resolve ethical issues

                              business conduct
                          ➢  Corporate culture without values and appropriate communication about
                              ethics can facilitate individual misconduct
                                 ➢  Ethical corporate culture does not evolve, but requires ethical
                                     policies
                                 ➢  Implementing a corporate ethics program promotes the corporation
                                     as a moral agent

               The Need for Organizational Ethics Programs
                          ❖  Ethics programs increase ethical awareness
                   ❖  Some people are simple “bad apples”
                          ❖  Always do things in their own self-interest regardless of their org goals or
                              accepted standards of conduct
                   ❖  Organizations can become bad barrels
                          ❖  Pressures to succeed create opportunities that reward unethical decisions
                   ❖  Established ethics programs help employees determine what behaviors are
                       acceptable
                          ❖  Top management must integrate these codes, values and standards into
                              the corporate culture

               Components of Strong Ethics Program
               A strong ethics program includes
                          ❖  Written codes of conduct
                          ❖  Ethics officers to oversee the program
                          ❖  Careful delegation of authority
                          ❖  Formal ethics training
                          ❖  Rigorous auditing, monitoring, enforcement, and revision of program
                              standards

                                    Goals of Successful Ethics Training Programs





























               Systems to Monitor and Enforce Ethical Standards
               Effective programs employ various methods to measure effectiveness
                          ❖  Observing employees
                          ❖  Internal audits and investigations
                          ❖  Surveys
                          ❖  Reporting systems
                          ❖  External audits
               Consistent enforcement and necessary disciplinary action are essential to a functional
               ethics or compliance program

               Continuous Improvement
               Improving a system differs little from implementing any other business strategy
                   ❖  To improve its ethical performance, a company may change how it makes
                       decisions
                          ➢  Centralize decisions, or decentralize them
                   ❖  The key is to delegate authority carefully so the organization can achieve ethical
                       performance

               Common Design and Implementation Mistakes
                   ❖  Failure to understand and appreciate goals
                   ❖  Setting unrealistic/immeasurable objectives
                   ❖  Unsupportive top management
                   ❖  Ineffective or incomprehensible content
                   ❖  Designing a program that is little more than a series of lectures resulting in low
                       recall

                       and procedures
                   ❖  Can be a precursor to establishing an ethics program
                   ❖  Should be the most important part of an ethics program
                   ❖  Primary purpose is to identify risks and problems in activities and plan steps to

                   ❖  No guarantee that auditing is the solution
                   ❖  Lack of standardization in auditing

               The Auditing Process
               Audits should be unique to each company

                                 GLOBALIZATION OF ETHICAL

                                            DECISION MAKING


               Capitalism, Economics and Business Ethics
                                                  st
                   •  The first decade of the 21  century was a turbulent one
                          –  Ethical misconduct and excessive risk-taking seemed rampant
                          –  Many stakeholders lost confidence in businesses
                   •  Lack of fairness, trust and honesty made stakeholders question the stability of
                       major institutions, as well as the intentions of executives
                   •  Even the competence of governmental regulatory institutions was called into
                       question

               Risk Compartmentalization
                   •  Occurs when profit centers within an organization are unaware of the
                       consequences of their decisions on the organization as a whole
                          –  No single person can be blamed for negative outcomes that occur
                              because of systemic problems



















               Key Figures in Modern Economics
                   •  Adam Smith
                          –  Laissez-faire capitalism (the market through its on inherent mechanisms
                              will keep commerce in equilibrium)
                   •  John Maynard Keynes
                          –  Stimulate growth and improve stability in the private sector through
                              controlling interest rates, taxation and public projects
                   •  Milton Friedman
                          –  Believed in deregulation, the system could reach equilibrium without gov’t
                              intervention


                                                             77]]></page><page Index="972"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY Department of Management

               Keynes and Friedman Agreed That:
                   •  People have rational preferences among outcomes that can be identified and
                       associated with value
                   •  Individuals seek to maximize utility and firms seek to maximize profits
                   •  People act independently on the basis of full and relevant information

               Capitalism, Economics and Business Ethics
                   •  Socialism: Advocates that wealth and power be shared equally across society
                       based on the amount of work expended in production
                          –  Karl Marx was the most famous advocate
                   •  Social democracy formed in the 1940s as an offshoot of socialism
                          –  Private ownership of property, but large government to offer services to
                              citizens
                   •  Current global economic system has created bimodal wealth distribution: The
                       middle class shrinks so that there are many poor and a few very wealthy

               Two Schools of Economic Thought
                   •  Rational economics: Assumes that people are rational and base their decisions
                       on maximizing their utility based on the amount of resources available to them
                   •  Behavioral economics: Assumes that humans do not always act rationally
                          –  Also believes that how information is presented can affect people’s
                              choices, which is called the framing effect
               Common Values, Goals, and Business Practices
                   •  Global common values: Shared across most cultures
                   •  Country cultural values: Specific to certain groups that express actions, behavior
                       and intent
                   •  Culture: Everything in our surroundings that is made by people
                          –  Each nation has a distinctive culture beliefs about what business activities
                              are acceptable
                          –  Subcultures can also be found within many nations

               Cultural Differences
                   •  Can become liabilities when firms transfer personnel
                          –  One significant area of cultural differences is                        language
                          –  Cultural differences in body language can also lead to misunderstandings
                          –  Perceptions of time may differ

               Global Business Practices
                   •  The Self-reference criterion (SRC): An implied perspective of ethical superiority is
                       common
                          –  SRC is an unconscious reference to one’s own cultural values,
                              experiences, and knowledge
                          –  We react on the basis of knowledge, which is accumulated over a lifetime
                              and grounded in the culture of origin.

               Global Business
                   •  Dumping: The practice of charging high prices for products sold in domestic
                       markets while selling the same products in foreign markets at low prices, often
                       below the costs of exporting them
                          –  The U.S. has multiple anti-dumping laws

               Cultural Relativism
                   •  The concept that morality varies from one culture to another
                   •  There is a continuum of cultural relativism
                          –  Some believe that only one culture defines ethical behavior for the whole
                              globe
                          –  For the business relativist, there may be no ethical standards except for
                              the one in the transaction culture, or none at all. These people may be in
                              conflict with their own individual moral standards.

                        Matrix for Global Relativists When Making Cross-Cultural Decisions





























               Consumerism
                   •  The belief that consumers, not the interests of corporations, should dictate the
                       economic structure of society
                          –  Belief that consumption of goods relates to increased well being
                          –  Made-to-break (planned obsolescence) encourages consumers to
                              regularly buy more items
                   •  Consumerism meeting with backlash because of increased sustainability
                       concerns

               Human Rights
                   •  Defined as an inherent dignity that should be afforded all people with equal and

                   •  The issue of healthcare availability and affordability for workers in all nations is
                       becoming a major source of concern
                   •  Question remains of whether access to
                       healthcare is a right or a privilege

               Labor
                   •  More people than ever work in nations other than their homeland
                   •  Doing business in many different countries, firms today have many ethical
                       concerns involving labor issues
                   •  A corporation must always know where the labor comes from in its entire supply
                       chain so as to avoid controversy
                   •  Corporations that do not take labor issues seriously will find themselves in legal
                       and ethical trouble

               Sustainable Development
                   •  Is a systematic approach to achieving development in such a way that the earth’s
                       resources are preserved for future generations
                          –  Will be a serious issue for most firms in the future
                   •  Some companies conduct their own sustainability performance reports

               The International Monetary Fund
                   •  The IMF emerged from the Bretton Woods agreement of 1944
                   •  The IMF assumed a major role in the 1980s in the management of the less
                       developed countries (LDC) debt crisis
                   •  An ethical issue surrounding the IMF has to do with the increased inequality in
                       LDCs
                          –  Some contend that foreign corporations offload their debt via IMF bailouts
               The World Trade Organization
                   •  The WTO was established in 1995 and now includes 133 member nations and
