                    A shell or seashell, additionally referred to just as a shell, is a hard, defensive external

               layer for the most part made by a creature that lives in the ocean. The shell is important for

               the body of the creature. Void shells are frequently tracked down appeared on sea shores by

               wanderers. The shells are unfilled in light of the fact that the creature has kicked the bucket

               and the delicate parts have deteriorated or been eaten by another creature.

                    A shell is normally the exoskeleton of an invertebrate (a creature without a spine), and is

               ordinarily made out of calcium carbonate or chitin. Most shells that are found on sea shores


               are the shells of calcium carbonate, and bear better compared to shells made or chitin.

                    Aside from mollusk shells, different shells that can be found on sea shores are those of

               barnacles, horseshoe crabs and brachiopods. Marine annelid worms in the family Serpulidae

               make shells which are tubes made of calcium carbonate solidified onto different surfaces. The

               shells of ocean imps are designated ‘tests’, and the shed shells of crabs and lobsters are


               exuviae. While most shells are outside, a few cephalopods have interior shells.

                    Our product which is Luscious Seashell can use as gifts or souvenir in any events, it can

               also use as decoration in house specially in kitchen or dining room.

                    Shells have been utilized by people for various purposes since the beginning and ancient

               times.  In  any  case,  shells  are  not  by  any  means  the  only  sort  of  shells;  in  different

               environments, there are shells from freshwater creatures, for example, freshwater mussels

               and freshwater snails, and shells of land snails.]]></page><page Index="26"><![CDATA[PRODUCT OVERVIEW





               I. Product Concept

                    Seashells or simply shells have various types and sizes. Animals from the sea are the

               ones who usually create it. These shells are mostly collected from around the world because

               of its vivid and unique construction. They are used for decorations, jewelry and buttons in the

               industry. Hence, they are not only used as display but also some of them can be eaten. These


               shells also help the country’s economy because of its uses and can be a great medium for

               researches.

                    Since Philippines is surrounded by bodies of water, we can’t deny that or country is fond

               of seashells. Plenty of handicrafts and decorations are being made of it. In 2016, Department

               of science and Technology (DOST) granted to boost the Capiz’ handicraft production in Cavite


               known in the Philippines as the mother-of-pearl shells. The granted them a new set of planting

               facility  with  complete  accessories  and  low-cost  furnace  dry  to  develop  and  enhance  the

               production capacity and quality. Through this, Cavite will be able to promote the importance

               of seashells to the industry and spread awareness on how these shells help or ecology to

               move forward. According to the 2001 Fisheries Administrative Order 208 of Philippines Laws,

               they must protect and conserve the rare, threatened and endangered species od shells from

               the people who collects and damages them only for their personal purposes.


                    We may think that shells are just shells but to biodiversity and ecology they mean so much

               than just a decoration. Shells are said to be the major players in the web of life. Once they are

               wiped out it would result in ecological imbalance that would result not only to our loss but also

               to the animals who mostly relies on it. It serves as the shelter of smaller marine lifeforms and

               some of kind of crabs. Some shells help fight the ocean acidification and the removal of large

               shells will also affect the rate of shore erosion.]]></page><page Index="27"><![CDATA[II. Market Size

                    According to Paul Zahl Ph. D. of National Geographic (1969), Philippines together with its


               thousands of islands, reefs and marine habitats, the country is considered a mecca of sea

               shell collectors. Along the vast region of the Philippines lies the Indo-Pacific region of the

               Philippines lies the Indo-Pacific region which contains the world’s most diverse sea shells.

               One of the best hunting grounds are said to be in the islands of Sulu Sea and also the province

               of Cavite.


                    There are 12,000 or more species of seashells in the Philippines, both the largest shells,

               Tridacna gigas, and smallest shells, Pisidum, can be found on the Philippines waters. Not only

               does the country has beautiful seashells but also has shells that can be eaten. It is common

               in Philippine cuisine to have different foods with shells such as mussels, mollusks and oyster.

                    Also, based on the study by Solidum, J.N (2011), several coastal islands especially the

               province of Cavite, produce most of the various types of shell waste that are normally thrown

               away on open garbage areas which somehow cause numerous problems to the citizens. So,


               in order to lessen the wastes being deployed, the wastes being reused and recycled. One of

               the products which clearly shows the reuse and recycle method is the Luscious Seashells. It

               consists  of  shells  that  are  beautifully  arranged  and  gathered  in  a  glass  dome  to  use  as

               decoration.

               III. Consumer Trends

               many more. People who have a great fashion attitude use to decorate their own room to make

               it more look beautiful and good in their own eyes. Besides they also did that for them to impress

               who visits their room. Seashells are the number one that comes to our mind that can use for

               decoration because are easy to find yet net expensive. But there are people who don’t know

               the value of seashells until you recycled it. So that we decided to make Luscious Seashells

                       In order for a country to succeed as a nation, it requires that its leaders observe and

               practice  good  governance  in  the  performance  of  their  duties  as  public  officials.  Good

               governance is defined by UNESCAP as the process of decision-making and the process by


               which  decisions  are  implemented  (or  not  implemented).  While,  Social  responsibility  is  an

               ethical  theory  in  which  individuals  are  accountable  for  fulfilling  their  civic  duty,  and  the


               actions  of  an  individual  must  benefit  the  whole  of  society.  In  this  way,  there  must  be  a

               balance  between  economic  growth  and  the  welfare  of  society  and  the  environment.


               (Pachama,2021) Looking into the barangay level, good governance is also being expected by

               the government and of the people. As stipulated in the Local Government Code of 1991, “the

               chief executive of the  Barangay is  given with  executive power for  efficient,  effective and


               economical governance, the purpose of which is the general welfare of the barangay and its


               people. Along this line, the Sangguniang Barangay members shall enact ordinances as may

               be necessary to discharge the responsibilities conferred upon it by law or ordinance and to

               promote the general welfare of the people.” As such, all the elected officials are expected to


               perform their functions accordingly, most especially considering the interests of all residents

               through  good  governance.  In  order  to  address  the  issues  and  concerns  in  the  community,


               resolutions and ordinances are being crafted by the barangay officials, “the barangay serves

               as  the  primary  planning  and  implementing  unit  of  government  policies,  plans,  programs,


               projects and activities in the community.”  Its roles in nation-building really matter. Given

               this demanding role, it is only proper and correct to assess the capacity readiness of every

               Brgy. Officials in delivering expected outcomes to their respective community.



                       Barangay Lambingan is a barangay in the municipality of Tanza, in the province of

               Cavite. Its population as determined by the 2015 Census was 1,850. This represented 0.82%


               of the total population of Tanza.]]></page><page Index="41"><![CDATA[A  barangay  is  the  smallest  administrative  division  in  the  Philippines  it has  several

               powers, duties,  and functions.  The Punong Barangay  is  the one who  enforce all laws and


               ordinances;  maintain  public order;  ensure the delivery of basic services;  enforce laws and

               regulations relating to pollution control and protection of the environment; adopt measures to


               prevent  and  control  the  proliferation  of  squatters;  and  adopt  measures  to  prevent  and

               eradicate  drug  abuse,  child  abuse,  and  juvenile  delinquency.  While  the  Sangguniang


               Barangay  can  enact  ordinances;  levy  taxes  and  other  revenue  measures;  provide  for

               construction and maintenance of barangay facilities and other public works; regulate use of


               public facilities, including waterworks; etc.

                       This section discusses the review of related literature concept and study about Good

               Governance and Social Responsibility of Brgy. Officials.


                       The barangay, which is the focus of this study, is the basic political unit which serves


               as  the  primary  planning  and  implementing  unit  of  government  policies.  Performance  is

               equated  with  the  local  government’s  responses  to  the  community’s  needs,  particularly  the


               provision of basic and essential public services. High performance is the result of rational

               decision-making; optimal use of resources such as funds, personnel, equipment, etc.; and the


               delivery  of  basic  public  services  in  a  timely  and  sustained  manner.  Performance  can  be

               assessed in terms of the local governments’ capabilities to respond to the community’s need


               for  basic  essential  services.  Local  government  performance  is  then  measurable  through

               discernible improvement in the quality of life of individuals, the society as a whole, and more

               importantly the poor. (Acosta, 1991)



                       In  assessing  the  delivery  of  services  in  the  social,  economic,  political,  and

               environmental sectors, Functionality performance is used. In Functionality Performance, the


               degree of productivity is determined by comparing the actual LGU services against service

               standards  prescribed  by  the  national  government  agencies  concerned.  On  the  other  hand,


               Service  Delivery  Outcome  Assessment  is  used  to  determine  the  effect  of  the  services

               delivered by the LGUs to the citizen’s quality of life, particularly the impact of the services to


               the  socioeconomic  conditions  of  the  residents,  especially  the  poor.  (World  Academy  of

               Science, Engineering and Technology International Journal of Economics and Management

               Engineering Vol:2, No:10, 2008)



                       In the Philippines, through the Department of Interior and Local Government, Seal of

               Good Local Governance for Barangay Assessment (SGLGB) is one of the most commonly]]></page><page Index="46"><![CDATA[used  performance  indicator  systems  at  the  barangay  level.  It  is  a  self-assessment  LGU

               performance  by  measuring  multi  sectorial  impact  and  the  presence/number  of  services,


               facilities, projects, plans, programs, and policies, while emphasizing on good governance and

               administration. The result of the evaluation will guide the policy makers in making decisions


               towards the modification of their strategies in implementing a program. SGLGB can also be

               (DILG, 2001)


               Local  governments  also  have  a  very  crucial  role  to  play  in  the  attainment  of  government


               goals  under  the  Sustainable  Development  Goals  Declaration.  The  need  to  encourage  local

               governments  to  reallocate  resources  towards  basic  social  services  and  intensify  efforts

               towards  the  implementation  of  programs,  projects,  and  activities  that  are  responsive  to


               sustainable  Development  Goals  or  SDG  had  been  underscored  time  and  again.  The

               sustainable  Development  Goals  is  a  set  of  time-bound,  measurable  goals  and  targets  for


               combating The 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs) to transform the world: It consists

               of  17  goals  and  there  are  169  targets  for  the  17  goals.  Each  target  has  between  1  and  3


               indicators used to  measure progress  toward reaching the targets.  The  innovative strategies

               and tested approaches in promoting good governance and pursuing sustainable development,

               are  now  being  implemented  in  several  Philippine  communities.  Thus,  in  keeping  with  the

               Goals (SDGs) pick up where the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) left off. The SDGs


               set  forth  a  formidable  task  for  the  global  community  and  international  sustainable]]></page><page Index="47"><![CDATA[development over the next 15 years. Learning from the successes and failures of the MDGs,

               government  officials,  development  experts,  and  many  other  groups  understood  that


               localization is  necessary to  accomplish  the SDGs  but  how and what  to  localize  remain as

               questions to be answered. (Patole,2018)



                       According to Haslinda, Alia, and Faizah (2016) corporate social responsibility is the

               responsibility  of  companies  to  incorporate  the  economic,  legal,  ethical  and  philanthropic


               needs of the community in their business plans at a given time. This shows that firms should

               offer  some  things  that  communities  need.  Furthermore,  businesses  might  merely  have  a


               means of staying alive for a long time, if they accomplish their CSR activities. Likewise, the

               communities  should  encourage  and  assist  companies  to  attain  their  economic  goals,  this

               would be done through the provision of product safety and proper provision of employees’


               health facilities. Supplementary communities are anticipating the companies to perform their


               ethical  responsibilities,  through  making  their  business  activities  in  accord  with  societal

               values.  Finally,  voluntary  responsibilities  are  those  social  activities  required  by  the

               communities higher than economic, legal and ethical commitments.



                       The  concept  of  corporate  social  responsibility  is  a  straightforward  subject  of

               discussion  among  companies  and  stakeholders  that  continued  drawing  the  attention  of  the


               governance of the companies. This happened as a result of the requirements of the members

               of the community toward the need of businesses to include communities’ environmental and


               social problems into the company’s activity strategy since the company’s interests are beyond

               making  a  profit  to  only  shareholders,  but  to  both  stakeholders  and  shareholders.  The


               companies are expected to be more productive in thinking, more especially, on the ways and

               processes  of  alleviating  and  solving  the  needs  of  different  groups  of  stakeholders.

               Stakeholders comprise employees, government, members of the community, Consumers and


               the  owners  of  businesses  who  have  a  stake  in  a  company.  Moreover,  in  a  competitive]]></page><page Index="48"><![CDATA[business environment, companies are required to accommodate the interests of the different

               stakeholder  groups,  to  gain  image  and  reputation.  Besides,  firms  are  supposed  to  be


               accountable  and  open  to  the  stakeholders.  As  a  result,  owners  are  evaluating  companies,

               financial  performance  and  government  are  evaluating  companies’  compliance  with  the


               relevant legislation (Thi and Pham, 2018)


                       Epistemologically,  legitimacy  theory  describes  CSR  activities  conducted  by


               companies  as  a  standard,  ethics,  duties,  and  approaches  to  gaining  a  standard  legitimacy.

               Therefore,  legitimacy  is  a  process  of  making  the  company  being  suitable,  sustainable  and


               good to the members of the community as well as, making the companies operate under a

               socially  build  system  of  standards,  ethics,  and  beliefs  of  the  society.  (Odoemelam  and

               Okafor, 2018)



                       One notable study was that of Caldo (2015) who tried to link good governance to the

               competency of the barangay officials. He assessed the competency measures of the barangay


               council officials, and the findings show that the Punong Barangay and Sangguniang barangay

               members have strong belief that they are competent in performing their duties and functions;


               but this contradicts to the response of selected residents who said that they are uncertain to

               the performance of their barangay officials



                       According  to  Antal  Szerletics  (2000),  the  notion  of  good  governance  can  be

               conceived as a basket of many practices, including, for example, professional civil service,


               anti-corruption  policies,  transparency  and  accountability,  democratic  decision-making,  the

               principle  of  the  rule  of  law,  protection  of  human  rights  and  independent  judiciary.  The

               constitutive  elements  of  good  governance  vary  according  to  the  particular  international


               organization and the particular document we examine.]]></page><page Index="49"><![CDATA[According to Lipson (1965), Politics involves the fundamentals of social order with

               the formation of groups. Society is a system of groups which are the breeding grounds for


               politics.  Good  governance  can  foster  public  participation  in  policymaking  and  promote

               inclusion  in  decision-making  processes.  A  society  that  is  well  governed  should  provide


               maximum  opportunities  for  every  individual  to  realize  his  full  human  potential.  Thus,  by

               practicing  good  governance  in  a  basic  political  unit  such  as  the  barangay,  it  can  be  an


               effective tool for the promotion of the general welfare of the people, thus would serve as an

               assessment  for  the  performance  of  the  elective  barangay  officials.  This  inquiry  notes  that


               good  governance  of  a  barangay  can  be  affected  by  the  lack  of  capabilities  of  officials;

               is also a leader’s continuous exercise of authority over and the performance of functions for a

               political unit like the barangay. It refers to the organization, machinery or agency through


               which  a  political  unit  is  exercise,  authority  and  performs  functions  with  distribution  of

               powers to official or governing body. According to Robert Presthus (1975), political interest


               permeates the whole fabric of Government- a machinery or agency in which the political unit

               exercises authority and performs its functions. Public administration or governance works in


               a highly political environment. Politics searches for ends as well as means for the betterment

               of the society it serves: in terms of structure, political exercise, influences and attempts to

               bind  communities  on  political  issues.  According  to  Lipson  (1965),  Politics  involves  the


               fundamentals  of  social  order  with  the  formation  of  groups.  Society  is  a  system  of  groups


               which are the breeding grounds for politics. Good governance can foster public participation

               in policymaking and promote inclusion in decision-making processes. A society that is well

               governed  should  provide  maximum  opportunities  for  every  individual  to  realize  his  full


               human potential. Thus by  practicing  good governance in  a basic political  unit such as  the

               barangay, it can be an effective tool for the promotion of the general welfare of the people,


               thus would serve as an assessment for the performance of the elective barangay officials. This

               inquiry notes that good governance of a barangay can be affected by the lack of capabilities


               of  officials;  indecisiveness  during  assumption  of  duties  as  officers‐in‐charge.  Influence  of

               their siblings and family relatives and sensitivity of the issues and concerns being addressed.


               We cannot deny the fact that most of the people who run for political positions were mostly

               influenced by their family of traditional politicians, if not, most of them just rose to fame and


               won the election due to popularity, without considering the capability of that person, hence,

               disregarding their merits and competencies. The barangay being the basic political unit has]]></page><page Index="71"><![CDATA[always been at the forefront of local development undertakings in the country. Collectively,

               the barangays are partners of the national government to respond to development challenges


               because  of  their  strategic  situation  at  the  grassroots  level  especially  in  the  effective  and

               efficient  service  delivery  to  the  community.  The  synergy  created  51  INTERNATIONAL

               the city or the municipality. As the basic political unit, the barangay serves as the primary

               planning  and  implementing  unit  of  government  programs,  basic  services,  projects  and


               activities and as a forum in which the collective views of the people in the community may

               be crystallized and considered. Through the barangay assembly, people at the grassroots level


               may legislate directly on matters of local concerns, making it the nearest conduit to direct

               democracy in the Philippines. In the same manner, Republic Act 7160, otherwise known as

               the Local Government  Code of 1991 mandates that the barangay discharges three seminal


               functions: a) as a political unit b)as a primary planning and implementing unit and c) as a

               forum. As a basic political unit, the barangay is the smallest body politic used for governance


               in  the  country  being  a  political  subdivision  of  the  national  government.  As  a  primary

               planning and implementing unit, the barangay is mandated to plan development projects and


               programs and implement government policies and activities in the community, create projects

               in its territory and to deliver basic services of the government to the people. As a forum, the


               barangay gets the sound views of the people on various political topics. Moreover, it also

               provides  a  venue  for  settling  disputes  amicably.  In  society  today,  man  has  always


               encountered management challenges and peculiarities everywhere he goes. However, it does

               not necessarily mean that man has to enter politics in order to serve his people. Although, in

               today’s trend, man usually renders service to his fellowmen, if one positions himself in an


               elective office. Our society is increasingly dominated by the belief of individual merit. This]]></page><page Index="72"><![CDATA[belief is that people should achieve success through hard work and ability. This is seen as the

               fairest and most especially an efficient way to distribute the social status and marital rewards

                         The article discovers the congruence of governance principles and actual administrative


               practices  in  local  legislative  chamber  in  Nueva  Ecija,  Philippines.  By  using  case  study,  it

               measured  the  influence  of  governance  principles  to  legislative  performance  and


               organizational  effectiveness.  The  good  governance  principles  of  citizens’  participation,

               accountability  and  transparency  are  correlated  to  legislative  performance.  Inspired  by  the

               organization  theory  of  systems  model,  the  result  showed  that  there  is  a  link  between


               organizational  effectiveness,  legislative  performance  and  observance  of  good  governance

                         Governance is the establishment of policies, and continuous monitoring of their proper

               implementation  by the  members of the governing body of an organization.  It  includes  the


               mechanisms  required  to  balance  the  powers  of  the  members  with  the  associated

               accountability  and  their  primary  duty  of  enhancing  the  prosperity  and  viability  of  the


               organization.  Good  governance  is  about  the  processes  for  making  and  implementing

               decisions. It is not about making ‘correct’ decisions, but about the best possible process for

               making  those  decisions.  Good  decision-making  processes  and  good  governance  therefore


               share  several  characteristics.  Both  have  a  positive  effect  on  various  aspects  of  local]]></page><page Index="73"><![CDATA[government  including  consultation  on  policies  and  practices,  meeting  procedures,  service

               penalized.  Majority  of  the  residents  believed  that  the  inefficiency  was  caused  by

               on governance include: training on local governance, team building workshops (recollections

                         Governance is an act or a process of governing with power and performing the duties

               and  functions  within  one's  jurisdiction.  Barangay  governance  gives  an  important  role  in


               setting  direction  to  the  people  in  the  barangay  level.  It  is  an  empowerment  of  the  local


               government  units  in  the  country  where  this  present  study  is  interested.  This  quantitative-

                         How  well  does  the  Good  Governance  for  Local  Development  (GOFORDEV)  Index

               track the quality of local governance? This is the main question answered in this paper, which


               partially evaluates the sensitivity of the Index, as a whole, to its component indicators and its


               consistency with other similar indices using primary data. An empirical evaluation has now

               become necessary, given the myriad of indicators already developed, which all presumably

               have  been  vetted  for  their  theoretical  merits.  The  2001  compilation  of  indicators  of  good


               governance prepared by the Philippine Business for Social Progress (PBSP) already contains

               30 sets initiated by academic institutions, government agencies, civil society organizations


               and donor agencies. The list does not even include other previously adopted initiatives such

               as the DSWD’s Minimum Basic Needs (MBN) and the HDN-UNDP’s Human Development


               Index (HDI). Surely, however, the profusion of indicators systems is partly justified given the

               complexity  of  governance  issues  confronting  the  Philippines,  and  the  various  approaches

               taken toward these issues, which, in turn, then lead to diverse policy proposals and action


               programs for different stakeholders. Nonetheless, PBSP’s attempt at classification should be

               taken a step further towards consolidation and cooperation among the concerned proponents,


               if  only  to  re-channel  the  considerable  resources  spent  on  measurements  to  actual,  useful]]></page><page Index="77"><![CDATA[social  intervention  programs.  Approaches  at  consolidation  can  be  both  theoretical  and

               empirical.  But  where  the  indicators  systems  all  pass  theoretical  evaluation,  a  resort  to


               empirical tests will then help achieve the objective. Many of those in the PBSP’s list have

               been empirically verified, although at various levels. This paper presents the partial results of


               an attempt to validate the GOFORDEV Index, developed by the Philippine Center for Policy

               Studies (PCPS) under its Governance Project1 . The results are based on the pilot test of the


               Index  in  twelve  cities  and  municipalities  in  Bulacan  and  Davao  del  Norte  in  2001.  In

               summary, the GOFORDEV Index offers some suggestions to improve the quality of local


               governance, is found not unduly biased by any of its component indicators, and also generally

               consistent with a few similar indicators. The rest of the paper is arranged as follows: The


               conceptual framework behind the GOFORDEV Index is described in Section 2, followed by

               a discussion in Section 3 of the methodology used in evaluating the Index. The results are

               presented in Section 4. Concluding remarks end the paper.

                         In  international  development  as  noted  at  the  Wikipedia,  good  governance  is  a


               subjective  term  that  describes  how  public  institutions  conduct  public  affairs  and  manage

               public resources in the preferred way. Governance is the process of decision – making and


               the process by which decisions are implemented or not. The term governance can apply to

               corporate,  international,  national,  local  governance  or  to  the  interactions  between  other


               sectors in the society. (1)  "What is Good Governance". UNESCAP, 2009. Accessed July 10,

               emerges  as  a  model  to  compare  ineffective  economies  or  political  bodies  with  viable


               economies and political bodies. The concept centers on the responsibility of governments and

               governing bodies to meet  the needs of the masses as opposed to select groups in    society.

               at Google Books , good governance standards often measure other state institutions against

               these states. Aid organizations and the authorities of developed countries often will focus the

                         The research is  about  the assessment of the managerial  and leadership  skill  and the


               ethical  climate  of  the  chief  executives  and  senior  managers  in  Santa  Maria,  Bulacan,

               Philippines. Graft and corruption and other unethical practices are rampant in the Philippines,

               affecting the effective delivery of public service to the people even with the introduction of


               reforms in the government, and the existence of the laws and different policies. It is at this

               point  that  change  in  public  administration  must  lean  towards  reformation  of  people  in


               government service. The focus of this study was the local government units, because they are

               the front liners in the delivery of goods and services to the public. With devolved powers


               from  the  national  government,  the  local  government  officers  specifically  chief  executives

               such  as  mayor  and  barangay  chairmen,  together  with  senior  managers  of  their  respective


               units,  are  expected  to  work  in  an  ethical  climate,  to  manage  their  work,  people,  and

                         Findings of the study present a favorable picture of local governance and community


               development  in  the  sample  barangays  [villages].  Levels  of  efficiency  and  effectiveness  in

               revenue  collection  and  utilization  are  seen  to  be  "high".  The  level  of  satisfaction  with


               barangay  services  and  facilities,  as  well  as  services  and  projects  from  civil  society

               organizations (CSOs) are also  rated as  "high".  Managerial  efficiency  and effectiveness,  as


               well as leadership performance of the Punong Barangay [head of the village] are perceived

               positively.  Effectiveness  of  efforts  to  meet  basic  needs  and  satisfaction  of  such  needs  are


               assessed as "moderate", and there is the active participation of civil society in environmental

               protection efforts in the barangay. However, findings also bring to light the need for greater

               civil society participation in decision-making and development activities in the barangay, and


               for  the  Punong  Barangay  to  exercise  greater  political  will  in  the  performance  of  his/her

               official  responsibilities.  Findings  also  reveal  that  local  governance  is  positively  correlated


               with  community  development.  The  factors  of  local  governance,  i.e.  revenue  management,

               service delivery, and accountability contribute to community development specifically, the


               satisfaction of basic community needs and the protection and enhancement of environmental

               resources in the barangay. Furthermore, there is no significant difference in the operations of


               local  governance  and  community  development  across  different  income  levels  of  the

               barangay.  However,  the  protection  and  enhancement  of  environmental  resources  in  the


               barangay are higher in middle income barangay compared to the lower income barangays.

               The  study  recommends  a  systematic  and  comprehensive  human  resource  development

               program  to  provide  orientation  on  the  opportunities  and  prospects  for  good  governance

                       This study is focus on the assessment of Good Governance and Social Responsibility

               of Barangay Officials to their Community here in the Philippines.


                       According to  LGU or Local Government Unit, the  Barangay serves as the primary


               planning  and  implementing  unit  of  government  policies,  plans,  programs,  projects,  and

               activities in the community, and as a forum wherein the collective views of the people may


               be expressed, crystallized and considered, and where disputes may be amicably settled. This

               is made possible through different committees, councils or boards, or simply, mechanisms


               that create a multisectoral relationship with the people.






               Primary Planning


                       Planning is linked with budgeting as the plan, like in all other “planned” areas of our


               lives, sets the priority areas of services (in this case the barangays) and specifies the target

               outputs  and  accomplishments.  A  Barangay  Development  Plan  is  a  3-year  comprehensive

               multi-sectoral development plan that is put together through an inclusive and participatory


               approach headed by its development council and approved by its sanggunian (Morato, 2020).


                       Barangay Development  Plan constitutes the community action plan which provides


               the details on the plan. It includes the objectives and their related activities, and indicates the

               responsible  person,  the  schedule  or  target  time  frame,  expected  outputs  and  resource


               requirements. It also includes the Implementing |monitoring and evaluation plan


                        The Development Budgeting is a fund distribution on a long, medium and short term

               basis in order to support, implement and accomplished any proposed Barangay projects.]]></page><page Index="100"><![CDATA[Implementing Unit of Government



               Powers, Duties, and Functions


                       Barangay  officials  are  significant  to  the  development  of  the  nation.  It  passes

               ordinances, and resolutions for the effective administration of the barangay by LGC of 1991


               (Marino, 2015).


                       Punong Barangay is empowered to enforce all laws and ordinances; maintain public


               order; ensure the delivery of basic services; enforce laws and regulations relating to pollution

               control  and  protection  of  the  environment;  adopt  measures  to  prevent  and  control  the


               proliferation  of  squatters;  and  adopt  measures  to  prevent  and  eradicate  drug  abuse,  child

               abuse, and juvenile delinquency. The Sangguniang Barangay can enact ordinances; levy taxes


               and other revenue measures; provide for construction and maintenance of barangay facilities

               and  other  public  works;  regulate  use  of  public  facilities,  including  waterworks;  etc


               (Punongbayan, 2018).


                       Furthermore,  According  to  Davao  (2020),  barangay  officials  serve  as  a  bridge  in

               bringing  government  services  to  the  people  by  implementing  government  programs  and


               initiatives at the grassroots level. They must do this with the utmost integrity.  They must

               realize that being an elected barangay official is not merely a title they can hold on to. It is


               not simply a seat of influence. Being an official of the barangay means you are a frontline

               worker of the government in serving the people. Stop the politics. Stop the shenanigans. Start


               serving the community that voted for you.


                       In environmental protection, Barangays are the front liners in the delivery of essential

               services to their constituents (Ramos, 2018).



                       The vital role of the barangay in nation building. During the Spanish period in the

               Philippines,  the  barangay  was  headed  by  the  cabeza  de  barangay  (barangay  chief)  who]]></page><page Index="101"><![CDATA[formed part of the elite ruling class of the municipalities. The primary job of the cabeza de

               barangay then was to collect taxes (called tribute) from the residents. During the American


               regime,  the  barangay  became  the  barrio  until  President  Ferdinand  Marcos  ordered  the

               renaming of barrios back to barangays. The cabeza de barangay became the punong barangay


               or the barangay captain. Making the barangay the smallest unit of government in Philippine

               politics. Political parties take advantage of the power of the barangay because of its strong


               influence on the grassroots level (De Guzman, 2010).


               Activities in the Community



                       According  to  the  one  of  the  barangay  in  Davao,  their  activities  during  barangay

               celebration are Blood Letting, Mangrove Planting, Clean-Up Drive, Kapamilya Ng Barangay


               Night, DepEp Night, Pre-Schoolers Day, FUN RUN, Hataw Exercises that usually conducted

               within a week.



                       Furthermore,  According  to  FCED,  their  programs  envision  not  only  to  meet  the

               various needs of the street and urban poor children/youth and families in the community, but

               also to find an enduring solution to the pressing problem of poverty. The project highlights


               community  organization  as  a  strategy  for  implementation  as  it  hopes  to  facilitate  the

               organization  of  community  groups  and  local  councils  for  the  welfare  of  children  in  areas


               where they live. As well as its members; and in establishing a more sustainable living through

               the following programs and services: Community Organization; Children and Youth Groups,


               Parents’  Organizations,  Barangay  Council  for  the  Protection  of  Children  (BCPC),

               Microfinance,  Self-Help  Groups,  Livelihood/Microfinance,  Health  Services,  Educational

               center (Ramos, 2018).”


                       When it comes to the drug war, Barangay officials have the power to decide the shape


               of the war on drugs — they have the choice to go along with death, to submit to authority, or

               to adapt and resist (Villalon, Pangilinan, Fernandez, 2018).
