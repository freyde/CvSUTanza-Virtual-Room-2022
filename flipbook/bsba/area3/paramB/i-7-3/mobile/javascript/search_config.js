                  Ube La Confiture principal crop is ube, also known as dioscorea alata. Purple yam,                         violet yam, and water yam are all names for Dioscorea Alata, a yam species. This tuberous                         root  vegetable  is  native  to  Southeast  Asia,  notably  the  Philippines,  and  is  frequently                         mistaken for taro root. Purple yams have greyish-brown skins and purple flesh, and when                         cooked, their texture softens like that of a potato. They have a sweet, nutty flavor and can                          be used in a range of sweet and savory meals.                         Business management students came up with the idea for Ube La Confiture. Ayn, Jessica,                         Mitch,  Diane,  and  Melanie,  who  aspired  to  lead  a  revolution  of  socially  responsible                         businesses,a 100 percent natural product. For many entrepreneurs, especially new ones,                         starting their own business can be dangerous. Risk is the uncertainty of profit or loss, but                         as an entrepreneur, you must be confident enough to take the risks that come with running                         a firm. However, based on research and execution, sufficient capital and market research                          should be the first things that an entrepreneur learns because it is the key prerequisite in                         beginning  a  business  because  it  acts  as  the  business's  core  and  complete  source  of                         income.                         Many companies that sell pure organic products compete with Ube la confiture's large                         selection  of  domestic  and  foreign  competitors.  As  a  result,  it  competes  with  foreign                          competitors by selling natural and healthy products that are guaranteed tested and safe                         and do not include dangerous chemicals.

B.  Economic and Currency                                France’s economy is the fifth-largest in the world and represents approximately                         one-fifth of the Euro area gross domestic product (GDP). Currently, services are the main                         contributor to the country’s economy, with more than 70% of GDP coming from this sector.                         In manufacturing, France is one of the global leaders in the automotive, aerospace, and                                                                                                              9","railway sectors as well as in cosmetics and luxury goods.

Social and Cultural Factors                                France is one of the most modern countries in the world. It has a total population                         of 63.3 million as well as life expectancy for men is 78 years and 85 years for women.

Additionally,                         French which is the language of France is considered the second most widely learned                         foreign language in the world. Even though French citizens live by high standards, there                         are still social challenges. It is common in France to see high levels of unemployment and                         industrial strikes, demonstrations, and labor unrest. As well as anti-immigration sentiment                         is prevalent in some areas of French society.                                 D.  Technological Factors and Infrastructure                                France  is  one  of  the  most  developed  countries  in  the  world.  Where  it  has  an                         impressive  history  in  the  fields  of  science,  IT,  and  space  technology.  In  particular,  it                         launched  its  first  satellite  more  than  50  years  ago.  Overall,  France  became  the  third                         country to launch its satellite, and the sixth country to have a satellite in orbit after the                          former Soviet Union, USA, Canada, UK, and Italy. Furthermore, due to being one of the                         most modern countries in the world, the rate of Internet usage in France is very good.                         Hence some of the country’s related challenges are the shortage of computer engineers.                                E.  Legal and Regulatory                                                                                                                10","Some  aspects  of  employment  laws  in  France  are  that  the  legal  length  of  the                         working week is 35 hours in all types of companies. Also, employees cannot work more                         than  4.5  hours  without  a  break.  French  employment  law  has  provisions  for  employee                         overtime, annual leave, sick leave, maternity leave, paternity leave, sabbatical leave, etc.                          III. Economic Factors                            A.  Size of Market                                France is one of the leading trading countries and has grown to become one of the                         top exporting countries in the world with the value of exports representing more than one-                         fifth  of  GDP.  Moreover,  France  is  also  a  major  importer,  especially  in  machinery,                          chemicals, other chemical products, tropical agricultural products, and traditional industrial                         products such as clothing and textiles. Furthermore, more than three-fifths of France’s                         exports  and  imports  are  reserved  for  European  Union  (EU)  countries,  specifically                         Germany. Outside the EU, the United States is another major trading partner of France.                         EU countries are an important source of industrial imports to France, while fuel products                         and raw materials are likely to come from more distant sources. Meanwhile, agricultural                         and food exports are more focused on European markets, while industrial products are                          exported to a more global market.                            B.  National Income                                France had an annual gross domestic product of nearly $ 2.7 trillion, making it the                         fifth-largest economy in the world. That is why France’s total national income reached a                         record high of EUR637138.00 million in September of 2021. Also, France has an active                          presence in international trade and it is the second-largest trading country in Europe, after                         Germany.                            C.  Purchasing Power                                The purchasing power of households is the main issue in France. For the first time                         since 1989, inflation is expected to rise to the 3% threshold for most of the year 2022.                                                                                                             11","Also,  aggregate  household  income  is  growing  at  a  dynamic  pace  consistent  with  the                         impact of inflation. Job creation boosted the total disposable income of households in                         France. Meanwhile, households have different situations, especially for non -discretionary                         spending (increases in rent and energy) which will result in reductions in their income.                          Furthermore,  there  are  advantages  of  purchasing  power  in  the  long  run  that  can  be                         compared through the structural dynamics of inflation and wages. Wherein, inflation has                         fallen on the purchasing power of low-income households due to declining wage growth.                            D.  Availability of Credit                                According to the French Property real estate service. France has no major credit                          reporting  agency.  Instead,  to  pursue  a  mortgage,  it  needs  three  months  of  bank                         statements and paperwork to prove income as well as proof of marital status (if applicable)                         and the contract of sale. Moreover, the bank will dig into the financial records, It will also                         require at least 15% down payment and fees with an additional 7%.                         IV. Type of Economy                                France's economic system is mixed, including various private freedom combined                         with centralized economic planning and government regulation. In particular, the economy                          of France is highly developed and has a free-market-oriented business model. Moreover,                         the economy of France is the fifth-largest in the world and represents approximately one-                         fifth of the Euro area gross domestic product (GDP). Nowadays, services are the main                         contributor to the country’s economy, with more than 70% of GDP coming from this sector.                         In manufacturing, France is one of the global leaders in the automotive, aerospace, and                          railway sectors as well as in cosmetics and luxury goods. Furthermore, France has a                         highly educated labor force and the highest number of science graduates per thousand                         workers in Europe.                         I. Cultural Background                            A.  National Culture                                                                                                             12","a.  Identity                                              French national identity is founded on the country's historical roots                                       in  Celtic,  Gallo-Roman,  and  Frankish  civilizations.  Originally,  the  term                                       \"France\"  referred  to  many  peoples  in  the  lower  Rhineland.  After  the                                        Frankish  invasion  and  the  Roman  retreat,  it  eventually  became  a  more                                       prevalent phrase to represent the region previously known as Gaul. Until                                       the Middle Ages, the word \"Francia\" was used to numerous geographical                                       divisions  before  coming  to  denote  the  kingdom  of  the  French  ruler.                                       Provencal and Breton’s identities have coexisted with political units under                                        governmental  rule.  Furthermore,  France  is  a  unitary  semi-presidential                                       republic. Meanwhile, Paris, the largest city in France, is the primary cultural                                       and commercial center and serves as the nation's capital. The other major                                       urban areas in France include Marseille, Lyon, Toulouse, Lille, Bordeaux,                                       and Nice.                                   b.  Material Life                                              The museums in France have garnered a lot of praise and are home                                        to many well-known works of art. But the cuisine of France is the very last                                       item  that  exemplifies  the  country's  material  culture.  The  French  are                                       renowned worldwide for their bread, cheeses, and other delicacies that are                                       eaten for breakfast, such as baguettes and croissants.                                   c.  Language                                               The  French  language,  sometimes  known  as  French  francais,  is                                       most likely the most influential Romance language on an international level                                       globally. Aside from that, 96 percent of the population in France speaks in                                       their mother tongue. Meanwhile, the remaining four percent talk in a foreign                                       language like English, Spanish, German, Italian, Arabic, or Portuguese.                                                                                                             13","d.  Social Interactions                                              How a person communicates in French is often affected by their                                       age,  degree  of  education,  social  standing,  age,  and  the  nation's  region                                       where they were raised. The manner of delivery and the selection of words                                        will change depending on these criteria. The majority of the time, they will                                       talk in French, although some may also utilize the dialect of their location.                                   e.  Aesthetics                                              From history to people, clothing to traditions, women to beliefs, and                                       dressing,  France's  culture  reveals  sophisticated  aesthetic  sensibilities.                                        France  has  a  thriving  luxury  industry,  including  Louis  Vuitton,  Hermès,                                       Cartier, and Christian Louboutin. There are several classic French names                                       linked with the country's luxury goods. This preference for excellent quality                                       can be seen in the fashion business, where Lanvin, Dior, Chanel, Christian                                       Lacroix, Pierre Cardin, Saint Laurent, and Paco Rabanne are among the                                       most prestigious French fashion brands. These brands, however, would be                                       meaningless without French women and their image as the embodiment of                                        freedom and grace. Furthermore, fine food is an essential aspect of the                                       French way of life.                                   f.  Religion                                              France has a solid secular heritage and has not gathered official                                       statistics  on  religious  affiliation  since  the  1972  national  census.  In  turn,                                        addressing the religious composition of French society may be rather tricky.                                       Around 63-66 percent of the population is Catholic, 7-9 percent are Muslim,                                       0.5-0.75  percent  are  Jewish,  0.5-0.75  percent  are  Buddhist,  and  0.5-1                                       percent are affiliated with another religion, and an additional 23-28 percent                                       of the population is thought to be religiously unaffiliated.                                                                                                             14","g.  Education                                              French people place a high priority on formal education, certificates,                                       and  intellectualism.  According  to  law,  education  is  required  in  France                                       beginning at six. However, most children start school at the age of three.                                        Schooling should last until sixteen and should be both secular and free.                                       The objective is to democratize information access so that every kid obtains                                       an equal education.                                   h.  Value Systems                                              The French national motto “Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity” reflects                                        the core values of French society. Equality and unity are important to the                                       French. Liberté, Egalité, Fraternité'are often identified as essential to what                                       it means to be 'French'. Moreover, ‘Liberté, Egalité, Fraternité’ (‘Liberty,                                       Equality, Fraternity’) are often identified as essential to what it means to be                                       ‘French’. Also, the values of equality and fraternity indicate that the French                                       are  a  unified  and  undivided  group.  On  a  personal  level,  many  people                                       continue to revise what it means to be French, especially in light of the                                        growth  of  the  EU  and  the  influx  of  immigrants.  However,  there  is  a                                       prevailing  attitude  that  France  ought  to  be  the  home  of  the  indivisible                                       ‘peuple  français’  (‘French  people’).  In  other  words,  the  government                                       prohibits  state  authorities  from  collecting  data  regarding  personal                                       information to avoid ethnic and religious markers highlighting differences                                        within France.                            B.  Business Culture                                       The French are not fond of confrontation or high-pressure sales methods.                                They  are  more  open  to  a  low-key,  logical  presentation  that  fully  outlines  the                                benefits of a proposition. The French are known for scrutinizing every element of                                                                                                             15","a  proposal.  The  French  may  discuss  and  raise  questions  about  the  goal  of                                negotiation  using  a  more  formal,  logical  strategy.  When  an  agreement  is                                established,  the  French  partner  may  insist  on  formalizing  it  in  an  exceedingly                                detailed, carefully drafted contract. Allow enough time for the deal to be finalized.                             C.  Organizational Culture                                        The French corporate culture specifies a certain code or logic of honor, with                                 a clear distinction between management and lower levels of workers, each with its                                own  set  of  rights  and  obligations.  The  French  management  culture  is  strongly                                implicit in terms of communication style, rationality in task mastery is very oriented                                toward  people,  problem-solving  strategy  is  oriented  toward  a  creative  and                                individual  way  of  thinking,  time  management  is  polychrone,  and  power  and                                influence structures are externalized and concentrated at the top of the hierarchy,                                and  decision  processes  are  strongly  dissent  oriented.  These characteristics,  in                                 particular, define first and foremost the interaction of the businesses' personnel                                with  one  another,  but  they  are  also  important  for  intercultural  dialogue.                                Furthermore,  they  impact  internal  processes,  communication  channels,  and                                activities inside the organization, which is regarded as less formal and schematized                                in  France  than  in  Anglo-American  or  German  corporations.  Furthermore,  the                                 government's substantial influence and the ensuing close relationship between the                                state and French firms are recurring features of the French economic model.

The design of the glass jar, the lid, and the scents all                                help to uncover past handcrafted values. The product's lid is covered with gold                                plated and with addition spoon on a side, which serves as the brand's identity and                                 distinguishes it from other products on the shelves.                                    B. Price                                       The market for jam and ube workshop items is highly unpredictable, with                                fierce  competition.  The  formats  are  continually  changing,  leaving  consumers                                perplexed and unsure of what to choose. The Ube La Confiture brand, on the other                                 hand,  is  generally found  at  the top  of the  line. The top  of the  range  is  divided                                between organic items, which are becoming increasingly visible on the shelves                                and represent the current trend, and products such as Ube La Confiture, which are                                already well-known and thus constitute a safe bet. The brand cannot increase the                                price of its products in order to avoid the possibility of competition interfering and                                the brand becoming the most popular. Ube has a good reputation, which helps it                                to keep its market leadership and, more importantly, stay within the same pricing                                 ranges.                                     C. Promotion                                         Brand marketing strategies have evolved significantly over time, but they                                have  unquestionably  been  modernized.

The  brand's  packaging  makes  a  big                                impression on the shelves and is instantly recognizable. As a result, they expect it                                to be nearly, dare we say, required on store shelves.

Political and Legal Background                                         France is a democratically run country. The President of the Republic, who                                is elected by direct universal suffrage, is the country's leader. France's government                                and  political  system,  which  dates  back  to  1789  and  includes  modern  political                                institutions, is one of the birthplaces of modern democracy. The current French                                government is governed by the Fifth Republic Constitution, which was ratified in                                 1958.  France  is  both  a  republic  and  a  parliamentary  democracy,  with  a                                presidential/parliamentary system. The French President is the head of state, and                                the Prime Minister is the head of government.                                        Bicameral  government  exists  in  France.  The  National  Assembly                                 (Assemblée  Nationale),  which  sits  in  the  Palais  Bourbon  and  has  577  elected                                                                                                             18","members, is the lower chamber. The Senate (Sénat), which is housed within the                                Luxembourg  Palace,  is  the  upper  chamber.  It  has  348  senators  elected  by  a                                representative  electoral  college.  Since  1958,  the  Senate  has  been  politically                                conservative,  with  a  right-wing  majority  in  all  but  three  years.  The  National                                 Assembly is the more powerful of the two chambers, despite their identical powers.                                 A. Home Country vs. Host Country (Relationship)                                         Despite a lengthy history of democratic administration and genuine efforts                                at market-oriented economic reform, poverty, corruption, crime, and insurgency                                continue  to  afflict  the  Philippines.  This  stagnation  is  exacerbated  by  the  ruling                                class's  long-standing  exemption  from  the  rule  of  law,  which  has  kept  the                                 unresponsive and inefficient ruling elite out of electoral and economic competition                                that may drive substantial reform. The Philippines' incapacity to bring the ruling                                class under the rule of law is a continuous roadblock to progress that can only be                                overcome by sustained political pressure from the Filipino people.

We  have  French                                connections in our Philippine history, education, and quest for economic progress                                 all  have  French  roots.  Unknown  to  many,  a  Frenchman  in  the  early  1820s                                established what could be the Philippines' first modern farm.                                  B. Structure of Government                                                                                                                   19","The Prime Minister, who is the head of government, is joined by senior and                                junior  ministers  in  the  French  government.  The  Council  of  Ministers,  the                                government's main executive organ, was established in 1958 by the Constitution.                                Its members meet in the Élysée Palace in Paris once a week. The sessions are                                 chaired  by  the  President  of  France,  the  country's  head  of  state,  who  is  not  a                                member  of  the  Government.  The  government  leads  and  decides  the  nation's                                policy,  according  to  the  French  Fifth  Republic's  Constitution.  In  reality,  the                                government  drafts  laws  to  be  introduced  in  parliament,  as  well  as  writes  and                                publishes  decrees.  All  government  political  decisions  must  be  recorded  in  the                                 government register.                                 C. Government Policies and Regulations                                         France has undergone significant transformation in recent decades. Many                                former  rural  areas  have  been  transformed  by  rapid  urbanization  and                                suburbanization.  Simultaneously,  many  metropolitan  cities  have  confronted  an                                increasing  need  for  reconstruction  and rehabilitation,  often  in the face of rising                                crime rates. Northern France's once-dominant industrial districts have seen their                                conventional manufacturing base erode and economies reorganized. Conversely,                                 previously underdeveloped areas of western and southern France have become                                hotbeds  for  new  manufacturing  and  service  operations,  particularly  in  high                                technology. These are also becoming increasingly appealing places to live, work,                                and vacation. The constitution of 1958 created a mixed (semipresidential) form of                                governance,  combining  aspects  of  both  the  parliamentary  and  presidential                                systems, in order to attain the political stability that was lacking in the Third and                                Fourth Republics. As a result, the parliament is divided into two chambers: The                                 National Assembly (lower house) and the Senate (upper house). The president is                                                                                                             20","elected by direct universal suffrage and serves as the country's chief executive.                                The president has the right to designate the prime minister (also known as the                                premier), who is in charge of enforcing legislation. The president of the republic                                has a significant role in the French system. The president's office is unique in that                                 it has the power to circumvent parliament by submitting referendums to the people                                directly and even to abolish parliament entirely. The president chairs the Council                                of Ministers and other high councils, signs the most significant decrees, appoints                                top civil servants and judges, negotiates and ratifies treaties, and leads the armed                                forces.

INTERNATIONAL MARKETING PLAN                          I. Situational Analyses                                Ube La Confiture principal crop is ube, also known as dioscorea alata. Purple yam,                         violet yam, and water yam are all names for Dioscorea Alata, a yam species. This tuberous                         root  vegetable  is  native  to  Southeast  Asia,  notably  the  Philippines,  and  is  frequently                         mistaken for taro root. Purple yams have greyish-brown skins and purple flesh, and when                         cooked, their texture softens like that of a potato. They have a sweet, nutty flavor and can                         be used in a range of sweet and savory meals. Taro root (Colocasia esculenta), on the                          other hand, is a sweeter root vegetable. Taro is a tropical taro plant that is not one of the                         over  600  yam  varieties.  Due  to  its  great  demand  in  the  food  processing  sector  and                         medicinal properties, this purple type of yam is now the most costly and essential root crop                         in  the  Philippines.  Seasonal  production,  overproduction,  and  the  rejection  of  farmers'                         harvests that could not be readily absorbed by the existing market plague the purple yam                          industry value chain, as do issues with the availability of quality planting materials and                         farmers' awareness of tissue culture yam plantlet care and management.

For  many  entrepreneurs,                         especially new ones, starting their own business can be dangerous. Risk is the uncertainty                          of profit or loss, but as an entrepreneur, you must be confident enough to take the risks                         that  come  with  running  a  firm.  However,  based  on  research  and  execution,  sufficient                         capital and market research should be the first things that an entrepreneur learns because                         it is the key prerequisite in beginning a business because it acts as the business's core                         and complete source of income.

Whereas French culture is also known for its elegance and style, as                         evidenced by its dresses or suits, other arts, and taste in premium foods, international                        companies  involved  in  food  processing  should  consider  offering  their  products  in  the                         country.                               International companies, on the other hand, may be concerned about complying                        with  French  law  and  regulations,  distribution  channels  or  industry  norms,  a  high                         concentration of domestic competitors, and France's distinct business culture.                               Furthermore, thanks to the internet, promotion and meeting customer expectations                         are now easier than ever in France.                               Furthermore,  global  payment  gateways  and  mobile  payment  solutions  make  it                        simple to receive funds in different currencies.                                While  France  has  a  well-established  domestic  market  in  many  sectors,  the                        country's pride in beauty and artistry, as well as high food standards, drives consumers to                        seek out other products and services that offer unique sweets to add to their menus or as                         a common way to consume foods.                               Furthermore,  France's  business  culture  is  not  as  difficult  as  many  companies                        believe.  Patience,  integrity, respect,  knowledge of  business  customs,  and  a  long-term                         approach to business success are the main ingredients for success in France.                                                                                                                                      36","REFERENCES                         GOV.

Product Concept                      The word “meatloaf” may sound very non-Filipino. Well, in the first place, the word is                  obviously  not  Filipino.  And  perhaps  the  dish  is  not  a  Filipino  original,  either.  But  Filipinos                 always finds a way of adopting anything foreign that we like If not that, the Filipinos may just                 have our own version of something and does not have to copy from foreigners. Whichever is                 the case, there is a Filipino version of the meatloaf – the Embutido.                      Embutido, or embotido, is a Philippine meatloaf made with ground pork and stuffed with                  hard-boiled eggs and sliced ham or various sausages. It is traditionally wrapped in aluminum                 foil and steamed, though it can also be baked. Much like lumpia, Embutido is a popular dish                 prepared and enjoyed at Filipino gatherings and other special occasions. It can be served hot                 or chilled,  and  is  usually  dipped  in  banana ketchup  or some  other type  of  dipping  sauce.                 Embutido is a staple Filipino dish for the holidays. But many homes do not limit their enjoyment                 of the embutido to a holiday. The dish maybe prepared in volume and stored in the refrigerator                 to last for several days or weeks. Then it may be enjoyed every day or anytime during the day                  while it lasts.                       Many Filipino families have their own heirloom embutido recipes. Which may be taken to                 mean that the dish has been around in the country for quite a while already – “a while” meaning                 several generations. Yes, different embutido recipes would have their own twist to the dish.                 Embutido may be served fresh from the fridge or fresh from the frying pan. And while embutido                 is basically meatloaf, when the dish is called embutido the suggestion is that it’s homemade.                 Meatloaf is mainly understood as the commercial type found in supermarkets while embutido                 is the type that is especially made at home.                       As of our own version, we further developed the popularly known Filipino dish, Embutido                 into Tinapa-embutido or smoked-fish embutido. It is a fish counterpart and took inspiration                 of the iconic Filipino meatloaf, which is the Embutido. It uses the equally iconic 'Tinapa' known","as 'smoked-fish', which is abundant especially in the southern province of Cavite, specifically,                 at the coastal town of Tanza. The origin of using Fish in exchange of other proteins such as                 chicken or pork meat in the traditional embutido, can be traced when Spain colonized the                 Philippines for three and a half centuries beginning in the middle of the 15th century. During                  that time, the Spaniards introduced different recipes. In other words, “Embutido” belongs to a                 category of sausage recipes during the Spanish colonial period. Like most Filipino dishes in                 Philippine culinary history, Embutido has evolved over the passage of time from its Spanish                 origin.  Embutido  was  developed  by  Filipinos  to  suit  their  own  taste  and  liking,  hence  the                 development of 'Tinapa-embutido' also now known as Tinudopa.                    II.  Market Size                      The  love  of  meat  products  by  local  consumers  in  the  Philippines  saw  a  rise  in  meat                 consumption, most specifically for pork meat. By 2021, it was forecasted that pork would be                 the most consumed type of meat in the Philippines at approximately 15 kilograms per person                 per annum. The leading meat products consumed in the country are chicken and pork based.                 In 2020, the pork consumption per capita in the Philippines was about 14.9 kilograms per                  person,  while  13.74  kilograms  of  poultry  meat  per  capita  were  consumed  per  person.  In                 situations where animal feeds are at a shortage due to adverse weather conditions, or rising                 fuel prices halt the deliveries of meat, ripple effects are manifested mainly in pricing. In this                 case,  consumer's  interest  in  purchasing  meat  steers  the  increasing  domestic  price  of  the                 market.                       Filipino consumers shop almost daily on a needs basis in wet and dry markets, which                 make up the largest distribution channel for fishing industry. With this being said, consumers                 now  look  for  alternatives  in  pork  or  chicken  meat,  which  are  Fish.  And  according  to  the                 Department of Agriculture (2021), Fish are now more affordable as supply stabilizes in Metro                 Manila, which also means, that the price of local-fresh marine fish commodities in the NCR                 has begun to stabilize. With the resumption of large supplies of fresh marine commodities in                 the market, consumers now have more affordable fish to choose from and put on their tables.","The abundance of supply now is perfectly in time with the country's urgent need to ramp up                 efforts to ensure the nation's food security as we battle an even stronger challenge of the                 covid-19 pandemic.                    III. Consumer Trends                      The  simplest  dishes  are  often  the  best,  and  proof  of  this  is  the  humble  embutido  or                 meatloaf. It’s practically just a log of minced meat peppered with whatever ingredients and                 techniques are available in the country it is adapted in.                      In South Africa, there’s bobotie, which is spiced with curry and topped with eggs, while in                  the Middle East, the meat, made typically with lamb, clings onto sticks as they are grilled.                 Indonesia has otak-otak where fish replaces beef, and, instead of being baked, is wrapped in                 banana leaves then kissed by hot charcoal. Another technique used is steaming, like on the                 Chinese zheng rou bing, which is composed of pork and scallions. There are many other                 variations:  Vietnam  has gio,  Bulgaria  has rulo  Stefani,  Chile  has  asado aleman, Italy  has                 polpettone, and our country has embutido, the egg-embedded, raisin-speckled meatloaf of our                 youth.                        Not everyone's a fan of embutido partly because it is a mix of ground pork, hotdog, boiled                 eggs, relish, raisins etc. and then people can eat cold which makes it pretty unsettling. But                 still, there are those who love the dish enough that it remains a staple at all special occasions                 and gatherings. Therefore, Filipinos have come up with different versions of it to eat during                 holidays or on daily basis as 'ulam'. In our case, we use Tinapa or Smoked Fish in exchange                 of pork meat, making it an even affordable dish.                       There is currently little to no direct competition for and Tinapa Embutido as it is neither                  popular nor well-known in the market. Not only it has a different approach on how Tinapa was                 usually served, but also it is an affordable alternative in the kitchen instead of using chicken                 or pork meat on Embutido. This gives our product a unique and distinct competitive advantage                 as well as the fact that it is easy to distinguish for the consumers, a fresh, and home-made","product that can be prepared just as simply as the store-bought brands or fried directly for the                 customers upon purchase.                       Believed to have been introduced during the American occupancy, the embutido is an                  underrated dish usually reserved for special occasions. But its simplicity begs regularity. Its                 level of difficulty is akin to a boxed mix: You toss everything into a bowl, make sure they’re                 well-combined, wrap in foil, and then steam.                       Best of all, it adjusts to your liking. Substitute chicken eggs for quail eggs for aesthetics,                 throw in chopped nuts for texture and slather on banana ketchup for a slightly sweet flavor—                 embutido, or any type of meatloaf for that matter, can be designed to suit your palate, and it’s                 for these reasons why it deserves prevalence and more credit than it is given.","SITUATIONAL ANALYSIS                   A.

Packaging                                             It was supposed to be in a Tupperware but was forgotten to capture so it is excluded                         in the photo. This happened because the courier is already at the given location to                         pick up the final product.                        B.
