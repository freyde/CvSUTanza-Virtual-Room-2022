    <pre style="white-space:pre-line"><code>complete number of faculty members. She then opened her concern about the deployment of their
                   students as practice teachers for face-to-face teaching. She asked if they can hold a face-to-face
                   demonstration teaching in the campus for them to assess their students’ readiness, knowledge,
                   and skills in actual teaching, before their deployment. This will be held for 3 days, with 42 Education
                   students and they plan to start the activity the following week. Prof. Ramos approved the request
                   and advised that they may not deploy the students who will not pass their assessment.
                          Ms. Fabian then reported about the recruitment of faculty members for the Department of
                   Arts and Sciences being completed. She also said that the Job Order faculty members especially
                   the newly hired should submit their requirements as soon as possible for their contracts.
                          In  line  with  the  preparation  of  the  opening  of  classes,  Prof.  Ramos  asked  the  faculty
                   members to follow the prescribed syllabus in their handled courses. He then asked Ms. Sebastian
                   about  any  updates  regarding  the  NBC.  Ms.  Sebastian  told  the  group  that  those  who  will  be
                   promoted to one to three steps are already certain of the reclassification while those who will be
                   promoted to at least four steps will still wait for BOR approval.
                          The meeting then proceeded to the next agenda which is the admission and enrolment.
                   Ms. Perida, the campus registrar, reported that there are 556 qualified first year students who
                   already confirmed their slots but only 369 of them submitted the necessary requirements. Prof.
                   Ramos then asked Ms. Perida to extend the deadline of requirements until September 16, 2022,
                   Friday. Ms. Perida then added that there are already 1200 old students enrolled. She also reported
                   that there are four students who requested transfer credentials to transfer to CvSU-Cavite City
                   campus but currently requesting to return to the campus because they were not able to secure
                   their slots in Cavite City. However, because their transfer credentials were already signed and
                   released, their request to return were not granted.
                          Prof. Ramos then opened the next agenda which is the campus designation. He told the
                   group that the campus needs reappointment of designations. First, he will be the department chair
                   of the Department of Arts and Sciences but Mr. Mark Joel Sibulo will help him perform his duties
                   as chair. Second, Ms. Sebastian will still be the research coordinator of the campus. He then told
                   the group to include the performance of their designations as one of their priorities. He announced
                   that Dr. Polinga already approved the designation of the staff to administrative positions.
                          He also announced that the campus will no longer have an official campus vehicle because
                   he already returned it to the main campus. Proceeding to the next agenda, he asked TED to get
                   an update about English Critic accreditation to have additional accredited English Critic in the
                   campus.
                          For the next agenda, he announced that it was already allowed to use textbooks and he
                   suggested  that  the  campus  sell  textbooks  as  an  income-generating  project.  Prof.  Ramos
                   recommended his books to be sold but reminded that the students should not be required to buy
                   the textbooks that the campus will sell.
                          Prof.  Ramos  shared  to  the  group  that  the  main  campus  will  be  having  an  extension
                   program in Brgy. Bagtas which is planting kaong. They plan to hold a transfer of technology to
                   Bagtas  residents,  specifically  the  production  of  vinegar  and  sugar  from  kaong.  Prof.  Ramos
                   suggested that the campus anchor its extension program to this activity of the main campus.
                   However, Ms. Villa, the extension program coordinator of the campus told the group that there is
                   already an approved campus extension program.
                          Other matters discussed during the meeting includes the request of Prof. Ramos to have
                   a copy of the raw data of the monthly attendance report of the faculty. He added that in line with
                   the  new  HR  Memo  on  work  arrangement,  the  faculty  members  will  continue  to  follow  their
                   alternative work arrangement schedule (two days WFH and two days campus reporting) while the
                   non-academic staff will be reporting to the campus four days a week. He then announced that Ms.
                   Fabian and Mr. Fred will be the liaison officers.
                          After this, Prof. Ramos shared some reminders for the opening of classes. He reminded
                   the group to be not too lenient to the students. With this, Ms. Sebastian shared that the TED will
                   be starting to require student attendance to class meetings.
                          The meeting adjourned at 2:54 PM.</code></pre>
