          I. DEFINITION OF CONSUMER BEHAVIOR

            Consumer behavior is a rapidly growing discipline of study. It means more than just how a person buys
        products. It is a complex and multidimensional process and reflects the totality of consumers’ decisions with

        respect  to  acquisition,  consumption  and  disposal  activities.  We,  as  consumers,  exhibit  very  significant
        differences in our buying behavior and play an important role in local, national or international economic

        conditions. One of the very few aspects common to all of us is that we are all consumers and the reason for
        a business firm to come into being is the presence of consumers who have unfulfilled, or partially fulfilled
        needs and wants. No matter who we are – urban or rural, male or female, young or old, rich or poor, educated

        or uneducated, believer or non-believer, or whatever – we are all consumers. We consume or use on a
        regular  basis food,  shelter,  clothing,  education, entertainment,  brooms,  toothbrushes,  vehicles,  domestic
        help, healthcare and other services, necessities, comforts, luxuries and even ideas etc. Organizations realize

        that their marketing effectiveness in satisfying consumer needs and wants at a profit depends on a deeper
        understanding  of  consumer  behavior.  Our  consumption  related  behavior  influences  the  development  of
        technology and introduction of new and improved products and services.




                                                                                                                1]]></page><page Index="5"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY

            To succeed in a dynamic marketing environment, marketers have an urgent need to learn and anticipate
        whatever  they  can  about  consumers.  The  better  they  know  and  understand  consumers,  the  more
        advantageous it would prove in accomplishing their organizational objectives. Marketers want to know what

        consumers think, what they want, how they work, how they entertain themselves, how they play etc. They
        also  need  to  comprehend  personal  and  group  influences  which  have  a  significant  impact  on  consumer
        decision-making process.


        “Consumer  behavior  refers  to  the  actions  and  decision  processes  of  people  who  purchase  goods  and
        services for personal consumption.”
                                                         James F Engel, Roger D Blackwell and Paul W Miniard,
                                                                  “Consumer Behavior” (Dryden Press, 1990)

        Consumer behavior refers to “the mental and emotional processes and the physical activities of people who
        purchase and use goods and services to satisfy particular needs and wants.”
                                                        Bearden et al. “Marketing Principles and Perspectives.”

        “The behavior that consumers display in searching for, purchasing, using, evaluating and disposing of, if
        products and services that they expect will satisfy their needs.”
                                             Leon G Schiffman and Leslie Lazar Kanuk, ‘Consumer Behavior’,
                                                                               Prentice-Hall of India, 4th ed. 1991

        Consumer behavior refers to “the mental and emotional processes and the observable behavior of consumers
        during searching, purchasing and post consumption of a product or service.”
                                                                                                         Authors


               How consumers make decisions to spend their available resources such as money, time and effort

        on consumption and use related items is the subject of consumer behavior study. Consumer behavior has
        two aspects: the final purchase activity which is visible to us and the decision process which may involve the
        interplay of a number of complex variables not visible to us. In fact, purchase behavior is the end result of a

        long process of consumer decision making. The study involves what consumers’ buy, why they buy it, how
        they buy it, when they buy it, where they buy it, how frequently they buy it and how they dispose of the product
        after use.



             II. IMPORTANCE OF CONSUMER BEHAVIOR


               There are three basic factors why Consumer Behavior is important. It is necessary to talk about each
        of  these  factors  before  starting  with  certain  basic  principles  associated  with  Consumer  Behavior.  It  is
        important  to  understand  the  impact  of  consumer  behavior  on  marketing  strategies  before  proceeding  to

        consumer behavior concepts.






                                                                                                                2]]></page><page Index="6"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY

               Consumer Behavior as the essence of marketing is synergized with the following directions. The three
        directions or factors are:
        1. The consumer mind itself acts as a direction;

        2. The environmental direction; and

        3. The organizational direction.

               These are the three factors that emphasize the importance of consumer  behavior to marketeers.
        Essentially, the context in which consumer behavior is applied could be different, but the underlying principles

        of Consumer Behavior are the same.
        Consumer Behavior as the Essence of Marketing
               The  first  factor  is  associated  with  consumer  behavior  as  the  essence  of  marketing.  This  factor

        elaborates on how consumer behavior tries to enhance and harness several other subjects associated with
        marketing.
               For example, if we consider retailing management, retailing in a shopping context can never happen

        without consumer behavior. This could be associated with the point of purchase aspects or the impulsivity
        aspects of consumer or the visual merchandising, which is done by a particular retailer; and there could be
        many other aspects as well. This holds good for mundane products which are shopped by the ordinary people

        as well as for luxury products, which are only within the reach of a few consumers or economically on a higher
        plane.

               Let us take the example of advertising management. Almost 50 years back, the concept of brand
        positioning was pioneered by stalwarts Ries and Trout. Brand positioning is associated with the unique image
        created by the offering in the mind of the consumer. When I say offering, it refers to a specific brand. How

        can a brand manager or a marketing manager get into brand positioning without having an idea of Consumer
        Behavior?
               Let us consider yet another aspect of marketing, which is customer relationship management or CRM.

        Essentially, customer relationship is based on the behavioral aspects of human beings. So, CRM is not about
        marketing,  it is not about branding, and it is very much about people. Without understanding Consumer
        Behavior, it is extremely difficult to strategize several aspects of CRM or customer relationship management.

        Let us take online retailing or digitalization. Consumer Behavior is important even for digitalization. Let us
        take the example of Amazon or Flipkart or any other online retailer. The online retailer today talks about Big

        Data, which is associated with analytics and which is associated with Data science. It is only Consumer
        Behavior  that  could  provide  valuable  insights  for  marketeers  of  online  retailing;  to  segment  markets,  to
        customize offering and to connect with consumers in real time.

               So, Consumer Behavior interface is extremely important to any aspect of marketing because it brings
        with it an experiential aspect associated with the experience of consumers which will otherwise be missing.





                                                                                                                3]]></page><page Index="7"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY

        The Consumer Mindset as Direction
               Why is consumer mindset a direction? This is because the central pillar which several of the other
        directions need to take cues from consumer mindset.

               Brand differentiation can be done on several ways. It can be done with respect to the functional
        attributes. It can be done with respect to the consumers emotions. It can be done with respect to several
        aspects that are concerned with the psychological nature of the consumers. It can be done with respect to

        consumer sense of belongingness to their groups or friends or families. It can be done with respect to the
        sensual or experiential pleasure experienced by the consumers. It can also be done with respect to a solution
        given by a brand, as in the case of painting a house that was initiated by a paint company like Asian Paints.

        There are several ways in which the consumer's mind can be approached by the marketeer. The fundamental
        point to be noted is that given a situation where functional attributes of a product are on an even keel with

        respect  to  other  products  in  the  same  category,  then  it  is  only  the  psychological  aspects  of  Consumer
        Behavior that can bring the kind of differentiation that makes a brand competitive.
               Let  us  discuss  some  examples  with  respect  to  soaps,  mobiles,  watches  and  apparel.  There  are

        several ways in which a brand can get itself differentiated. When we talk about brands which are there in the
        same price band, the differentiation on functional features is almost insignificant in several categories. Even

        if  the  differentiation  is  possibly  obtained  by  a  brand  with  respect  to  its  functional  features,  there  will  be
        competitors  who  are  following  suit.  Besides  the  psychological  aspects  of  differentiation  are  significant
        because  there  is  a  likelihood  of  the  consumer  forming  a  relationship  with  the  brand  just  as  we  form

        relationships with other people.
               Let us take the case of a well-known brand which was launched possibly during the mid-eighties. The
        name is HeroHonda, and the brand differentiation was simple - “Fill it, shut it, forget it”. This proposition

        conveyed  the  effectiveness  of  petrol  consumption  with  respect  to  motorcycle  category.  The  brand  was
        launched at a time where most of the brands were giving almost half the kind of mileage associated with
        HeroHonda. HeroHonda had launched a brand on the functional proposition. The advertising and positioning

        of a brand had created an attitude that ensured that the brand was highly successful. This is an example of
        a brand that created a functional proposition and succeeded.

               In contrast to the Hero Honda, let us consider the positioning of Red Bull. Red Bull is an energy drink
        which is oriented towards young target segment. Red Bull, of course, has more caffeine and it keeps the
        consumer awake, but essentially, the proposition of Red Bull is its association with energy and parties that

        youngsters  indulge  in.  Hence  in  terms  of  functional  proposition,  it  is  subjugated  to  the  psychological
        proposition of belongingness as associated with youngsters and parties and so on. Red Bull symbolizes the

        party going fun related to youngsters, and party going is the in thing with respect to young groups.
               Consumer  Behavior  as  a  direction  taking  into  account  the  mindset  of  the  consumer  also  has  to
        connect with the lifestyles of consumers. Let us take a look at the Indian environment when we consider a

        product like Quaker Oats- it is in line with the lifestyle focusing on fitness and health. It is be noted that food
        is an innate part of the culture, and it is extremely difficult to change the habits of consumers with respect to

                                                                                                                4]]></page><page Index="8"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                     Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus

        food habits in any part of the world. Today, with the culture of fitness and health getting into the awareness
        of urban consumers. Quaker Oats is slowly becoming a routine with respect to the breakfast of several
        consumers in the urban cities.

               Let us take the example of lifestyle connected with online shopping with respect to apparel. Myntra is
        a brand that has made use of the current fashion of online shopping and the concept of one's apparel as a
        reflection  of  once  self  which  is  associated  with  personality.  So,  personalities  another  aspect  of  the

        psychological dimension associated with Consumer Behavior.
               There are several kinds of brands that get associated with the lifestyles of consumers. Nescafe is an
        instant coffee that is into the lifestyle of urban consumers. It is just not positioned on the convenience of

        making coffee. It is positioned on the psychological aspects of making enjoyable moments more enjoyable
        with a cup of Nescafe.

               Consumer Behavior as a mindset also connects with rituals in the consumer's mind. The ritual in
        simple terms is a routine activity of a consumer which is repeated in a fixed sequence over a period of time.
        The purpose of the ritual can either be symbolic or functional. Functional could be with respect to hunger,

        and the symbolic aspect of ritual could be with respect to celebrations.
               Let us take the case of coconut oil. Coconut oil is something that has been used for the ritual of

        grooming hair for the last several decades. Parachute is a brand that has converted the opportunity into
        branding and has launched several sub brands associated with the ritual of grooming. For decades, there
        were hair creams with respect to grooming. Brylcream was one of them. Aftershower was one of the brands

        of parachute that became a success with respect to the younger segment. The timing of Aftershower as a
        part of the bathing ritual, and the delivery of hair care benefit in the form of a cream made it a success.
               So, another point that should be been noted is also the timing associated with launch of a brand.

        Parachute got into the grooming rituals of several other kinds of targets segments. For example, there is a
        cultural practice of applying the oil before bath and the cultural practice is quite traditional in several parts of
        the country. Parachute introduced hot oil that consumers can apply before bath. Parachute also has an herbal

        offering for the grooming rituals of consumers.
        The Environmental Direction

               The next aspect that is in line with the importance of consumer behavior is environmental direction.
        Speaking  of  environmental  direction,  the  entire  world  has  changed  over  the  last  couple  of  decades.
        Essentially,  as  the  environment  changes,  product  proliferation  happens,  brand  proliferation  happens,

        consumer lifestyle changes, and all of them are triggered by environmental factors at a very macro level.
               Environmental  factors  can  be  associated  with  technology.  It  can  be  associated  with  government

        policies. It can be associated with a particular trend with respect to consumers’ fashion and it could also be
        associated with economic recession as well as economic well-being. If we have to take into consideration the
        Phlippine context which is extremely diverse with respect to its consumers and culture, the environmental

        factors play an important role.



                                                                                                                5]]></page><page Index="9"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                     Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus

               Let  us  consider  a  city  like  Manila,  where  there  are  different  kinds  of  consumers  ranging  from
        consumers  who  shop  in  small  shops  to  wealthy  consumers  who  shop  in  an  international  ambiance.  A
        knowledge of consumer behavior is required for the analysis of both these segments.

               Before liberalization, the marketing context in the Philippines was completely different. So, when we
        think of environmental directions, we need to think of the post-liberalization and the pre-liberalization periods
        of time in our country.

               Let us take a look at some of the product categories in India that will tell us more about how the
        environment has changed over a period of time: -
               Currently, India has multinational cars from several advanced countries, and consumers can choose

        from a wide variety of offerings. But before liberalization, there was only Ambassador or Fiat as brands in
        India. Then slowly Maruti started opening up the market before the marketplace was full of different kinds of

        car brands. When we consider motorcycle as a category pre 80s was dominated by two brands Yezdi’s and
        Java. At a later point in time, we had different kinds of brands coming into the Indian scenario to make a
        mark. In fact, even Yezdi and Java have been relaunched again in the present-day context. If you take

        example from the footwear industry, Bata was ruling the roost before the 80s, and today there are a host of
        other brands which are there in the competitive scenario. We can go on and on with the categories to reflect

        how environment has changed over a period of time.
               Technology, of course, is an important part of the environmental direction. And the introduction of
        smartphones  in  the  Indian  context  provides  ample  evidence  about  the  online  surfing  with  respect  to

        smartphones, and customized ads with respect to smartphone users, and several other related aspects. The
        point to be noted is that some of these brands can be identified at the behavioral level of the consumer, and
        that is the reason why Consumer Behavior is extremely important. When it comes to some of these brands,

        it means that the behavioral orientation associated with brands vary depending on the context and depending
        on the brand strategies.
        The Organizational Direction

               With respect to Organizational Direction, Philip Kotler's advocacy on Holistic Marketing is extremely
        important. Philip Kotler, in his basic principles of marketing, has dealt with the holistic concept associated

        with marketing. The holistic concept brings in the customer orientation into an organization. The internal
        marketing aspects of the holistic marketing is a very strong aspect of holistic marketing, and Consumer
        Behavior makes a tremendous contribution to the concept of internal marketing.

               Internal marketing brings together several departments in an organization to ensure the organization
        is customer centric. And Consumer Behavior plays an important role in terms of its integration with holistic

        marketing.
               A typical example of this could be the case of ITC. ITC is a large organization that was manufacturing
        cigarettes. And over a period of time, in order to reduce the dependence on cigarettes, the company has

        branched off into many other categories, and that in fact, is an attempt by the organization to come to grips



                                                                                                                6]]></page><page Index="10"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                     Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus

        with environmental changes. ITC, for example, has moved into commodities, soaps, shampoos, chocolates,
        detergents, diary, and coffee to name a few categories.
               Let  us  consider  another  example  with  respect  to  one  of  the  ITC's  product  Aashirvad  wheat.

        Essentially, wheat is a commodity. A commodity is something which is traded more on the price aspects. A
        brand is supposed to enhance the value of the offering. Aashirvad has not only achieved a higher mark and
        quality, it is able to dispense out different kinds of offerings with respect to different kinds of wheat as preferred

        by specific geographical areas and the respective cultures.
               Several of these aspects would not be possible without Consumer Behavior becoming the core part
        of internal marketing. ITC has also strategically used the holistic aspects with respect to its supply chain. The

        supply chain is something which ITC has been able to streamline with respect to its relationship with several
        farmers over a period of several decades. The point to be noted is that several aspects of holistic marketing

        converge, and the converging point is Consumer Behavior.

               III. CONSUMER BEHAVIOR FRAMEWORKS

               The foremost important aspect of consumer behavior is that it does not have an identity of its own. It

        is  inter-disciplinary  in  nature  bringing  together  several  aspects  connected  with  Psychology,  Sociology,
        Anthropology, Artificial intelligence, Evolutionary biology, and any other aspect of the mind that can be applied
        with respect to consumers.

               In fact, in the recent times, neuro marketing and physiological aspects of consumer behavior are also
        being investigated. The interdisciplinary nature of consumer behavior is in fact the unique selling proposition

        of consumer behavior. Consumer behavior consists of the individual processes which the consumer as an
        individual puts into action. This is with respect to how he or she feels, thinks and acts.
               The individual processes in the course are discussed in an individual manner, but in terms of the

        working in consumers mind they are all simultaneously working together, and different types of individual
        processes can be attributed to different kinds of context. The individual processes, for example, could be how

        consumers perceive different kinds of things in the environment. It could be associated with how they learn
        about the environment and the brands.
               Attitude is something which is associated with frames of references that consumers have and make

        use of when they get into decision making. For example, what is a quick frame of reference or attitude with
        respect to a set of consumers on a given category, like cars or soaps? What are the criteria they make use

                                                                                                                7]]></page><page Index="11"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                     Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus

        of with respect to brand decision making? What is the attitude with respect to the consumer on sports? What
        is the attitude with respect to religion? There are different facets of life, and with respect to each facet of life
        the consumer develops an attitude. The attitude is associated with beliefs, feelings and behavioral aspects,

        and these are extremely important aspects from the viewpoint of branding.
               Personality is another individual process. Personality is strongly connected with the motivation for the
        individual. How a consumer’s personality and motivation influence their marketing goals and the selection of

        brands makes an interesting contribution to consumer behavior.
               Another important aspect of Consumer Behavior is a manner in which the consumer interacts with
        groups of other consumers or their friends or their families. These are all different kinds of groups that exert

        an influence on the consumer's mind, which in turn exerts an influence on their decision making with respect
        to brands. These kinds of groups can be called as “reference groups”.

               “Reference groups” is a concept that has an impact on consumers, their decisions, their thinking and
        attitude, and it is fundamental when it is associated with certain kinds of decision making. In fact, the onset
        of social media has recreated the interest with respect to the concept of reference groups because social

        media is all about sharing. The different ways in which consumers make use of their interaction with reference
        groups through their social media behavior is a topical aspect in the study of Consumer Behavior.

               Another part which is extremely important in consumer behavior is culture. In simple terms, culture is
        “shared learning”. How consumers share their learning and how it gets passed on from one generation to
        another- is the essence of culture. Culture is a combination of beliefs, customs, arts, language, food, and

        everything associated with consumers in a specific social context or culture.
               For example, the Asian culture is very different from the European culture. Even with respect of the
        Asian culture, there could be cultural differences with respect to urban college students and rural college

        students, there are cultural differences between software professionals and other kinds of professionals,
        there could be cultural differences between professors and businesspersons.
               Cultural learning is very specific to a social context. For example, cultural aspects of religion and

        values are important in the Indian context, to the extent that they even influence the choices when it comes
        to  foods.  Drawing  an  example  from  the  marketing  context-  India,  perhaps  is  the  only  country  where

        McDonald's or the McDo doesn’t have a beef offering with respect to the food it serves. This is because the
        brand would like to respect the religious value of Indians.
               Values pervade into every aspect of our life, and cultural values are extremely important from the

        viewpoint of marketing. For example, herbal offerings associated with Ayurveda has a strong cultural root,
        and there could be several kinds of brand beliefs associated with Ayurveda. Today we have companies like

        Unilever, Himalaya and several other brands that market herbal offerings. We talk about green products or
        environmental products, and herbal offering form an important part of the cultural beliefs.
               For example, Santoor soap which is very successful with respect to its foray in the Indian context uses

        turmeric and there are several cultural beliefs associated with turmeric and sandalwood. Sandalwood is also
        used by the some of the variants of Santoor. And these beliefs are concerned with the ability of the herbs to

                                                                                                                8]]></page><page Index="12"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                     Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus

        take care of the consumer’s complexion. So, one can notice how the cultural aspects form an inherent part
        of the respective brand position.
               Cultural beliefs associated with mother and children is something special in the Philippine context.

        Let  us  consider  the  advertisement  involving  mother  and  children  over  the  last  sixty  years  in  a  host  of
        categories. That will probably give us some idea about how important mother and child are in the Philippine
        context when it comes advertising. Till date, even in the digital era, mother-child association is carried on by

        brands.
               Let us get into unconventional example concerned with cultural aspects. Dating as a cultural habit is
        not accepted by the mainstream population of India. This is not to say that dating is absent in urban context.

        This is only to emphasize that it is not a traditional belief, or a traditional value associated with Indians. When
        the brand Tinder which is to do with the dating service entered into the Indian context, it ran an advertising

        campaign in India that was associated to mother and daughter. The ad shows the mother encouraging the
        daughter to use the dating application. It is an attempt from the brand to capitalize on the idea “mommy knows
        the best”. The brand believed that the idea of a mother recommending the dating app to the daughter would

        neutralize the awkwardness that Indians associate with dating.
               So, one can see that a clear understanding of the cultural influences on the consumer’s perception of

        a category can enable a brand to introduce new kinds of values despite the presence of strongly entrenched
        traditional values that are opposing in nature.

              IV. CULTURAL SYMBOLISM


               Another interesting aspect with respect to consumer behavior is Cultural Symbolism. It is to be noted
        that any activity associated with marketing happens in the context of culture. This is not only true with respect

        to the Philippine context; this also holds good for any aspect of marketing in any part of the world. Cultural
        symbolism is associated with how cultural aspects play a role in symbolizing certain cultural practices or
        habits.

               Let us take the interesting example of Dettol. Dettol is an antiseptic. And perhaps most consumers
        may not be as involved in an antiseptic as they are with an upmarket, higher-priced to watch. Given the

        history of Dettol in Philippines and its usage by consumer segments, Dettol stings upon the application on a
        wound. It has a specific odor. When we talk about cultural symbolism, the fundamental question is- have
        consumers got used to the stinging sensation and a different kind of odor of Dettol to associate it with the

        curative powers of an antiseptic?



                                                                                                                9]]></page><page Index="13"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                     Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus

               In this case, there is also some kind of sensory branding which comes into the picture. Smelling is a
        kind of sensation; sense of touch is associated with the burning sensation that is created by the brand Dettol.
        So essentially, it is a combination of cultural symbolism and experiential aspects of the brand associated with

        the curative power of Dettol that has created a strong positioning in terms of cultural symbolism.
               Even  in  the  case  of  pain  balm  it  is  very  common  to  find  consumers  trying  to  look  for  a  burning
        sensation as a reflection of brands efficacy in terms of bringing down pain. So, this specific aspect of the

        consumers’ expectations of a pain balm trying to create a hot sensation on application is an example of
        cultural symbolism.
               Let us take another example which is from the commonplace aspects of Consumer Behavior in the

        Indian context. Rusk is made with breadcrumbs and it is an extremely popular product in several parts of the
        country. Rusk has been consumed by Indians for the last several decades. It is not uncommon to find people

        in a roadside tea stall enjoying their conversation over rusk. The recent times Britannia has branded rusk and
        positioned it as a conversation trigger. Rusk in the advertisement of Britannia symbolizes fun times, good
        times and conversations that are a part of a pleasure among a group of consumers. This example shows

        how cultural symbolism can be portrayed with specific advertising in a specific context.
               One of the most interesting cases with respect to cultural symbolism is the case of Kellogg's in the

        Indian context. Possibly only in the Indian context, Kellogg's advertised that Kellogg's corn flakes need to be
        taken with hot milk whereas in several other parts of the world corn flakes is consumed with cold milk. The
        cultural symbolism here is all about hot milk, the fullness, and the food becoming tasty with the addition of

        hot  milk.  Milk  is  a  central  part  of  the  Indian  culture,  and  the  practice  and  ritual  of  heating  milk  before
        consumption has been taken into account in the advertising strategy of Kellogg. In a country with a diverse
        cultural orientation, cultural symbolism plays an important role in consumer behavior.

               V. DIGITALIZATION AND CONSUMER BEHAVIOR



               The traditional four-Ps of marketing namely: Product, Price, Promotion, and Place have been in place
        with respect to the marketing context and the marketeer strategies. At this point in time, as we study the

        importance of the basic principles of Consumer Behavior, we need to be familiar with application of four-Ps
        of marketing before moving into Consumer Behavior. This is because Consumer Behavior gets enhanced
        and harnessed with the understanding of the basic principles like segmentation, brand equity, product line

        management, and advertising management. The traditional Ps of marketing are probably one of fundamental
        ways in which brand differentiation is achieved.

                                                                                                              10]]></page><page Index="14"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                     Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus

               Philip Kotler had introduced the Four Cs of the digital world.
               The fourth Cs are:
               1. Co-creation,

               2. Communal exchanges,
               3. Conversations and
               4. Currency.

               Co-creation is probably the ultimate dream of marketeers. Co-creation is associated with creating a
        product or service with active participation of the consumer with respect to their preferences and needs. The
        next stop for several other brands, especially in online marketing, would be to co-create the offerings at the

        ultimate level of catering to individual preferences and needs. In the Indian context a typical example of co-
        creation is the manner in which companies like Asian Paints tried to create some kind of co-creation in terms

        of taking into account the consumer preferences for colors that they use in their homes.
               Currency is associated with the extent to which consumers provide continuous revenue associated
        with the brand. I'd like to remind the students that Theodore Levitt several decades back talked about every

        product becoming a service, and this is about to become a reality. For instance, in the days to come possibly
        consumers may not be interested in detergents; they may be interested completely in laundry services which

        detergent is only a part of. We already have online laundry services which have been introduced in the Indian
        context.
               Coming back to currency as a revenue stream, the fundamental challenge of digital world for every

        brand is to ensure that the revenue is generated with respect to the brands offerings. And we will see more
        of services being introduced with almost every brand in every category, depending on the consumer segment
        associated with the brand.

               Communal  exchanges  today  are  seen  with  respect  to  websites  like  eBay  and  Olx.  These  are
        websites which have created the culture of consumers exchanging goods and products among themselves.
               Finally, conversation is about how well the word of mouth is harnessed favorably by brands in the

        digital world. The word of mouth in the digital world has got two directions: one is positive and the other one
        is negative. Word of mouth is important both for services as well as brands and brands, and services get built

        up on word of mouth.
               When we consider an example from the personal beauty segment in the Philippines, a brand like Luxe
        Organix serves to illustrate how word of mouth would work in the consumer's minds. Luxe Organix is a brand

        which has a positive word of mouth in the social media. The brand hardly advertises but still has a high level
        of loyal consumers. On the other hand, we have the global example of Galaxy from Samsung caught in

        negative word of mouth. So, word of mouth or conversations can have bi-polar directions and the brand
        needs to be conscious of the same.
               Coming back to the traditional Ps and the contemporary Cs of marketing, your marketeer today has

        to  ensure  that the traditional  Ps  of marketing  are  well  synergized  and  integrated  with  the  contemporary
        aspects of the digital world.

                                                                                                              11]]></page><page Index="15"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY

               • The revival of SunSilk brand of shampoo in the reason times with its website on the SunSilk gang
        of girls, is an excellent example of how word of mouth builds up a brand among the target consumers.
               • Parle-G, which is consumed by both the rich and the poor, had come out with the social media

        campaign that emphasizes the relationship between a consumer and Parle-G.
               So social media makes use of the word of mouth, and the brand needs to ensure it monitors the social
        media as appropriate. It must be noted that consumer behavior is dynamic, exciting, and challenging in any

        competitive context.

              I. IMPORTANCE OF SEGMENTATION AND BRAND POSITIONING

               After the initial session on the introduction to consumer behavior, this lesson will discuss the topic of

        segmentation and brand positioning. At a fundamental level, let us explore the concept of Segmentation and
        its relevance to consumer behavior.
               There are a number of reasons why segmentation is required. The first and foremost reason is that

        the environment is changing in a number of ways. Several decades back, the car manufacturer, like Toyota
        in the Philippines had only one offering. During the initial stages of the seller's market, the specification of the

        car was more at the product category level. The differentiation with respect to a brand was not very intense.
        Over a period of time with consumerism setting in, the purchasing power of consumers had gone up, and as
        a consequence, the preferences of consumers had also changed. This led to brand proliferation. Therefore,

        there is a distinctive need to offer specific benefits at the brand level for a group of target consumers. A typical
        brand in most categories today would have specific product offerings for different kinds of consumers who

        have a similar need.


                                                                                                              13]]></page><page Index="18"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                     Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus

               The fundamental assumption behind segmentation is that different consumers would require different
        benefits  from  the  same  category  and  would  be  willing  to  pay  for  it.  The  follow  up  assumption  at  the
        organizational level is that the firm would focus its resources on the selected segments and thereby on profits.

        This  particular  assumption  from  the  organizational  level  ensures  that  the  organization  has  a  strategic
        advantage in terms of catering to the specific needs of a specific segment. It is to be noted that a given
        segment for a company needs to be profitable as I had said earlier.

               Let us take for example the soap category. In the Philippines, there are different brands of soap
        catering to different kinds of consumers. There is Dove the beauty soap. There is Himalaya, which is a herbal
        soap and then there is a brand called Safeguard, which is a antibacterial soap. Then there is a brand called

        Lux that has been using by the celebrities for the last several decades. Lux brand promises skincare and it
        is endorsed by film celebrities. There is a brand called Silka that has cultural ingredients of papaya and other

        herbal plants that promises youthful skin for a consumer to look younger than her age. There is a soap called
        Kojie San that has kojic acid which promises whiter and clearer skin.
               As one can see, different consumer segments require different benefits, and that is the reason why

        segmentation is required. Besides, the different kinds of consumers perceived that their needs are met by
        the respective offering.

        Brand Benefits
               Brands offer specific benefits. So, when we talk about segmentation in consumer markets, we are
        talking about brand benefits. When we take into account the benefits of several brands, even from the same

        company, we find that they are targeted towards different kinds of segments.
               Let us take for example, the company Casio, the company which makes watches. This company
        offers different brands for different segments. The brand Sonata caters to specific segment that requires

        economical  watches  that  will  also  have  a  visual  appeal.  The  brand  Fastrack  caters  to  a  younger  urban
        segment and Xylys is an offering that caters to the premium segment that requires a brand that is comparable
        to a foreign brand.

               By catering to the specific benefits of consumer group with similar characteristics, a brand ensures
        that  it  does  not  compete  with  another  brand  of  the  same  company.  This  is  a  very  important  aspect  of

        segmentation  at  the  organization  level  and  this  is  also  known  as  Cannibalization.  A  brand  should  not
        cannibalize another brand belonging to the same company, and segmentation has to take care of that.
               If we define the process of segmentation, we need to understand that it is dividing the heterogeneous

        market  into  specific  homogeneous  markets  based  on  consumer  characteristics.  It  is  very  important  to
        understand  that  the  market  is  heterogeneous  in  the  sense  that  it  is  all  mixed  up  with  different  kinds  of

        consumers. The markets are mixed up with the diverse preferences, and a homogeneous market is required
        by  a  marketer  to  ensure  that  he  caters  to  consumers  with  similar  characteristics.  The  consumer
        characteristics could be defined based on demographics like age or the stage in the life cycle. It could be

        income. It could be education. It could be a combination of several demographic factors. The factors can also
        be psychological in nature, and that takes into account the way the consumers live and why they buy specific

                                                                                                              14]]></page><page Index="19"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                     Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus

        categories,  products  and  brands.  In  fact,  specific  characteristics  of  consumers  would  depend  on  their
        lifestyles, which means the manner in which they are living in a given context.
               The context of the Asian market is very different from the context of Western markets due to the

        complexities of cultural factors in the country. For example, there could be segmentation based on cultural
        practices. For instance, the brand Mangal Deep from ITC caters to a specific segment of religious consumers
        who are strongly interested in cultural practices. These practices may involve lighting a scented stick/ incense

        stick as a part of the offering during a prayer, and Mangal Deep is one such offering.
               It is to be carefully noted that very rarely segmentation is based on one characteristic or one base
        which is used to divide the segment. Segmentation in a given context may require more than one criterion.

        When we take again the soap market or the mobile market, there is a fragmentation of price bands.
               So possibly, one of the ways to segment the market is to divide the price bands and make a note of

        the  brands  which  compete  in  a  price  band  before  applying  segmentation  with  respect  to  the  other
        characteristics.

                 positioning through this link:

             II. SEGMENTATION AND MARKETING MIX ELEMENTS

               The  next  stage  of  segmentation  deals  with  the  importance  of  marketing  mix  elements  on

        segmentation. This is because, for any given segment, there needs to be a marketing mix if the segmentation
        has to be effective. So, selecting the marketing mix, which is very appropriate for the segment is a prerequisite
        for useful segmentation.

               Let us take a look at a few points that are useful to drive the point across. There is a term called stimuli
        in consumer behavior. Stimulus is singular, and stimuli is plural. This is a very important definition because

        conceptually it gives an important idea of how the various aspects of the environment impact our senses.
        Stimuli is any input to any of the sensory organs. For instance, it could be a sense of touch when we visit
        shops or malls to buy things. When we start examining the products which we try to buy, there is a sense of

        touch involved. There is a visual stimuli which is involved when we see with our eyes, and we notice brands
        and product categories with visual appeal. There is a sense of smell by which we are able to sniff out the

        basic aroma associated with the product.
               The five senses form an important aspect of input as far as consumer behavior is concerned and this
        can be probably what is known as sensory branding.





                                                                                                              15]]></page><page Index="20"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                     Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus

               The term sensory branding is associated with the senses. When we consider Singapore Airlines, the
        frequent travelers who travel in this Airline may recall a sense of smell. When I talk about matching the
        marketing mix elements with the needs of a given segment, this would mean -selecting the right product, the

        right price, which offers value in the perception of consumers, the right kind of distribution channels, and the
        right mix of promotion, which may also involve digital ways of promoting a product. Several well-known brands
        are examples to illustrate this point. Nike in footwear and Oreo biscuits in consumables are good examples

        to drive home the point.
               What  becomes  important  is  that  the  consumer  interaction  takes  place  in  the  form  of  three  basic
        factors. The first factor is the stimulus factor which is concerned with either something which is external to

        the individual or internal to the individual. For instance, if the individual is feeling hungry, the stimulus factor
        is coming from within the individual. If it is a product or if it is a brand name, it is a kind of stimuli which is

        extracted from the external world. Hence, this stimulus or stimuli is something which creates an impact on
        the need aspect or the want aspect of the consumer. The consumer interest in buying a television will start
        looking out for stimuli concerned with the television. We can also have stimuli that is recalled from the mind

        or memory and that is the reason why we recall well-known brands when we want to purchase a product.
        Consumer Response

               The second aspect of the consumers’ interaction is concerned with the response with respect to the
        stimuli  that  has  been  perceived  by  the  consumer.  It  should  be  noted  that  the  response  may  not  be  a
        behavioral action like buying a product or buying a brand. It can even be  knowing about the brand and

        developing a favorable attitude towards the brand.
               Besides these two factors, there is something known as the intervening variable. In order to study the
        impact  of  stimulus  and  response  on  the  psyche  of  the  consumers,  we  need  to  have  an  idea  about  the

        intervening variables. The intervening variables are internal to the consumers. It could be motivation. It could
        be consumers’ attitude. It could be about how the consumer has learnt about the stimuli. It could be even
        something  to  do  with  the  personality  of  the  consumer.  Without  the  intervening  variables,  there  is  no

        processing of stimuli and we need to understand that the intervening variables are based on the response of
        the individual.

               For instance, the consumer going to the shopping mall and being convinced about a brand of watch
        and buying it means that he has learnt about the brand of watch. He has developed a favorable attitude in
        terms of the appreciation of the watch. He has used his inner motivation to develop that attitude towards the

        watch and finally he has responded by buying the watch. This is a simple example of how the stimulus
        response works with respect to intervening variables.

               There are number of complexities associated with the intervening variables, they may keep changing.
        Motivations may change with the respect to different kinds of life stages. When one is a student, there is a
        different motivation. When one is an executive, there is all together at different kind of motivation. When one

        becomes a father or mother, the motivation is much different. The product category of energy drinks be
        appealed to a consumer segment that has a favorable attitude when one is young, and it may undergo a

                                                                                                              16]]></page><page Index="21"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                     Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus

        change with respect to attitude when one becomes older. So, these are some of the intricacies associated
        the model of consumer response to the stimulus and the usage of intervening variables.
        Marketing Mix Elements

               We can look at marketing mix elements as a kind of stimulus or stimuli factor because they have an
        important impact on the psyche of the consumer. Marketing mix elements, are the four P’s of marketing. This
        is the classical marketing mix. Several other aspects may have been added to the marketing mix elements,

        but essentially, it is the marketing mix element that provides the differentiation with respect to a particular
        brand.
               What is to be noted is that when there is a stimulus from the respective brand or the company, there

        is also a competitive stimulus from a variety of brands, which are associated with the particular product
        category targeting the same set of consumers.

               A consumer who is interested in buying a brand of premium car like Audi, maybe equally interested
        in brands like Mercedes and BMW. His stimulus factor is not only associated with the specific brand, it is also
        associated with the competitive environment as well.

               To  make  things  simple,  let  us  consider  different  brands  of  the  same  company.  In  the  Philippine
        context, Toyota is a car manufacturing company, and it has different kinds of brands. Hino is one, Lexus as

        one, Ranz is one. So, when we consider the marketing mix of the respective brand like, Hino or Lexus or
        Ranz, we find that the marketing mix elements associated are competing with several other brands in the
        same segment. So, it is essential to appreciate at this stage that the stimulus factors do not only come from

        the marketing mix elements of the respective brand, but also from the offerings of competitive brands.
               Stimulus factors could also come from the cultural environment. For example, the fitness culture is
        catching on, and Sugar Free is a brand that possibly appeals to the younger segment because of its fitness

        association. In this case, there is a cultural trigger associated with the category as well as a brand. Fitness
        and health are segments that have recently emerged in the Indian urban culture, and several brands compete
        in the sphere.

               Finally, segmentation provides a very clear focus for an organization in a cluttered environment. If we
        take the online fashion brand like Zalora, it focuses on a specific segment. The important point to be noted is

        that  the  organization  selects  one  or more  segments,  depending  on  its  strategic  pursuit  of  how  it  should
        approach the market as well as the consumer segments.

                  elements through this link:

              III. TYPES OF BRANDS AND VALUE


        Brand Differentiation
               Now that we have some idea about segmentation, let us cover two more important aspects that are
        concerned with segmentation and brand positioning. The first aspect is about brand differentiation and the

        second aspect is about brand positioning. Let us quickly get an idea about how brands are differentiated.
               With  brand  proliferation,  different  segments  emerge  within  a  category  and  there  is  a  need  to
        differentiate a brand regardless of what it sells in a given context. About 80 years back, because of the lack

        of intense competition, there was little differentiation. The classical concept of unique selling proposition of
        the USP is still applicable as a brand needs to ensure what it sells is differentiated among its competitors.

        The  USP  or  the  Unique  Selling  Proposition  fundamentally  drives  the  brand  differentiation  and  it  was
        advocated by Rosser Reeves during the sixties and after almost 6 decades we find that that USP is still
        relevant today.

               To understand how unique selling proposition works, you need to understand what the different kinds
        of  brands  are.  There  may  be  three  different  kinds  of  brands:  Functional,  Symbolic,  and  Hedonic  or

        Experiential. It is to be noted that for our purposes of understanding, we are trying to understand the brands
        in a compartmentalized manner as Functional or Symbolic or Hedonic. In actual practice, functional, symbolic,
        and hedonic may not be all that exclusive, which means that a functional brand can also convey a symbolic

        benefit or the hedonic benefit. But most successful brands have a dominant aspect related to the kind of
        brand. The dominant aspect could be functional, or it could be symbolic, or it could be hedonic. Hedonic is to
        do with a sensual pleasure.

               Let us consider a few examples. The functional brand is one which provides a solution for a problem
        and the consumer is able to clearly perceive the tangible benefit. For instance, the detergent brand offering
        a stain free performance is a functional benefit. The brand of toothpaste offering fresh breath is a functional

        benefit, a brand like Sensodyne Toothpaste, which offers a solution to sensitivity of teeth is also functional.
        Any brand that offers a solution to a problem or that offers a clear-cut benefit is a functional brand.

               The Fastrack brand shows the time, and it also has a number of features of a watch at the same time,
        the dominant value of this watch is a symbolic benefit. A symbolic benefit can be an emotion. It can be
        prestige. It can be the sense of belongingness or it can be something very psychological in nature. The point

        is, symbolic is internal to the consumer as opposed to the functional benefit that is internal to the product.
        Karatometer is something which will tell the consumer about the genuineness of gold. So, there is a symbolic

        trust of trust associated with the brand Titan that had introduced the meter to check the purity of gold. Forever
        21 is another brand that is into fashion, and it is very symbolic of the state of art fashion as associated with
        the youngsters.

               Several brands of shampoo have a styling factor, and this is also symbolic in nature. Symbolic could
        also be associated with the emotion. The joy of gifting a diamond is very symbolic in nature. The well-known

                                                                                                              19]]></page><page Index="24"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY

        brand De Beers is a brand of diamond jewelry that is associated with the ritual of gifting during the wedding
        engagement and this signifies warmth and affection with respect to the context.
               Finally,  the  hedonic  factor  is  experiential  in  nature.  When  we  say  experiential,  it  could  be  the

        experience  of  functional  aspect,  or  it  could  be  the  experience  that  is  very  sensual  in  nature.  Hedonism
        specifically means an experience that is sensual in nature. A good example of hedonism is the case of a Red
        bull drink which offers an experience with respect to the parties associated with the youngsters. It offers a

        sensual experience when a consumer drinks it. Starbucks or Cafe Coffee Day in the Indian context also offers
        the sensual experience of visiting a cafe and spending time with friends. It is be noted that even Red Bull,
        which is a hedonic brand, may have a functional benefit of having a high caffeine that keeps an individual

        awake.
               So, these are some of the primary kinds of brands and we need to understand that there is a dominant

        part of the USP which is internal to the consumer, and that is important from the viewpoint of segmentation
        and positioning.
        Value

               By understanding unique selling proposition and the type of brands, we have come to the next aspect
        of defining value. The value in simple terms is a benefit-sacrifice equation. Benefits are associated with what

        the consumer receives, and sacrifices indicate the sacrifices made by the consumer in terms of his money,
        effort, his time and even his psychological energy.
               Value is always defined with respect to a segment, and this is very critical in segmentation. Different

        segments seek different kinds of values from a brand. Value can be of three kinds. It can be functional value
        or symbolic value or hedonic value, as we have already discussed.
               Finally, the marketing mix elements combined with the needs offer a specific value to a segment. For

        example, Apple's iPhone is a product with the number of features. It is available in specific distribution outlets,
        and it creates a unique experience. It is priced as a premium, which indicates a specific value associated
        with this and this value is both symbolic as well as functional. But predominantly, when one looks at iPhone

        despite the presence of functional value, the symbolic association is dominant because the usage of a brand
        of mobile phone would probably indicate something about the prestige associated with the user of a brand.

             IV. TARGETING AND POSITIONING


               There  are  three  important  aspects  in  what  we  call  as  the  segmentation  process.  They  are
        segmentation, targeting, and positioning. Unless the three aspects are covered, the basics of segmentation
        and positioning are incomplete. A company must target specific segments through targeting specific groups

        of consumers. The number of segments which are targeted by a company would depend on its own strategy,
        its resources, and profitability levels.
               There are companies like Cadbury - in the Chocolate Category, for instance, which believed that there

        should  be  something  for  everyone  and  may  have  several  segments  in  place.  There  may  be  a  specific
        company which try to target specific segments. When we take Unilever India, the company has Red Label

        Tea, it has Taj Tea, and it also has Tazaa Tea for the respective segment. There may also be a company
        which  targets  a  very  small  cross  section  of  the  entire  market  known  as  the  niche  market.  The  niche  is
        generally highly profitable. It has got special needs and it demands a premium. For instance, Ferrari cars can

        be considered as marketing themselves to a distinct set of consumers who would prefer the offering. There
        are important aspects that are to be considered when segments are targeted, and these are very strategic

        aspects from the viewpoint of a company.
               Changing environment is one of the important aspects when we take the example of watches for
        children that is introduced by Titan. Environment changes over a period of time and today, we have an

        environment where there can be a watch for kids. Changing environment also produces a number of variants
        in the brand, and that results in targeting different segments. When we consider the fairness cream brand
        Fair and Lovely, it has several variants and they target specific segments. We have an environment where

        the  face  wash  is  extremely  important  in  the  make-up  kit  of  youngsters  and  the  changing  environment
        produces very different kinds of segments in the face wash market.
               The market potential is yet another factor that has a strategic impact on segmentation. The cafe

        market in India is an excellent example of the kind of market potential it offers in the future. The category of
        optical wear in India has tremendous amount of potential for branded wear. Branded wear means that there

        are a number of unbranded offerings in the market and branded wear offers a lot of potential in the optical
        market in the Philippine context.
               Depending on the potential and strategy of the company, specific segments are targeted. This is an

        important aspect because there is always a question of what segments are to be targeted. In practice, it may
        be very difficult to follow a highly theoretical approach, and there may be a need to experiment with respect

        to segmentation, positioning, and targeting with all the primary and secondary data in place. When I say
        experiment, it is not that one should keep on launching products and experiment. The experiment refers to
        the kind of combination and permutations that will be ideal for a company in terms of its resource utilization.

        Brand Positioning
               The important concept of brand positioning which is considered to be the anchor for a brand. This is
        because brand positioning has an impact on the consumer psyche, and the transition from a product to a

        brand happens through brand positioning. There are a number of aspects concerned with brand positioning
        and consumer behavior.
               For instance, the decision made by a brand to use a celebrity is an exercise that may involve brand

        positioning. It should be noted that brand possessing is to do with the mind of the consumer. While there may
        be a number of attributes and characteristics, the manner in which the brand enters the mind of the consumer
        is the essence of brand positioning.

               The concept of brand positioning was pioneered during the early part of the 70s by Ries and Trout.
        This is an important value addition to the conceptual thinking because it provides a mental angle to the brand.

        Brand positioning is with respect to creating a unique image in the mind of the consumer about the brand.
               The Starbucks, for instance, has a unique image in terms of the experiential atmosphere it provides
        for consumers. Colgate over a period of time has established itself with a unique image of a trusted oral care

        brand. Dove which is a soap brand in India has the unique aspect of having a moisturizer in a soap to take
        care  of the  complexion.  Positioning  enables  a brand  to  occupy  a focused  slot  in  the mind  of the  target

        consumers.
               Brand positioning can happen in several ways, and the company has to take into consideration the
        proposition of the brand as well as the context when it tries to position a brand. When we talk about a brand

        in the category of Basmati rice, there are several brands in Basmati rice. And given the culture of entertaining
        guests on special occasions, Basmati rice may be used for special occasions. Domex is a brand associated
        with bathroom cleaners. Domex offers the benefit of a clean bathroom. Surf Excel offers the benefit of a stain

        removal.
               Positioning can also be done by user imagery. User imagery means the typical user of a brand is
        portrayed in the positioning of a brand. An advertisement for a brand of jeans is a good example of how the

        user imagery is portrayed in positioning.
               Lifestyles can also be used to position a brand. Lifestyle essentially means the manner in which a

        consumer  spends  his  time  and  money.  For  example,  a  brand  of  SUV  or  Sports  Utility  Vehicle,  may  be
        positioned as an outdoor activity for a family that wants to get away on a weekend. A brand of coffee may be
        positioned with respect to joyful moments in consumers’ life. The Nescafe is a brand of coffee positioned with

        respect to celebrating special moments or romantic moments. Hence, it is a judicious combination of value
        and positioning growth that decides the effectiveness of brand positioning.

        Brand Positioning and Consumer Behavior
               How is Consumer Behavior connected with brand positioning? There are a variety of ways in which
        consumer behavior can make use of brand positioning. For instance, a brand needs to revitalize and reinforce

        itself over a period of time and this is accomplished by a combination of positioning and consumer behavior.
        Let us consider a few examples.

                                                                                                              22]]></page><page Index="27"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                     Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus

               Raymond fabric from the Indian context is a good example. Raymond during the 80s used to be
        positioned  as  a  premium  brand  of  suiting  for  corporate  executives.  Over  a  period  of  time  with  the
        environmental changes there is a need to reposition the brand and during the 90s, Raymond positioned itself

        as  a fabric for the  complete  man. The complete  man  in this  context  meant  that the man  in  a changing
        environment  will  not  only  be  a  good  professional  but  also  would  be  a  good  family  man  sharing  the
        responsibilities associated with the family.

               Ariel Detergent brand that was introduced in the Philippine context during the late 80s had brought in
        a digital campaign that was captioned share the workload. Share the workload here meant that Ariel was
        advocating that men in the household also share the household chores that were traditionally perceived to

        be  the  responsibility  of  the  housewife. With  women's  empowerment gaining  ground  in  recent times, the
        stereotype of a traditional housewife is fading at least in the urban context in India. Ariel with its campaign

        had brought in a strong sense of women's empowerment associated with the brand. Hence, the positive
        attitude  of  consumers towards  the  brand  is  likely  to  be  strengthened  and  this  is  an  important  aspect of
        consumer behavior.

               Raga was a watch in the Indian context, introduced as an ethnic watch wear exclusively targeting
        ladies and it resembled a jewelry. Over a period of time, that stereotype of modern young lady professional

        underwent a radical change. Raga was repositioned as the watch for the self-reliant and independent lady
        who asserts herself realizing her legitimate rights. There is a story line that was built up to convey the self-
        reliance and independence associated with the watch brand in terms of its user imagery. In this example, the

        personality concepts of Consumer Behavior are associated with brand positioning.
               Cadbury chocolate, the molded version from the Cadbury company was always positioned towards
        kids during the 70s and 80s. During the 90s, Cadbury's positioned the molded version of chocolates to adults

        using the changes that were associated with the cultural practices of celebrating happy moments.
               Let us consider another example, which is of Tide brand, again from the detergent category. Tide was
        a detergent brand that was associated for decades with whiteness. The brand was positioned initially towards

        a specific socio-economic class of consumers. And over a period of time it had not only launched variants, it
        had  also  created  a  link  between  the  brand  benefit  and  the  self-esteem  of  the  consumer.  One  of  its  ad

        campaigns  positioned  its  benefit  associated  with  whiteness  of  clothes  linked  with  the  self-esteem  of the
        protagonist in the ad. The ad emphasizes how the whiteness of clothes created the confidence required for
        a young and successful working professional who is from a humble background in terms of financial standing

        and social prestige. The object of such an ad is to ensure that associations created by the ad gets transferred
        to the brand. This would enable the brand to make a positive impact on the psyche of the consumer.

               The classical approach of segmentation and brand positioning explores the mind of the consumer
        and provides a direction for the brand in a given context.

              V. PSYCHOGRAPHICS


               The process of segmentation, targeting, and positioning will not be complete without a mention of
        psychographics and its impact on positioning. Psychographics is captured by the activities, interests, and
        opinions of the consumer target segment. For instance, when we talk about fashion fabrics, we have different

        kinds of apparel namely formal wear, sportswear, social wear, party wear, and there are many kinds of brands
        in the apparel sector. A typical psychographic analysis of a consumer segment shows what kinds of activities
        are associated strongly with the consumer segment. What kinds of opinions are expressed by the consumer

        segment on a variety of issues and what kinds of interests are pursued by the consumer – forms an important
        role in understanding the psychographics.

               For example, a group of youngsters who are interested in fashion may be highly interested in sports.
        Hence, they  may  be  visiting sports  venues. There may  be  reading  sports magazines,  and  they  may  be
        listening to sports commentary. These aspects are to be considered by the apparel brand when it wants to

        get into the process of segmentation, targeting, and positioning.
               A brand which is formal in nature, for example, a brand like Park Avenue in the Indian apparel sector

        may possibly be interested in exploring the usage of an English news channel as the media channel for its
        advertisements, taking into consideration the brands target segment. It is to be noted that the activities,
        interests, and opinions of the target segment need to be in line with the product category so that the marketeer

        will be able to appreciate how it impacts the product category and the desired positioning of the brand.
               Finally, this basic lesson gives an idea of how segmentation, targeting, and positioning is all about
        and its linkages with consumer behavior. Module does not deal with operational aspects of how segmentation

        and positioning can be accomplished for the brand. Students can refer to the prescribed textbook after going
        through this lecture and attempt the exercises provided for this module. Operational aspects of segmentation
        and positioning of a brand needs to be experienced by every student of consumer behavior.

                                       CONSUMER DECISION MAKING





                Instructional Objectives

               Lesson 3 covers the WEEK 5 - 8 of the course syllabus. After the completion of the lesson, students

               will be able to:

               1.  Explain the different types of decision and how these decision different from one another in
                   terms of the amount of thought and analysis a consumer would invest in it.
               2.  Identify what prompts a consumer to buy a product;

               3.  Determine the influence of culture on one’s thoughts, preferences, and attitude;
               4.  Find out how a consumer finds contentment in the purchase one has made to determine if it is

                   a real satisfaction or just a cognitive bias;
               5.  Classify how motivation and emotions influence a consumer’s decision to make a purchase;
               6.  Discover how social judgment theory provides perspective to understand the need want aspect

                   of consumer.



              I. TYPES OF DECISION AND DECISION MAKING


               Decision making is one of the complex areas of human behavior, and we are trying to apply decision
        making to how consumers decide on a host of aspects. Let us look at different kinds of buying decisions. For
        instance, buying a car, purchasing a snack and grabbing an ice cream just by seeing it. The fundamental

        point  which  comes  to  one's  mind  is  -  do  all  these  decisions  involve  the  same  effort  and  involvement?
        Obviously not.
               Consumer  decision  making  can  involve  day-to-day  decisions.  It  can  involve  well  thought-out

        decisions.  It  can  also  involve  impulsive  decisions,  which  are  taken  on  the  spur  of  the  moment.  Why  is
        consumer  decision  making  so  complex?  The  complexity  of  consumer  decisions  can  be  attributed  to  a

        combination  of  aspects.  These  include  the  motivation  of  the  consumer. When  we  say  motivation  of  the
        consumer, it is extremely complex because we are all different kinds of individuals. It could be because of
        the  money  involved.  Here  again,  we  are  talking  about  money  that  is  used  to  buy  essentials  and  the

        discretionary money in which we buy several discretionary aspects and for consumer behavior, discretionary
        buying and discretionary aspects are extremely important. It could be because of the involvement levels of

        consumers. We get involved with respect to the sugar, which we add to our coffee, we also get involved when
                                                                                                              24]]></page><page Index="32"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                     Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus

        we buy a costly apartment. So, the degree of involvement also matters. The manner in which information
        processing occurs also adds on to the complexity.
               There are times when we want to have an exhaustive processing of information. There are times

        when we do not process information at all. So, the combination of aspects is extremely difficult to probably
        decipher completely, but to the extent possible we try to use consumer behavior to analyze these decisions
        of consumers.

        Types of Consumer Decision Making
               Essentially, there can be three kinds of decision making. One is the routine decision-making where
        we talk about routine decisions like reordering milk, mundane breakfast, and the basic essentials. There

        could be intermediary decision-making where we are talking about some kind of information such as in the
        case of trying to get a new snack. There are a number of snacks which a consumer is using on everyday

        basis and suddenly finds a new snacking which is available in the market and they would like to have some
        information about it. The third kind of decision making is all about elaborate decision making where there is
        a tremendous amount of information processing as well as a high degree of involvement. For example, buying

        a car for most people would involve elaborate decision making.
               Let us now consider a basic decision making that involves elaborate decision making. In the Indian

        context, for instance, let us talk about person who is trying to buy a car for the first time. When we talk about
        entry level cars, there is Suzuki’s brand Alto, another car brand Eon and in the recent times Kwid from Renault
        also has entered into that scenario. Now, with respect to elaborate decision making, the individual has some

        kind  of  value  mapped  into  his  internal  thinking.  The  value  could  be  with  respect  to  style,  economy,
        maintenance services and so on. The point to be noted is that while all consumers would want certain basic
        essentials with respect to the car, with respect to comfort, with respect to convenience, with respect to space,

        there is a dominant aspect, which a consumer may probably  want to have in his decision making. This
        dominant aspect is one of those important aspects when he defines a value for himself in terms of what he
        looks in a car.

               When we take these three brands into consideration, the consumer has to decide on one brand. The
        consumer tries to evaluate many of the factors associated with his value choice across these three brands.

        In addition, there is also the marketing communication or the brand communication or the advertisements of
        the brand, which comes into the picture. For example, Kwid has an advertisement where a celebrity endorses
        the brand. Kwid’s advertisement is also all about trying to showcase its features. The whole proposition of

        Kwid is trying to offer as many features as possible with respect to a small car. Kwid also has the imagery of
        an SUV, a sports utility vehicle that is built into a small car. So, with all these aspects, the question is whether

        the consumer will be able to probably get his decisions influenced by the ad. So, this is just to give you an
        idea about how an elaborate decision-making works.
               When we study less intense decision making, this is connected to a consumer searching for a snack

        which is a limited information-based decision making. The routine snacks which are available in the market



                                                                                                              25]]></page><page Index="33"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY

        are cake, biscuits, ice creams, delicacies like a Samosa, and new age diet-based snacking like Sky flakes
        and Muesli and so on.
               So, in this case, one needs to look at it from the consumers’ viewpoint as well as the marketer’s

        viewpoint. The essential point to be noted is - how should the marketeer create an involvement with respect
        of the snacking. The involvement, of course, is to do with the mindset of the consumer. The involvement is
        nothing but the degree of personal relevance. So here, when we talk about a snack, the degree of personal

        relevance can be with respect to the diet, can be with respect to the benefits of a diet, can be with respect to
        the benefit of the diet not only for health reasons but also for reasons of appearance. When healthy snack is
        being taken, there is always a promise of not only feeling good but looking good as well.

               Thus,  many  of  these  aspects  need  to  be  considered  by  the  marketeer  when  he  develops  a
        communication with respect to positioning their snack; and the snack needs to be positioned against several

        other snacks which are already present in the market. So, the brand positioning has to take into account the
        decision-making process of the individual.
        Degree of Involvement

               In addition to many of these things, there is also an additional complexity of enduring involvement and
        situational involvement. For example, there could be consumers who are probably interested in a snack just

        to reduce their weight and feel good. There are also consumers who in an enduring manner are probably
        involved with respect to diet-snacking. For these kinds of consumers, maintaining the diet is an eternal effort.
        So, the marketeer, when he plans his communication, whether it is advertising or point of purchase posters,

        needs to take into account whether the target segment reflects an enduring involvement or a situational
        involvement.
               Besides these kinds of decision making, there is also something known as impulse buying. When a

        consumer sees an ice cream, sees a probably an attractive apparel for that matter, they may feel like simply
        buying it. So, psychologically, there is some tension created because the brand or the product is seen by the
        consumer and the tension is resolved only when the consumer buys it.

               In this case, this is known as impulsive buying because the consumer just wants to buy the product
        without going much into the consequences of making the buy. So, to start with, these are some kinds of

        aspects which are probably preliminary from the viewpoint of decision making.

             II. CONSUMER DECISION MAKING INFLUENCERS



               Let us take a look at what exactly is consumer decision making and several aspects of consumer
        behavior that has linkages with consumer decision making.
               Consumer decision making consists of mental and physical activities undertaken by consumers to

        acquire consumer products and services to fulfill their needs and wants. Essentially, it has to do with the
        needs which are basic deprivations, and wants or aspirations. When we talk about trying to have water for
        thirst, which is a need, when we want a Coke to drink that is a want.

               Needs  and  wants  are  absolutely  important  aspects  with  regard  to  consumer  behavior  because
        consumer decision making starts only with needs and wants. There is an actual situation and a desired

        situation. Whether it is water, whether it is thirst, whether the shelter or a real estate property, whether it is
        indulgence with respect to our favorite entertainment, everything starts from needs and wants. Everything
        starts from actual situation and desired situation as perceived by the individual consumer. It is to be noted

        that a feeling of discomfort that exists between the actual situation and the desired situation is not imposed
        by an external aspect. When we talk about advertisements, they do influence the individual, but the actual

        discomfort is generated within the individual. This is an important part as well as the decision-making aspects
        are concerned.
               The next aspect of the definition is with respect to mental and physical activities. When consumers

        start thinking about the Nike shoe which they want to buy, or when the consumers starts thinking about the
        state-of-the-art technological mobile phone they want to buy, consumer decision making starts. Just thinking
        about the product, thinking about the brand, thinking about the stimuli triggers up the mental stimulation, and

        that is precisely what the environment does. So, some part of the stimulation is responsible because of the
        external  forces  and  some  part  of  the  stimulation  comes  from  within.  So,  the  stimulation  created  by  the
        environment and the stimulation experienced by the individual results in the consumer showing interest in

        the brand, acquiring the brand, using the brand, and disposing of the brand and buying a new brand or a new
        product category. Consumer decision making is dynamic in nature.

               So, other than the mental activity, there is a physical activity as well. The consumer browses through
        the internet. The consumer goes to the mall, consumer goes to the shop, the consumer examines the product,
        the consumer reads the label of the brand. The consumer tries to buy the brand or the product. So, that's the

        physical activity which is involved with respect to consumer decision making. So, quickly trying to make a
        note of a consumer decision making, this involves a physical activity, this involves mental activities, this

        involves a stimulation from the environment, this involves stimulation from within, and this is also involves
        discomfort  experience  with  respect  to  the  actual  situation  and  the  desired  situation.  Many  aspects  are
        responsible for the consumer trying to show interest to a decision making eventually trying to decide on the

        decision he or she makes.


                                                                                                              27]]></page><page Index="35"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                     Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus

        Consumer Decision Making Influencers
               Let us take a look at the other aspects of decision making. There are decisions on what to acquire
        and when to acquire; how to consume it; how to acquire; how often to acquire; where to acquire; where to

        consume; and how to dispose of the product because disposal is also an important aspect in both from the
        environmental viewpoint as well as from generating value based on the old product from the viewpoint of the
        consumer. So, when we talk about different kinds of decisions associated with the consumer in terms of

        acquisition, consumption, the manner of acquisition, the place where it is acquired, and the disposal aspects
        of consumer decision-making. There are many insights which come into the picture.
               Let us consider a consumer trying to buy a premium watch. Premium watch like Omega or Rolex or

        any such brand. The first aspect to be noted is- how does the consumer experience the motivation to buy the
        watch? Is he/she inspired probably to have a reward for his/her own efforts of accomplishment or is he/she

        inspired to impress his/her friends because a number of them hold a brand in high esteem or is he/she
        inspired by both these aspects? This fundamentally forms a motivation to buy the Rolex watch.
               The other related question is when does he/she want to buy it? Does he/she want to buy it when

        he/she gets into the first job? Does he/she want to buy it when he/she gets a promotion? Does he/she want
        to buy it when he/she gets married? Does he/she want to buy it to celebrate a special occasion? There are

        many possibilities and the marketeer will have to probably get into this possibilities.
               The other aspect is where the customer wants to buy the watch. Does he/she want to visit a retailer
        who is located in a Bazaar or does he/she want to go to a shopping mall and experience the showroom

        effects when buying the brand? Would he/she want to accompany a friend to buy the brand or would he want
        to go alone to buy the brand?
               The next associated aspect is where does the money going to come from for the buy? Is he/she going

        to save the money? Is he/she going to buy it on installment? Is he/she going to wait until the time he/she
        uses his/her discretionary money to buy a premium watch? Does he/she expect somebody else or does
        he/she expect the watch as a gift? So, these are many, many aspects that are concerned with the consumer.

        This is a hypothetical example. For example, when they take the example of a Casio brand, it came into the
        Filipino picture positioning itself as a gift. And people belonging to several segments, possibly thought of a

        Casio when they wanted to gift something to someone else.
               The other aspect to be noted is that services involve consumer decision making just as products do.
        For example, a consumer taking a vacation. So, does he really look into the website? Does he/she look into

        the  word  of  mouth  on  the  web?  Does  he/she  look  into  the  word  of  mouth  with  respect  to  his  friend's
        experiences? What is he going to do with respect to his travel? With respect to his accommodation? Is he/she

        going to look into the shared accommodation aspects? Is he/she going to look into the new internet-based
        models of booking accommodation? So, there are many other aspects which are included when we talk about
        decision making associated with services.

             III. ROLE OF CULTURE IN DECISION MAKING


               Let us quickly take a look at how the cultural backdrop affects the decision making in a context like
        Philippines. We have brands like McDonald, and Omega. These are Western brands and they stand for
        specific brand propositions. For example, McDonald is always about the group experience that is to do with

        enjoying the meal with friends.
               Furthermore, McDonald is all about the values associated with a quick meal, inexpensive meal, clean
        meal, and so on. This is the proposition all over the world. When we talk about again something like a

        Mercedes as a brand, Mercedes stands for prestige and even in the Indian context, Mercedes is bought for
        a symbolic appeal. These are one set of brands.

               Let us take the other set of brands that clearly tells us how the ethnic aspects of decision making is
        slightly different. For example, when we take a brand like Kellogg's, they entered into the Indian context
        during the mid-90s and at a later point in time, they started advertising the Kellogg Cornflakes with hot milk.

        Kellogg  Cornflakes  is  always  taken  with  cold  milk  in  several  other  parts  of  the  world.  It  is  the  symbolic
        significance of warm milk in the Indian context that prompted Kellogg’s to introduce cornflakes with warm

        milk.
               Let us also consider a hair cream Aftershower. Aftershower is an interesting example of how a hair
        cream after almost five decades of existence has assumed importance with respect to the grooming ritual of

        the consumer. Aftershower, as a name implies, is to be applied after the shower, and that was introduced at
        a time when fashion hair gel, hair cream, where all connected with consumer segments involving youngsters.
               Let us also study the case of hair oil Parachute Jasmine. The Jasmine is a flower in the Indian context,

        which  in  several  parts  of  the  country  is  being  used  for  decorating  the  hair.  Jasmine  has  a  very  unique
        fragrance  that  is  associated  with  the  ethnic  aspects  of  decorating  the  hair  using  Jasmine  for  religious
        purposes and there are several other aspects of Jasmine in the consumer's mind. So, Parachute Jasmine

        was a hair oil that was positioned towards the respective consumer segment.
               There are several other examples of how to take into account the cultural aspects before entering into

        the decision-making domain of the consumer. So, culture is something that needs to be dovetailed into the
        marketing program when consumer decision making is considered.
        Rational and Irrational Decisions

               There are rational and irrational decisions. Rational means that it is not completely rational from the
        economic choice viewpoint. It only means that consumers are trained to apply the reason when coming out

        with  a  decision-making  as  we  had  examined  the  elaborate  decision-making  sometime  back.  “Irrational”
        emphasize  within  quotes  because  it  is  just  not  irrational,  it  is  more  of  an  emotional  decision  where  the
        consumer is not given in for rational arguments.

               So, the power of emotion can be find in a variety of contexts wherever consumer choices being made.
        Emotion has become extremely important in today's context where the consumer across a host of categories

                                                                                                              30]]></page><page Index="38"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                     Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus

        decide on the brand, not just on rational decision making but also with respect to emotions that go along with
        rational decision making.
               A very interesting example is the case of the brand Zumba where millions of consumers all over the

        world celebrate their fitness program with Zumba dance. Zumba originated from one of the South American
        countries and one of the founders of Zumba wanted to have a very appealing caption which said, "Ditch the
        Workout, Join the Party". One can see the emotional element with respect to a dance that had a several

        rational benefits associated with health and fitness. So, there is a global example to show how the power of
        emotion can appeal. In the earlier case, we had a discussion on the experiential utility with respect to decision-
        making, where the pleasurable aspects of a brand, in that case a brand of wine was happening even without

        the consumer fully not being aware that he is experiencing the effects of wine. In this case, it is a conspicuous
        emotion that has appeal to millions of people all over the world. So, there are a number of categories in the

        Philippine context that use emotions such as shampoos, chocolates, soaps, cosmetics and the category goes
        on and on.
               There is another interesting aspect that is to do with Automatic Information Processing. This is an

        extremely  interesting  aspect  because  consumers  may  process  information  automatically  without  their
        complete knowledge and at the same time, the automatic processing has an impact on their feelings, goals,

        and behaviors. That is the concept of Adaptive Unconscious which means that the consumer can use the
        automatic processing system to create an automatic set of behaviors concerned with a routine matters. From
        a non-marketing context, if this is to be understood, driving a car is an example. Once a consumer learns

        how to drive a car, he/she does not put all his/her attention for several years unless there is a deviation on
        the road. It is just an automatic process that takes over the driving. So similarly, even in consumer behavior
        automatic processing happens with respect to our habitual behaviors towards the basic essentially as like

        bread,  butter,  and  several  other  choices  like  detergent  powders,  and  etc.,  unless  the  consumer  is  fully
        convinced consciously to change. The whole idea of automatic choices is to ensure that the brain makes use
        of resources towards important things leaving the mundane aspects to automatic decision-making.

             IV. ROLE OF EMOTIONS IN DECISION MAKING



               Let us make a reference to the various models of decision-making in textbooks. These models are
        extremely useful in terms of explaining decision-making, but a student of consumer behavior will be able to
        have a comprehensive view of decision-making if he or she takes into account a number of other factors

        other than the basic models in the textbooks.
               For example, there is a model which are runs from decision-making to post purchase evaluation. The
        model is sequential in nature. This model is extremely useful, and this can be found in almost every textbook

        on consumer behavior. In order to enhance the value of the model, there are number of other factors to be
        considered.

        Motivation and Emotion
               Motivation of the consumers is something extremely important. Motivation is the actionable part of the
        consumer, which propels the consumers into action. Without specific motivation or without the direction of

        the motivation, a consumer will not be able to focus his efforts. The need and want aspect, which we have
        discussed  sometime  back  is  extremely  important  because  from  the  viewpoint  of  motivation  a  need  is

        something that needs to be rectified as it goes down. For example, when our car breaks down, it goes away
        from the need level and the car needs to be repaired. When our energy goes down, we have to consume a
        snack to ensure that the level of energy comes back to that of the original need level.

               What is an aspect which is shaped by individual aspects of personality, lifestyle aspects and a specific
        culture in which the individual lives? The aspect of involvement is interesting because it offers a  synergy
        between motivation, need, and want aspects, and eventually the manner in which the consumer gets involved

        with respect to the product category or the brand.
               Concept of involvement can be divided into high involvement and low involvement. Involvement is the
        degree of personal relevance associated with a particular consumer's perception. There are essentially a

        number of aspects which differentiate low involvement with high involvement. For example, in the case of low
        involvement,  which  is  associated  with  buying  a  battery,  for  example,  the  consumer  is  interested  in  a

        satisfactory performance. The consumer would not worry about the prestige appeal of the battery. This is
        with respect to most of the consumers, the consumer would not probably have an active interest with respect
        to sources of information concerned with the battery. He/she would only reflect passive learning in terms of

        absorbing information about the battery from the environmental sources.
               So, the challenge for the marketer is how does he/she raise the involvement levels with respect to

        low involvement mindset products. So, low involvement is characterized by a specific kind of approach from
        the consumer's end. For example, a consumer who's interested in a soft drink may exist, may reflect a low
        involvement. He/she may first buy the product, experience the product, and then develop an attitude whereas,

        in the case of high involvement, the consumer goes through a number of sources, develops an attitude, and
        then makes a final buy as in the case of a car.

                                                                                                              33]]></page><page Index="41"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY

               Let us use an example to show how emotion can raise the involvement with respect to an offering.
        Let us consider, for example, a celebrity-based brand. Something like Boost. Boost is a milk additive in the
        Indian context. The milk additive is an offering, which when added to milk, provides the taste, provides a few

        nutrients, and makes milk that much more appealing as compared to plain milk. Boost for the last three
        decades has been used celebrities with the caption "Boost is the secret of our energy". When we say our
        energy, it is a celebrity along with a consumer who's portrayed in the ad.

               The boost advertisements initially started with celebrities, specifically sports celebrities drawn from
        the sports domain who said, "Boost is the success of my energy". And today, the topical celebrity says, "Boost
        is the secret of our energy", along with the consumer. When I say topical celebrities, the brand involves the

        celebrity who is actively successful at a particular period in time.
               Let us consider how the involvement levels are raised with respect to this additive called Boost, which

        is a brand. It is a well-known brand.
               There is the concept of Excitation of Transfer Theory, which means when consumers experience an
        involvement with regard to one stimuli, they transfer the same involvement and emotion to another stimuli.

        We have already seen that stimuli is input to any of the sensory organs. So, celebrity is a stimuli, when
        consumers get involved and get emotional with respect to the celebrity, the consumer who essentially is a

        kid who drinks the drink Boost transfers his emotion on to the brand Boost. This is one aspect of involvement
        being raised. The other aspect of involvement is with respect to the motivation and emotion. It has to be noted
        this is a very powerful combination.

               The motivation is the internal drive from that consumer with respect to his involvement and motivation
        propels the consumer into action. Action of searching for a brand and buying a brand. The emotion is the
        feeling, which is also backed up with something known as arousal, and arousal is the state of wakefulness.

        When we say somebody has been aroused, he/she is in the state vaguefulness, she/he's alert.
               So, motivation along with emotion provides a powerful focus for the consumer. So, the emotional
        involvement, the respect to the celebrity and the emotion being transferred on from the celebrity to the brand

        works with the motivation of the individual. To produce enduring involvement as far as the Boost is concerned,
        because the target segment of kids, show an enduring involvement with regard to a sport. Generally, we find

        that consumers as kids who are interested in a particular sport, follow the sport even when they become older
        and that's why I call it as an enduring involvement in this context.

              V. SOCIAL JUDGMENT THEORY



               In order to take decision-making to a deeper level, let us get into one of the theories in our final phase
        of this lesson on decision-making.
               There  may  be  a  number  of  theories  associated  with  decision-making.  One  such  theory  is  social

        judgment theory. To reemphasize, several of these theories enable us to better understand the theoretical
        models  which  are  presented  in  books.  Social  judgment  theory  was  developed  by  Sheriff.  The  theory  is
        extremely useful in terms of conceptualization of the need of the consumer. As I've already mentioned earlier,

        the need want is a very important stage and this theory probably provides a perspective to understand that
        need want aspect in a better manner.

               The basic assumption in this theory is that an individual's position with respect to a belief is based on
        his involvement with respect to an issue. The individual takes a position with respect to his thinking based on
        his involvement on a specific issue. In the domain of consumer behavior, we can consider several aspects

        across  brands  and  possibly  extend  social  judgment  theory  into  the  decision-making  area  of  consumer
        behavior.

               In this example, there is the proposition of facial wash for men. As we have seen in recent times in
        the Filipino context, male grooming is an important part of a man's ritual of grooming. We find creams for
        men. Hair oil for men and several other cosmetic aspects that were the exclusive preserve of women in the

        previous year’s slowly getting opened up for men. We have a couple of brands in the area of facial wash.
        One is Ponds form men and women which is strongly entrenched in the Filipino context. The brand entered
        the Filipino context by its offering for women, and today it has a variant for men.

               Let us take a look at how the category of facial wash for men could be associated with social judgment
        theory.  According to  the  theory,  there's  a  zone  of  acceptance. The  zone  of  acceptance  means  that the
        individual accepts the idea with a high degree of involvement. There is also a zone of rejection where the

        individual rejects a specific idea. It could be a proposition of the brand. It could be philosophy associated with
        the religion and so on and so forth. There is also a zone of non-commitment, which is associated with the

        individual. Of course, there could be several other kinds of variations with respect to the zone of acceptance
        and rejection in shades and degrees. In order to have a good idea about the concept of social judgment
        theory,  as  applied  to  decision-making.  Let  us  consider  the  statement  facial  wash  for  men  is  useful.  An

        individual who believes strongly that facial wash for men is useful belongs to the zone of acceptance and an
        individual who believes that a fairness cream for men is useless, belongs to the zone of rejection.

        Experiential Utility
               Professor Baba Shiv, the well-known researcher, had brought in an insight that will have profound
        implications  on  consumer  decision-making.  That  was  a  time  when  price  leadership  was  getting  popular

        among marketers. Price leadership made that if a brand brings down its price, it can slowly build leadership
        with respect to its domain.

                                                                                                              35]]></page><page Index="43"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                     Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus

               This researcher was curious to know the effectiveness of such an approach because there is a very
        strong connection between price and quality. When consumers perceive price to be on the lower side, they
        would also perceive quality to be that much lower. When Baba Shiv asked marketeers they just told him that

        there would certainly be an impact with respect to the perception of prices among consumers, but that would
        slowly get adjusted as consumers started using the product. In other words, the expected utility from the
        transaction would not have any implications on the experiential utility.

               Researcher, Baba Shiv came out with a very interesting experiment. This is an experiment where
        respondents had to taste different kinds of wines, which were ranging from $5 to $90. Each respondent was
        randomly shown different kinds of prices with respect to the wine, and the respective wine was injected into

        his mouth with a specific mechanism. The responded would be given the wine after the prices were flashed
        so that he could see that. The respondent would have the wine in his mouth for some time and at a later point

        in time, the mouth would be washed off, and again, another type of wine which had a different price tag would
        be fed into the mouth of the respondent. Each respondent was monitored through an MRI scan. This meant
        that the brain waves could be observed as and when the respondent was tasting the wine. It is so turned out

        that the portions of the brain, which were to do with pleasure was flashing more whenever the respondent
        experienced a wine which was priced higher. So, this meant that when the respondent had tasted a wine

        costing $90, those parts of the brains which was associated with the pleasurable zones were flashing much
        more than when it flashed when the respondent was experiencing a wine, which was priced lower.
               The interesting fact is that all the wines tasted by each of the respondents were the one and the same.

        This clearly brought out the fact that the experiential aspect with respect to the wine had profound impact
        with respect to the pleasure perceived by that respondent.

              I. PERCEPTION AND BRANDING


               The inherent aspect of perception is a unique aspect of the individual's world. So, the unique aspect
        of the individual world is something which is associated with the private world of an individual. And perception
        forms the basic input with respect to branding. In fact, we can say that perception anchors branding and what

        makes it special is that perception is selective. This means that if an individual is interested in buying a TV,
        he would look for ads and information only associated with TV or television. If a person, if an individual is

        interested in a magazine, he's going to stay focused and be selective in his perception while he's reading the
        magazine. So, perception is highly selective, and that is the reason the individual is able to probably select
        his stimuli that is of importance to his motivation and needs. Can we imagine a world where an individual is

        bombarded by millions of stimuli and he does not have a selective mechanism? In fact, the selectivity of
        perception provides the focus to the perceptual thoughts of the individual. Without selectivity, the individual

        would find it extremely difficult to perceive anything in this world, and hence form a thought process.






                                                                                                              35]]></page><page Index="46"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                     Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus

               Branding again is a challenge to the marketer because the marketer has to create a unique image
        not only in terms of an individual's mind but in terms of all individuals who are a part of the target segment of
        the brand. Let us take the example of a brand like a Dove soap. So essentially, the core proposition of Dove

        soap is that it contains a high degree of moisturizer. When Dove started advertising itself, it was very clear
        about what kinds of perception it will induce in the mind of the consumer. Unique Selling Proposition of Dove
        clearly brought out the fact the soap has moisturizer and despite the fact that it competes with soaps in the

        soap category, it'll have a unique perception that this is a soap with a significant amount of moisturizer which
        is good for the skin. That gives us an idea about how perception needs to appeal not just to the individual,
        but  to  the  target  segment  of  a  particular  brand  when  a  brand  positions  itself  to  the  relevant  consumer

        segments.
               So, the challenge is to ensure that the personal reality, which is created at the individual, amidst the

        target  segment  is  also equally  felt  with  respect  to  several  individuals  in  the  target  segment. That  is  the
        fundamental challenge with respect to the usage of perception by the marketer.

              II. PERCEPTION AND CULTURE


               Perception also has a cultural aspect to it. Any perception has to take place in the atmosphere of
        culture, in the backdrop of a culture, in the context of a culture and hence cultural symbolism is an important

        aspect of perception.
               Cultural  symbolism  involves  how  a  stimuli  associated  with  certain  symbolic  characteristics  in  the
        culture is used by the marketer. When we talk about the symbolic characteristics with respect to certain

        ingredients  associated  bathing  in  the  Indian  context,  it  could  be  Neem,  it  could  be  Saffron,  it  could  be
        Sandalwood, we see that the Sandalwood, Saffron, and Neem have very specific cultural symbolism, which

        is associated with the beauty aspect of an individual. Hence, we have a number of brands trying to make use
        of the natural ingredients associated with these ingredients when the soap is being positioned.
               Today, there is a back-to-the-nature tendency on the part of consumers in the environment, and we

        see a number of brands associating themselves with the Ayurvedic aspects of functioning when it comes to
        the benefits associated with the specific brand used for a specific purpose. So hence, cultural symbolism

        makes an important aspect of perception.
               When it comes to cultural symbolism that is a symbolism that matters to the respective target segment.
        There could be something like Saffron and Neem, as I had mentioned earlier, that has a mass appeal and

        there could be something like a Fastrack watch from Titan that may not have a mass appeal, but that may
        appeal to a specific target segment based on certain symbolic characteristics that are relevant to that culture.

                                                                                                              36]]></page><page Index="47"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                     Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus

        This could be with respect to the feeling of youth, this could be with respect to the feeling of being trendy, this
        could be with respect to the feeling associated with the rebellious attitude in a culture. Many of these things
        possibly may be associated with the brand Fastrack from Titan.

               So, the marketer needs to be careful to ensure that the cultural symbolism that is associated with the
        brand is relevant to that target segment.
        Influence of Native Country and Culture

               With  respect  to  perception,  let  us  consider  an  excellent  example  of  how  the  country  of  origin  is
        associated  with  the  cultural  context.  The  distinguishing  feature  of  this  example  is  that  this  is  not  even
        associated with a specific consumer marketing strategies.

               This example was given by one of the pioneers of a positioning strategy in a brand summit during the
        year 2006. The backdrop is set in the country of Argentina. The challenge was to market a brand that was at

        the cutting edge of laser technology with respect to bar-coders. How old the brand, which was called as multi-
        scan market itself with the country of origin as Argentina, despite the fact that it was a good product with the
        state-of-the-art technology. This is the challenge.

               In an unbelievable manner, the perceptual field of buyers was changed in the following manner:
               The owner's name was Roberto, hinting at a non-American origin. This was changed as Robert. The

        brand moved its headquarters from Argentina to Florida to become an American brand. These two moves
        ensured that the brand met with a huge success in terms of its export and in terms of its sales within a short
        period of the change. This gives us an idea about the power of perception especially in the backdrop of a

        cultural context and how the change of context had mattered to the target segment of this particular brand.

             III. SENSATION AND ATTENTION


               Moving onto some of the important aspects of perception, there are two aspects which are important:
        sensation and attention.

               Sensation occurs when a stimuli comes within the grasp of sensory organs. The stimuli could be a
        brand, or the stimuli could be a visual image, or the stimuli could be a food product, or the stimuli could be a
        sound. So essentially, when a stimuli is within the grasp of a sensory organ it can be with respect to the grasp

        of ice within the vicinity of the audible range something which an individual can taste, something which an
        individual can touch. So, the point at which it enters the vicinity of a sensory organ sensation takes place.

        Sensation is perhaps the fundamental aspect of sensory branding. Without sensation, there cannot be any
        sensory input and without any sensory input a perception cannot take place.
               The  next  aspect  is  attention.  Attention  occurs when  a  stimuli  is  noticed.  As  you might  or  rightly

        guessed, attention could be voluntary, or attention can be involuntary. A loud sound in a silent room is an
        example  of  an  involuntary  attention-getting  stimuli.  We  have  all  noticed  that  sometimes  the  volume  of

        television can go up when a specific ad comes on the screen. This actually is involuntary attention. It is very
        important to understand that whenever a consumer is interested in some things, selective attention takes
        place and attention to advertisements, attention to product details are voluntary. When the consumer is not

        interested in any specific category or in any specific brand or in any specific marketing aspect, he can still
        probably be attending to several kinds of stimuli generated by marketing. For instance, one may not be
        interested in buying a car at some point in time and still can be probably attend to an ad because of its

        involuntary nature and because of certain kinds of interest level of the individual himself. So, the involvement
        with respect to interest can be situational or it can be enduring. So, which means someone who's interested
        in cars as a general matter of interest can still keep attending to the ads of cars even when he's not purchasing

        a car.

        Impact of Senses on Perception
               The next important aspect is the impact of specific senses with respect to perception. Specific senses

        include sight, sound, smell, touch, and taste. The sensory aspect of branding, as I had stated earlier, starts
        off with sensory aspects. The senses also form an input, and hence an important aspect from the viewpoint

        of branding.
               Let us take for example, sight. Let us take a very common-place example of consumers shopping for
        apparel- a specific colors and vibrant colors probably attract consumers that is with respect to seeing. The

        visual appeal of our product itself can be associated with sight. Let us take the example of a pressure cooker.
        Let us take the example of a mobile. Let us even consider a product like Apple's iPhone, all of them have

        specific features that should appeal to that sense of sight.




                                                                                                              39]]></page><page Index="50"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                     Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus

               When we talk about the sound, we find that very specifically the Indian context consumers prefer
        sounds which are quite loud in its nature. Loud sound is a part of the Indian culture. From the viewpoint of
        branding, sound is extremely important. When we take the example of Titan, Titan has developed a very

        specific, background music that is consistently associated with the brand. It is a western classical music piece
        by Mozart. For several decades, Titan has been using it.
               Smell is an important aspect. Smell can be associated with the aroma of food. It can be associated

        with the fragrance from a perfume. It can be associated even with respect to or the kind of smell one gets
        when he buys a bathroom cleaner. In the Indian context, it is very common to find consumers choosing a
        brand of bathroom cleaner that has a very strong smell. The basic assumption is that the stronger the smell

        the more would be its effectiveness with the respect to the germs.
               In the Filipino context whether we buy jewelry or whether we buy an apparel, whether we buy a car,

        or whether we buy real estate, it is all by the sense of touch. This is just not a cultural aspect associated with
        the  Indian  context.  It  can  be  associated  with  any  context.  How  does  touch  experience  perception  is  a
        important aspect? For example, when we find that a very specific mobile brand has a special design, we

        would like to touch and feel the design and that has an impact on our perception of the brand. So, touch is
        extremely important aspect from the viewpoint of branding.

               Taste is yet another dimension of sensory branding. When we take biscuits like Britannia 50-50, we
        find there's is a blend of different tastes. So, tastes are associated with several kinds of perceptions. When
        we talk about an energy drink, consumers perceive a particular taste. When we talk about a soft drink, which

        is not connected with an energy drink, there is this very specific aspect of perception regarding their taste.
        When we talk about a multinational, like a Nestle introducing Curd into the Indian context, consumers would
        like to know whether the taste is almost on par with the cultural aspect of tastes connected with Curd. When

        a brand of coffee wants to offer instant coffee, the consumers are eager to know whether the taste of coffee
        is associated with the kind of cultural taste of coffee they've been associated for the last several decades.
        For example, if it is South India, consumers prefer filter coffee. Thus, a brand of coffee marketed in South

        India should it have a taste which is very close to filter coffee.
               The point to be noted is that the consumer has a multisensory experience. It is just not one aspect

        and when the consumer buys a brand of biscuit there's a sense of taste, there's a sense of smell, there's a
        sense of a visual appreciation of the package, there's a sense of touch when the consumer just about touches
        the biscuit, making it a multisensory experience. It is for the brand to achieve a competitive edge on its

        proposition with respect to a sense of branding that is associated with a particular brand. So essentially, it is
        the context that decides on how our brand should respond to the challenges of multisensory aspects affecting

        consumers.
               There  are  several  examples  with  respect  to  how  taste  affects  the  perception  of  consumers.  For
        example, today we have health and fitness as a trend. “Anything which is healthy is not tasty” can be a

        perception which is widely spread among the consumers of the Indian context. How should a marketer of a
        healthy brand attend to this kind of perception is a challenge. Similarly, when “anything which is indulgent

                                                                                                              40]]></page><page Index="51"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                     Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus

        and tasty, is not healthy” is a perception, how should a brand, which is into indulgence ensure that the
        unhealthy aspect of the brand does not really mask the perception of a brand? Today, we find a number of
        brands in the health sphere associating themselves with more of baked foods rather than fried foods in an

        attempt to cater to snacking and health where there could be a compromise within taste and health.

              IV. APPLICATION OF PERCEPTION


        Just Noticeable Difference
               This lesson will also discuss certain things which are associated with certain interesting applications

        of perception. Absolute threshold is the point at which a person can experience a sensation. It is extremely
        interesting because it has a practical significance in a country like India. We see several hoardings on the

        board when we are in a busy street in any of the metropolitan cities or even in towns, we see a number of
        hoardings with advertisements. What is the point at which a person can experience a sensation when he
        sees a hoarding that has an ad - has interesting implications on the noticeability and attention given to that

        particular hoarding.
               Just Noticeable Difference or JND is the difference between two stimuli and it is based on the
        relative intensity of first stimulus. JND was advocated by a scientist known as Weber and JND and Weber's

        laws have very interesting applications in marketing. Let me first explain what is JND. For example, let us
        take money as a stimuli. If money is a stimuli, let us examine the category of grocery and the category of
        cars. A car, which is priced at four lakhs wants to raise the prices by about a hundred rupees. This will not

        be a just noticeable difference because the initial stimuli of four lakhs is significantly larger than the raise
        which is noticed. Let us take the case of a consumer shopping for grocery. Let us assume that the consumer

        is shopping for about a hundred rupees and the shopkeeper gives him a discount of two rupees. The two-
        rupee discount will be noticed by the consumer whey they shopping for a hundred rupees because two rupees
        is still a significant aspect of a hundred rupees in the category of shopping for groceries.

               Essentially, the initial stimulus and the final stimulus in both the cases, it is the initial price and the
        modified price with the discounting in the case of grocery, or in the case of raise of prices in the case of car

        is the initial stimulus and the modified stimulus. So higher the initial stimulus higher is the change required in
        the same stimulus for the consumers to notice it. A two rupees increase in grocery will be noticed, but a 200
        rupees raise with respect to the price of a car may not get noticed and that is the implication as far as just

        noticeable difference is concerned.



                                                                                                              41]]></page><page Index="52"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                     Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus

               The interesting aspect of just noticeable difference is that when a brand of chocolate, when a brand
        of detergent, when a brand of coffee, when a brand of grocery wants to reduce the quantity because of price
        rises, the reduction in quantity should not be perceived by the consumer. For example, a brand of detergent

        today, probably sells its weight as 245 grams for a particular price. A couple of years back, the pack was 250
        grams. Now, the reduction of five grams has been accommodated to ensure that there is no price change.
        There is no price change when the brand switched over its packaging from 250 grams to 245 grams. In this

        case, the change with respect to the grammage, which is 5 grams may not be perceived by the consumer.
        This is a typical example of how the marketer is able to adjust the grammage with the references to the price
        increases ingredients without altering the final price of the brand.

               The flip side of the implication with respect to new product development is equally interesting. A
        chocolate  which  wants  to  reposition  and  relaunch  itself  as  milk-based  chocolate  should  ensure  that  the

        relaunched  chocolate  will  be  perceived  as  milk-based  chocolate.  In  this  case,  the  milk-based  chocolate
        should be reflected in the sense of taste. So, as we can infer there are changes that the marketer would not
        want the consumers to perceive and there are changes where the marketer would want the consumers to

        perceive  in  the  context  of  repositioning  and  in  the  context  of  revitalization  and  so  on  and  so  forth.  The
        noticeability associated with the change in the stimulus is quite difficult and complex from the consumer's

        viewpoint as well as for conveying the changes from the marketer's viewpoint. This is known as JND and its
        applications with respect to perceptual aspects of a brand.
        Implications of JND

               Major implications of JND can be seen with respect to management of a product line. In today's
        context, product line is an important aspect of branding. A product line consists of several kinds of offerings
        from the same brand with respect to different types of target segment. For instance, when we take the product

        line of Tea, there can be Taj Mahal catering to one segment, there can be Red Label Three Roses catering
        to another segment, there can be Taajaa Tea catering to a different segment. All the three brands are from
        the same company, Unilever. And the challenge is to ensure they get differentiated with respect to several of

        the marketing mix elements from the viewpoint of the target segment. Some interesting examples can be
        discussed as far as the product line management and JND are concerned.

               Let us take for example a brand from the detergent sector. Surf Excel is a brand. Surf Excel has a bar
        soap as well as a powder detergent offering. So, powder detergent is a different product form as compared
        to the bar soap. Now the challenge for a Surf Excel brand is to ensure that both the powdered form of Surf

        Excel as well as the bar form of Surf Excel appropriately marketed to that target segment with respect to the
        ads, with respect to the unique selling proposition, with respect to several aspects of the two offerings in the

        product line.
               Parachute Hair Oil is a very popular brand in the Indian context, and they have a host of offerings with
        respect to their product line. There is an offering called Parachute Jasmine which is associated with the

        Jasmine fragrance that's popular in several parts of the country. That is basic of Parachute Coconut Oil which
        talks about the goodness of the coconut oil and there are other variants of Parachute oil that are concerned

                                                                                                              42]]></page><page Index="53"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                     Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus

        with the herbal offerings, whether it is a hair oil or whether it is watches, or whether it is apparel, it is extremely
        important for marketers to ensure that there are very specific differences between several aspects of the
        product line, which are marketed to different kinds of consumer groups or target segments.

               In  certain  categories,  it  becomes  extremely  complex  and  difficult  for  the  brand  to  achieve  the
        differentiation which we are talking about in the context of JND. For instance, let us take the case of the
        mobile category in the Indian context. When we take Samsung mobile, when we take on another brand of

        mobile, there are extensive price points. The price points are very tightly provided in the product line and
        each product offering is concerned with the price point. The challenge for the marketer is to ensure that
        consumers differentiate across these price points and the challenge doesn't end there. That marketer has to

        also ensure that the product line as a whole results in profitability.
               So, consumer perception which is shaped by JND is responsible for differentiation. And eventually, it

        is also responsible on how well the marketer is able to make use of it with respect to the profitability associated
        with the brand. Product line management is one of the most useful applications of perception very specifically,
        the just noticeable different aspects of perception.

              V. ATTRIBUTES OF PERCEPTION


        Intrinsic and Extrinsic Attributes
               The lesson will discuss the difference between intrinsic and extrinsic attributes and their implications
        on perception.

               Intrinsic attributes are those that are inherent in the product or brand itself. For example, the color of
        a brand, the taste of a brand, the ingredients of a brand. These are all very, very intrinsic to the brand because
        they add to the characteristic of the brand. The inherent aspects or characteristics of the brand is modified

        by the intrinsic aspects of the brand. The extrinsic attributes of the brand also influence the brand, also
        influence the characteristics of brand, but they are not a part of the inherent part of the brand or the offering.

               For example, branding is an extrinsic attribute, packaging is an extrinsic attribute. So, anything that
        adds to the intrinsic aspects of the brand as experienced by the company will form the intrinsic cue and
        anything that is associated with the extrinsic aspects are those aspects that are not an inherent part of the

        brand are extrinsic aspects of the brand or the product. For example, foreign-sounding brand names are
        extrinsic cues. Let us take the example of Park Avenue in the Indian context, Park Avenue is the brand of an

        Indian apparel offering. Essentially, Park Avenue triggers associations of America, associations of fashion,
        associations of the formal aspects of New York and so on and so forth. It is an extrinsic aspect.
               When we talk about an intrinsic aspect of a brand, let us talk about Cadbury Silk for example. Silk has

        got certain intrinsic aspects that adds to the sensory taste of Cadbury. It could be the smooth texture of the
        chocolate, the chocolate flavor, the color, etc. which are innate to the product. When we talk about herbal
        shampoos, some of the herbal shampoo brands contain herbs that could be seen by the consumer. They

        form the intrinsic aspect of the brand. A combination of extrinsic and intrinsic aspects of the brand, influence
        the brand, and hence influence the perception of branding. So extrinsic and intrinsic aspects of a brand, are
        yet another dimension of perception that is useful to branding.

        Perceptual Organization
               This  discuss  another  interesting  aspect  of  perception,  which  is  associated  with  perceptual

        organization. How are stimuli organized together and how does perception happen with respect to thought
        with  respect  to  a  collection  of  thoughts  with  respect  to  a  brand.  There  are  few  aspects  of  perceptual
        organizations that is important for a marketer from the viewpoint of branding. One is for figure and ground.

        The second one is grouping. Third one is closure. And the fourth one is Interpretation.
               All aspects of perceptual organization lend themselves amenable to creativity  with respect of the
        brand, but creativity needs to be implemented within a specific context. When I say specific context, it is

        associated with the competitive context, it is associated with competitive brands, it is associated with the
        target segment, it is associated with the number of aspects concerned with the stimuli with the respect to the
        background in which the stimuli takes shape because the backdrop is something which is very important from

        the viewpoint of interpreting a stimuli.


                                                                                                              45]]></page><page Index="56"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                     Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus

        Figure and Ground
               This discuss each of these aspects of perceptual organization. Let us take, for example, figure and
        ground. Let us consider an advertisement, print advertisement, it could be any kind of advertisement, it could

        be any kind of message for purpose of simplicity, let us take an advertisement. The figure is something which
        is solid, which is concrete, and which is in the forefront, and something which gets contrasted from the ground.
        The ground is hazy. It isn't the backdrop and it gets contrasted from the figure. When you see a picture, it

        could be an art, it could be a photograph, it could be any image, not necessarily an advertisement, the figure
        is the basic image that has our focus. For example, when we are looking at the photograph of a group of
        people, the group of people form the figure, the background with respect to the photograph, the background

        could be a natural scenery, the background could be a screen, the background could be a building, the
        background could be anything, the background gets contrasted from the group of people. So, this is the

        concept of figure and ground.
               The implications are figure and ground with respect to advertisements today whether it is digital or
        otherwise  is  obvious  from  the  viewpoint  of  marketing,  the  message  to  be  conveyed.  The  unique  selling

        proposition of a brand needs to be the figure and the creativity, the music, the jingle, the backdrop, should
        be the ground. If the creativity is of a high order to such an extent that it overshadows the figure, the brand,

        and its proposition would be completely lost. When it is lost, the consumer does not get hold of the message.
        The consumer does not get hold of what the brand stands for. And the entire creativity is remembered by the
        consumer, but the recall and recognition with respect to various aspects of the brand are completely missing

        and advertising or promotion becomes a wasteful effort.
               If we discuss some examples of advertising, it would be clear. Let us take the example of a baby
        product.  Most  of  the  baby  products  like  baby  soap,  baby  oil,  baby  talcum  powder  are  predominantly

        associated with the associations of mother and baby. The mother and baby in most cultures stand for warmth,
        affection, unconditional binding, so on and so forth. They add meaning to whatever has been synced. In the
        process of making warmth and affection and several other aspects of emotion, if the brand tries to provide

        creativity at the cost of the brand name or at the cost of the message or the unique selling proposition of the
        brand, then the figure gets eclipsed by the ground. So very clearly, the creativity part of the ad should be the

        background and essentially the figure should be a unique selling proposition or something which is extremely
        important connected with the brand. Figure and ground from the core aspects of the brand's message.
        Grouping

               Grouping involves grouping different kinds of associations to ensure the brand's associations are well-
        formed in the minds of the consumer. There could be a brand of soap which is lemony in nature, the stimuli

        used in the ads and stimuli used by the brand should be grouped in such a way that the lemony brand of
        soap stands for a refreshing aspect of the soap. It should ensure that the consumer is able to experience
        some aspects of getting himself or herself refreshed when she or he looks at the brand or the packaging or

        the advertisement of the brand. The grouping could also be with respect to the backdrop. For example, coffee
        and tension-filled lifestyle is being grouped. Over a period of time, coffee to stimulate thinking in a corporate

                                                                                                              46]]></page><page Index="57"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                     Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus

        environment to coffee as a part of the lifestyle is getting grouped. So, the challenge for the marketer is to
        ensure what kinds of associations would be suitable to ensure that appropriate grouping takes place so that
        the brand's associations are distinct in the mind of the consumer.

               An interesting example is the case of Liberty footwear. (It is the effectiveness of the example that
        matters more than the contemporariness of the example. While the contemporariness of the example makes
        you get in touch with the environmental trends, the essence of the example and the conceptual aspects of

        the example are equally important. Hence, we take this case of Liberty footwear from several years ago.)
               Many years ago, Liberty footwear came out with an interesting advertisement when the leading brands
        in the environment were doing badly. That was an opportunity for Liberty to establish itself. Liberty wanted to

        convey the proposition that it is a fashionable and modern brand. Hence, it came out with an advertisement
        that featured fashionable cooling glass or goggles, a trendy American fast food and coca cola present in the

        ad. So eventually, it was able to effectively convey the message that Liberty as a brand is on par with the
        cutting-edge fashion as desired by a modern young consumer. By presenting itself in the group that contained
        the representative products of modern American lifestyle, Liberty managed to carve its identity as a modern

        lifestyle brand in the footwear category.
        Closure

               What exactly is closure? Closure in simple terms is the tendency with respect to the individual to
        involuntarily complete stimuli if a part of the stimuli is sensed by him. Please note the important aspects of
        closure. Tendency arises from the individual. The individual attempts to complete a stimuli, which is well

        known to him, which is well-rehearsed by him over a period of time and that happens involuntarily. He simply
        involuntarily completes it.
               Typical example in a non-marketing complex could be remembering our name. If the name is Barack

        Obama for example. Every time somebody hears Barack, there will be a tendency to complete it as Barack
        Obama. The same concept could be extended to your brand. A popular brand like Kellogg, which is very
        popular with the consumers, and this is a brand that could automatically generate associations. And more

        importantly, the consumer is extremely familiar with the brand over a period of time.
               Let us imagine a consumer being presented with the brand name Kellogg's, which is cut into half in

        the print medium. There's an advertisement of Kellogg's where upper end of the brand is very clearly defined,
        but the lower end of the brand is not clearly defined in terms of its individual letters. The K is a letter, E is a
        letter, L is a letter. All those things are good enough to be perceived, but essentially, the lower part of the

        letters are missing that is closure. The consumer, as soon as he sees the name Kellogg, he will have a
        tendency to complete it. The same way, when a consumer here's a popular jingle or background music of a

        brand, for example, for a very long time, Lifebuoy as a brand of soap had a cinema commercial, which was
        shown in the cinema halls in its ads, it is a very catchy jingle was accompanied by a visual. So, over a period
        of time, the consumer gets used to the jingle and the ad, and every time he hears the jingle even without the

        visual, he would be reminded of the visual. So, this is a very powerful part of perception. And it is a, not as
        much used as grouping, but depending on the context the brand could find used to it.

                                                                                                              47]]></page><page Index="58"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY

        Interpretation
               Interpretation  is  another  aspect  of  perceptual  organization.  How  do  we  interpret  the  stimuli?
        Essentially, a brand needs to ensure that the consumer knows the category with which it competes, and

        about how it differentiates itself.
               A typical example could be a case of Red Bull. Red Bull, in fact, competes with soft drinks. The
        consumer knows that the Red Bull competes in the category of soft drinks, but it is a very specialized energy

        drink. So, from the viewpoint of Red Bull, the brand has to ensure that the consumer knows the category with
        which it competes and the consumer also at the same time knows the differentiation to appreciate that Red
        Bull is a subcategory in the category of soft drinks. This is a typical example of interpretation.

               There could be many ways to ensure the brand is interpreted correctly. If, for example, Yogurt is
        introduced in the Indian context. Yogurt is very similar to your curd, but curd is the popular aspect of the

        Indian culture. So, if a company wants to introduce Yogurt, it needs to ensure consumers differentiated it
        adequately from Curd. So, it may be probably be perceived in the category of curd, but how was Yogurt
        differentiated from curd is the challenge for the marketer. So, that brings us to a close on the discussion of

        perceptual organization.
        Conclusion

               This lesson will be completed by highlighting certain applications that would have a strategic impact
        with respect to the brand. In today's competitive world where digitalization is also included, it is essential for
        a brand to appreciate three aspects as important implications with respect to perception and branding.

               The  first  aspect  is  brand  positioning.  How  does  a  brand  position  itself  completely  is  based  on
        perceptual aspects? Second aspect, after a brand positions itself, it has to sustain itself in a competitive field
        which is changing in an extremely fast and radical manner. Hence, re-positioning exercises are required.

        When we study brands either in the Indian context or in a global context, we find that most of the leading
        brands  repositioned  themselves.  Repositioning  involves  modifying  the  perceptual  field  of  the  consumer
        depending on the context in which it is undergoing certain changes. Today, there may be more of youngsters

        coming into the market, billionaires coming into the market, there could be more of digitalization, there could
        be more of associations with respect to competitive brands. So, repositioning involves creating a perceptual

        field to the extent of modifying the existing perceptual field associated with original positioning.
               The third question is equally important. When we talk about modifying the perceptual field between
        the  original  positioning and  the  relaunched  positioning  or the repositioning.  How  should  associations  be

        handled? One aspect to be noted is that perception should always cater to consistent associations among
        the consumers and over a period of time, how are these consistent associations going to be stable in the

        mind of the consumer despite the changes in the environment is a challenge to the marketers. So, striking a
        delicate balance between changing associations as per the situation, and retaining the original associations
        of the brand is the challenge for the marketer as far as perception is concerned.

               Students will select three brands from a category that existed ten years back in marketing

        context. Compare its intrinsic and extrinsic attributes used 10 years ago with its intrinsic and extrinsic

        attributes of the same brands in today’s context and make observations with respect to the changes
        in its attributes.

                                            CONSUMER LEARNING




                Instructional Objectives


               Lesson 5 covers the WEEK 13 - 14 of the course syllabus. After the completion of the lesson,
               students will be able to:
               1.  Determine the importance of learning in the context of branding and consumer behavior.

               2.  Examine the several ways in which a consumer would learn about a brand of a product.
               3.  Discuss the importance of classical conditioning in studying brands and association from the
                   viewpoint of learning.





             I. CONSUMER LEARNING: TYPES AND IMPORTANCE


        Importance of Learning
               As consumers, we keep learning day in and day out and the learning happens spontaneously. Let us

        think about ourselves. Are we using the same kind of cosmetics that we use 10 years back? How is it that
        we have changed? Let us take probably diverse sets of examples from product categories. It could be what
        is known as a vacuumizer, which is completely a new product altogether. It could be iPhone, or it could be

        something like a biscuit. One can easily find out that the kind of learning that occurs with respect to consumers
        when we talk about these diverse products varies from one consumer to another, and more importantly, it

        also varies with respect to the category itself.
               Let us take the case of vacuumizer. What is vacuumizer? A vacuumizer was introduced about 20
        years back when consumer lifestyles were changing in urban cities. A vacuumizer was essentially a pump

        that was used to create vacuum with respect to preservation of wine and very innovatively the marketeer
        thought that it will work in the Indian context. It is even more interesting to note the application of vacuumizer

        in the Indian context. A vacuumizer was used to create a vacuum within a container in which food can be
        preserved. Indians typically preserve food in the refrigerators and a vacuumizer has the added advantage
        that if food is preserved in the vacuumizer it does not give rise to rancidity. Rancidity is one of the major

        problems associated with food storage. This is especially true when it comes to cooked food. Rancidity alters
        the taste, alters the complexion of the food which is stored inside the refrigerator.



                                                                                                              47]]></page><page Index="62"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                     Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus

               The brand initially came out with new kind of distribution known as the sales party plan. This had one
        specific consumer demonstrate the product among his neighborhood and other consumers would probably
        pick up the product if they were impressed with it. When this was not working, the company decided to sell it

        through the conventional distribution route. The company took the extra precaution of trying to advertise the
        product in several kinds of media vehicles. It was there on television. It was there on newspapers. It was
        there on a variety of media. Despite these efforts, the question is, did the product succeed? So, the first

        message for the marketeer is that the marketeer would be interested in imparting learning to the consumer
        in a certain manner, but the consumer may not really be receptive to this kind of learning.
               Let us take the case of biscuits. Biscuit is a commonplace product. All of us know that, people from

        different kinds of age groups enjoy it and there are a variety of well-known brands in the Indian context. One
        can easily see that the involvement associated with learning associated with biscuits is very different from

        that which was associated with vacuumizer. There are differences with respect to products, differences with
        respect to usage, and differences with respect to how different sets of consumers from different segments
        even perceive it.

               Let us take the case of iPad or iPod or iPhone. The receptivity among consumers is so strong that
        consumers not only buy these products, many consumers learn how to use them and the diffusion or the

        spread of these products is almost revolutionary. The question is how did consumers learn with respect to
        iPhone and how did they not learn or were reluctant to learn when it came to vacuumizer. And in between,
        there is some learning that is going on with respect to these kids.

               Learning therefore, explores a number of aspects associated with how consumers learn. There are
        three things important from the viewpoint of learning. One, the consumer must have the motivation to learn.
        It has to come from within. The second point is that the marketeer has to ensure that whatever he says about

        his offering or the offering itself has to be in line with the consumer's motivation. And that's not the end of the
        story. The marketeer will have to ensure that the learning he imparts, or the company imparts is superior to
        the learning imparted by the competitors. So, these three basic aspects of learning are to be borne in mind

        before we go further into learning concepts.
        What is Learning?

               Learning is a process that evolves from changes as consumers acquire knowledge from experience
        and observations and interactions with others. There are several important aspects of this definition.
               First thing is it is a process, which also means that it is continuous. A consumer learns about products,

        services, circumstances, situations, categories, almost throughout his life. This can be any type of consumer.
        This can be a consumer who is struggling to make both ends meet, or it could be a consumer who is very

        rich and has a lot of discretionary income.
               Second aspect is that learning is dynamic. That was the reason why I asked you, do we use the same
        kind of cosmetics that we were using 10 years back?

               Third aspect is that there is knowledge, knowledge from experience, observations, and interactions
        with  others.  Essentially,  we  are  not  learning  in isolation. We are  learning  through  social  media. We  are

                                                                                                              48]]></page><page Index="63"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                     Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus

        learning through advertising. We are learning through our friends. There is constant interaction with others.
        There is also observation with respect to others and we have our own experiences.
               So, the impregnated definition has a lot of messages are as the learning definition is concerned. Now,

        Let us take a look at what are the basics of learning. We have already talked about what a stimulus is all
        about. A stimulus is any input, any of the sensory organs and the response is all about from the consumer
        set. So, a stimulus could be from the marketeer, it could be from the environment, it could be from anywhere,

        and it could be anything. It could be a brand, a product, category person, et cetera. And the response is the
        way one responds to the stimuli.
               This SR relationship (S is the Stimulus, R is the response) is the fundamental platform on which the

        behavioral theories of learning are based. If stimulus-response is not there, there is no learning that takes
        place.

        Behavioral Learning
               These  are  the  basic  aspects  of  behavioral  learning.  There  are  four  things  to  be  noted  as  far  as
        behavioral learning is concerned: motives, cues, response, and reinforcement.

               Motive is from within the consumer as I had already said, the consumer should feel like learning.
               In this context, cues come from the environment. The cue could be an advertisement from a brand.

        The cue could be probably our discussion from a friend. A cue could be a picture from the social media. A
        cue could be from the point of purchase at the shop.
               Response is the response of the consumer.

               And  reinforcement  is  the  most  important  aspect  of  stimulus-response  relationship  because
        reinforcement actually leads to brand loyalty. Reinforcement of the stimulus-response done with commitment
        from the consumer's end, and it leads to brand loyalty.

               For example, let us talk about the motive to buy a car. The consumer goes around searching for
        information. There are a lot of cues from the environment. So, the motive is to buy a car. The motive can
        depend on fuel saving. The motive can depend on safety. The motive can depend on a status. The motive

        can depend on family fun. It could be a combination of these factors. This essentially motivates a consumer
        to move towards a brand.

               The cues, of course, the advertisements from various kinds of brands. The consumer eventually, after
        discussion with his friends, after considering his own resources after probably taking note of his memory
        response, he responds by going to the point of purchase at the shop and he selects a particular brand. The

        particular brand, over a period of time, gives him the experience, gives him some indication of how the
        motives have been fulfilled and eventually, he or she may start liking the brand. This is where SR relationships

        take shape. Once it take shape, he gets used to the particular brand and that results in loyalty.
               It is very interesting to observe that Nokia was a tremendous success in the mobile industry before it
        decided to discontinue itself. It was brought back into the market in an updated manner, it received positive

        response from the consumers. This shows how motive, cues, response, and reinforcement function and in



                                                                                                              49]]></page><page Index="64"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                     Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus

        the case of Nokia, the consumer liking was so high that the company decided to bring back the brand. So,
        this forms the basic introduction to learning.
        Stimulus – Response Relationship

               Before going into the types of learning, you need to have an idea about the importance of stimulus-
        response aspects to brands. These are all classical ways of dealing with brands. Brands are the front office
        which is visible to consumers, and consumer behavior with its classical underpinnings form the back office

        and  stimulus-response  is  one  of  the  most  powerful  ways  to  understand  brand  repositioning,  brand
        revitalization, and how a brand gets itself updated depending on the changes in environment.
               Stimulus-responses associated with two important aspects. The first aspect is the association. Mere

        association of the stimulus-response seems to make an impressionable point in the mind of the consumer.
        The second aspect is what is known as extinction.

               The first aspect association can lead to forgetting. The second aspect extinction deals with rewards.
        Rewards are what the consumer receives from the brand. Associations can lead to the consumer forgetting
        the associations. Extinction happens when the reward from the brand stops and the consumers no longer

        receives the same kind of reward, which he or she was receiving probably before the environment changed.
               Let me explain this with respect to a few examples. Let us take the case of iPod. The iPod is essentially

        a mechanism with which songs can be stored. At the time when iPod was launched or before the time when
        iPod was launched, there was a CD player. There were certain illegal online portals like Napster, which
        people were using to download their songs. Computers also had a CD playback facility. Let us take the case

        of how iPod emphasized a specific habit by offering several kinds of advantages over the existing product
        categories.
               The Napster was a legal website and it was closed. The conventional CD player was good enough,

        but the only problem is that when the consumer was forced to buy a CD, it would have a number of songs
        and some of the songs he may not like. There is no option for the consumers to record something completely
        based on his choice and play it back. iPod was ideal and in association with its collaborator, iTunes from

        Sony, it literally wrote history. This gives us an idea about how the extinction is brought about by changes in
        the environment. The CD became obsolete almost overnight with iPod doing the job and at a later point in

        time, MP3 appearing on the scene.
               So, the message number one, as far as stimulus-response is concerned, is that the brand should stay
        itself updated in terms of what it offers. It could be product development, it could be launching new features,

        it  could  be  a  technological  development,  it  could  be  anything.  The  point  is  that  the  stimulus-response
        relationships should ensure that extinction does not take place.

               The second case happens when stimulus-response is forgotten. In the sense, the product may be
        good enough. But the consumer over a period of time forgets about the product because the visibility with
        respect to the stimulus or the brand is no longer there. This is one of the reasons why well-known brands

        keep advertising throughout the year. The whole idea is to ensure that they are there on the top of the mind
        recall as far as the consumer segments are concerned.

                                                                                                              50]]></page><page Index="65"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY

               Eno was a product used for relieving oneself of intestinal gas and the brand is about 50 years old.
        Over  a  period  of time  with market  slowly  changing  in terms  of  customer  lifestyle  several  other  products
        appearing for the control of intestinal gas Eno had to come back with an advertising campaign that talked

        about how well it compares with seven other alternatives, which were available on the market.
               This is an example to show how not only the product is superior, the brand has to be in the mind of
        the consumer. If the brand doesn't advertise, if the brand is not spoken about on the social media, if the brand

        doesn't reinforce its associations in tune with what is happening with respect to consumers' life, the brand is
        likely to be forgotten.
               It may be a good point to observe the Bru coffee brand which started itself as a filter coffee offering

        slowly talked about the kind of relationships that exist between a husband and wife or romantic relationships,
        thereby, making it relevant to the consumer lifestyles and also ensuring that the product offering gets updated

        in the form of reformulation. This would have given you some idea about the importance of stimulus-response
        relationships and their impact with respect to branding.
        Types of Learning

               These  briefly  explain  the  different  kinds  of  learning  that  could  happen  from  the  viewpoint  of  the
        consumer mindset. These are kinds of learning that were advocated by psychologists long back, and they

        still hold good in the digital age.
               Let me start with Classical Conditioning as a learning theory. It will explain more  deeply about
        classical conditioning subsequently in this lesson, but for the time being, it is learning by associations. When

        we think of the British brand, Yardley, we think of English associations, we think of the British queen, we think
        about several classical things that are associated with Yardley. The question is from where we did we get
        these associations? When we think of BMW brand of car, several associations come to our mind. It’s German.

        It's the ultimate driving machine. It signals the status yet a sporty fee; it is sexy. The motorcycle of BMW was
        used in the James Bond movie. Where do these associations come from?
               Essentially, consumer learns through associations, and that is to do with classical conditioning. Let

        us go into operant or instrumental conditioning. Essentially, operant or instrumental conditioning is all
        about learning by rewards. A simple example in the Indian context would be the petrol bunks which are

        located in several parts of the city. There could be about five, six petrol bunks in a particular road or that
        could be about two petrol bunks or there could be about five, six petrol bunks within a given vicinity. Imagine
        a petrol bunk where the car or motorcycle is welcomed by the service personnel in a highly receptive manner.

        It could be small things like wiping off the dust from the car. It could be two people running to attend on the
        consumer. It  could  be  somebody  helping the  consumer  with  opening  the  petrol  tank.  Compare this  with

        another petrol bunk where the service is indifferent. The car goes and stops there. Nobody is worried about
        it. You wait for some time, call out to people, you need to be very careful about how they handle your patrol
        cap. That tells you a lot about instrumental conditioning. It could be with respect to the petrol bunk, it could

        be with respect to your brand of tea, it could be with respect to even an airline. There are several airline
        brands, which are operating in the country. Many consumers are particular about a specific Airline brand,

                                                                                                              51]]></page><page Index="66"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                     Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus

        why? Because they feel the airline handles the flights on time. They feel the airline is courteous, the airline
        does many things which are positive when the customer wanted to take the flight. This is known as apparent
        conditioning.

               Cognitive learning presumes that the consumer doesn't learn by association. He/she does not learn
        by robot, but he learns through his approaches towards problem-solving. Very interestingly, problem-solving
        can happen with respect to several of our everyday needs and wants. We may get into problem-solving mode

        when we want to buy a new pair of shoes or when we want to buy a new mobile phone. So essentially, this
        presumes that the consumer looks for information in the environment and tries to solve the problems that are
        associated with his needs and wants. Problem in the sense of selecting an offering that will fit into his needs,

        that's what his problem all about or it could be the problem of a mobile phone breaking down and opting for
        a new one and in the process, the consumer tries to have a problem-solving approach.

               For example, urban youngster presuming that he/she was able to afford to buy a higher-priced mobile
        would want to look at several features and trying to signal the status can only be one of them. He may be
        interested in the Bluetooth interface. He may be interested in the video streaming. He may be interested in

        knowing to what extent it can hold onto the apps. He may be interested in knowing how screen-friendly the
        mobile is, he may be interested in how quickly the service problems could be solved. So, as you can see,

        cognitive learning is associated with the problem-solving approach.

             II. CLASSICAL CONDITIONING THEORY OF LEARNING

               Given the importance of classical conditioning in terms of associations with brands. I thought I will

        elaborate  this  theory  so  that  you  would  know  how  this  is  applied  to  brands.  This  is  a  very  interesting
        phenomenon because what you think about one relationship is applied to another relationship. I use the word

        phenomenon because though the theory is well explained by Pavlov, it becomes important to understand
        that the transfer of emotions, the transfer association is something which happens in the mind, and it may be
        very difficult to provide an in-depth aspect about why something appeals to somebody the way it appeals.

               Classical conditioning is extremely relevant today. Not only because it is used in advertisements, but
        it can also have an impact with respect to social media. For instance, when you read about a description of

        a brand or a service or an occasion written by your friend on the social media, impressions and associations
        start forming in your mind.
               Let me start with a few examples. Puppies and warmth. When we take a look at puppies, we find

        them to be likable and there is some degree of warmth with respect to most of us when we see a puppy. This
        probably holds good throughout the universe. After the onset of cafes like Starbucks and Cafe Coffee Day,

                                                                                                              52]]></page><page Index="67"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                     Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus

        and different kinds of cafes, we find that there is a very strong association between friends, fun, and coffee.
        How did this suddenly come into the picture is a question. From a different domain, Let us take the case of
        Rolex watch and prestige. Rolex watch symbolizes prestige. It is worn by successful people, it is a Swiss

        watch, it is classic in terms of its timelessness, and where did we learn these associations? How did we learn
        these associations is the crux of the theory associated with classical conditioning?
               Let me explain the process in which associations are formed. As it was explained by Pavlov. There is

        something  known  as  the  unconditional  stimuli.  Unconditional  stimuli  elicit  some  unconditional  response.
        Going back to the example, puppy is an unconditional stimulus. Warmth is an unconditional response. It is
        important to note that the response is spontaneous. You don't think about the warmth, whether you want to

        love the puppies and then decide to have warmth- it is just spontaneous. Now, we are talking about the brand
        of watch called Rolex and its association with prestige. You can very clearly see that when I talked about

        puppies and coffee, I'm not talking about brands when I'm talking about Rolex, it's just not the premium watch
        that is associated with the prestige word. It's a specific brand of watch that is associated with prestige. Now,
        the process will explain to us how such associations come into the picture in the consumer's mind.

               For example, the mother-child relationship is an unconditional stimulus. Mother-child relationship is
        important throughout the world, whether one is educated or not, whether one is rich or not, regardless of

        where one lives, mother-child relationship is something that is associated with warmth, affection, feelings,
        and this is not true of only the human race, it is true of almost all kinds of species which live in this world. So,
        that's an unconditional response. The feeling of warmth, the feeling of affection, the feeling of likability, the

        feeling of bonding is an unconditional response.
               Now, let us take the case of a baby food. It could be any brand. It could be a multinational brand. It
        could be an Indian brand. It could be an ethnic brand. The brand is the conditional stimuli. The conditional

        stimuli need to be paired with unconditional stimuli. The brand of the baby food needs to be associated with
        the  association  of  mother  and  baby.  We  already  noted  that  the  unconditional  stimuli  give  rise  to  the
        unconditional  response.  The  mother-baby  warmth  gives  rise  to  the  spontaneous  feeling  when  there  is

        repeated  pairing  of  the  baby  food  brand  with  mother-child  relationships.  Conditional  response  happens
        through the unconditional response, which means that the brand has received the associations that were

        associated with mother and child. Over a period of time, psychologically, the consumer connects the brand
        of baby food with very, very warm relationships of mother and child. Now one can imagine why the mother
        probably the specific brand of baby food again and again. We do understand that the baby food is also

        effective in terms of its performance, in terms of its benefits, but at the same time, the associations get
        created.

        Classical Conditioning
               There are a few other important points associated with classical conditioning. For example, when a
        celebrity is introduced, we can talk about celebrities like Shah Rukh Khan and Amitabh Bachchan in the

        Indian context. They have modelled for a variety of brands. They continue to model for a variety of brands,
        and their endorsement of brands has been probably more than two decades. When we talk about a celebrity

                                                                                                              53]]></page><page Index="68"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                     Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus

        getting associated with a brand. For example, Amitabh Bachchan being associated with the brand of scooter
        called  Jupiter.  The  celebrity  conveys,  the  likability  conveys,  trustworthiness  conveys  the  grace  to  the
        consumer, and the brand, in turn, receives the qualities and characteristics of the celebrity. Over a period of

        time, the celebrity gets strongly associated with the brand. Probably India is one market that uses diverse
        kinds of celebrities and diverse kinds of product categories and several multinational brands have started
        using celebrities.

               The important message which needs to be noted is that the unconditional stimuli should have a strong
        connect with culture. Cricket celebrities and film celebrities are part of Indian culture. There is no logic which
        goes into the picture. One logic is that the celebrity maybe an expert with respect to the category which he

        or she is endorsing. For example, when Anne Curtis endorses a brand of cosmetics, she's probably presumed
        or  perceived  to  know  everything  about  the  cosmetic  because  she's  in  the  business  of  beauty,  which  is

        associated with filmdom. But apart from this logic, there is likability, there is trustworthiness, there are several
        other psychological factors which get transferred to the brand. Even a German brand like Nivea has started
        using celebrities in the Indian context. The cultural connect with respect to celebrity is important.

               The second aspect to be noted is that unconditional stimuli which is used along with the conditional
        stimuli which is the brand should not take away too much of attention to the extent of the brand being viewed

        as a background stimuli. One can see the delicate balance which is required with respect to the associations.
        The unconditional aspect of the stimuli should have a rub off on the brand. At the same time, the brand image
        should get registered with respect to the consumer's mind. So, there is a delicate balance that is required

        between the usage of the celebrity and the extent to which the brand is at the forefront of the consumer
        psyche.
               Now, you will be able to appreciate the job of the brand manager, which is to ensure the brand's

        proposition and the brand name does not get relegated to the backdrop because of very strong unconditional
        stimuli used. The unconditional stimuli may be a celebrity, maybe a natural scenery, maybe something which
        is of interest to the consumer, may be of intense intensity in terms of what it can evoke. It can evoke a

        pleasant emotion. It can evoke a good feeling regardless of the characteristic of the unconditional stimuli.
        The marketer has to ensure that there's a proper balance with respect to the conditional stimuli and the

        unconditional stimuli that ensures the brand is always at the forefront.
               This challenge is even more important when a brand starts revitalizing and repositioning itself. Let us
        take the case of Lifebuoy. Lifebuoy is a brand which is more than five decades in the Indian context. Over a

        period of time, Lifebuoy which stands for germ-killing action has added a number of associations has modified
        a number of associations. It advertises on the television, it advertises on social media, it advertises for a

        variety of occasions, but one can see that there is a very strong focus with respect to the classical conditioning
        with respect to the focus on the brand’s proposition. The associations are so managed that the brand's unique
        selling proposition is not compromised at all.

                  For  better  understanding,  try  to  watch  the  videos  about  classical  conditioning  and  theory  of  learning

              III. APPLICATIONS OF CLASSICAL CONDITIONING




        Application of Classical Conditioning – Part 1
               After the discussion about creating associations and the mechanism of the creation of associations,
        let us move on to certain important and interesting applications of classical conditioning. They are not only

        interesting they are challenging as well for the brand manager. I'll try to relate the application of classical
        conditioning to the extent possible to the real world by providing an example. One of the important points to
        be noted with respect to learning of associations is that there are a number of concepts which are intertwined

        together. These are not concepts that can be used sequentially. These are not concepts that can be used in
        a linear manner. These are not concepts that can be used with respect to a question and an answer. These

        are concepts that are holistic in nature, and they need to be used in conjunction with one another depending
        on the situation and depending on the context.
               Let us start with our developing associations which has to do with the strengths of associations. When

        we talk about the strengths of associations, we need to make a reference to what is known as the schema.
        When we make a reference to schema, we need to talk about nodes, which are a part of the schema. We

        need to also talk about the consumer's psyche of encoding. We need to talk about brand imprinting as well.
        So, please note, consumer mind is involved, the brand's association is involved. A set of associations called
        as schema is involved. In between the set of associations there are information nodes which are stored in

        the mind known as nodes. They are involved. Four or five aspects are involved when we talk about how
        associations are deepened or strengthened and how associations can be managed by a brand.
               It is to be noted that today's brand is not a single entity in terms of its offering. The brand manages a

        product line. The product line can consist of several variants of the brand. The product line consists of several
        sub-brands.  So,  from  the  viewpoint  of  creating  associations,  and  from  the  viewpoint  of  sustaining
        associations, a brand manager has to be sensitive to the fact that associations need to be created. They

        need to be strengthened, modified, and adapted to sub-brands. They need to be updated over a period of
        time, and they need to appeal to specific respective target segments. So, one can see the type of challenges

        that associations offer in terms of connecting the brand with the consumer.
               Let us just take the example of Colgate. Colgate is a multinational brand which is almost in every
        household or which is well-known among several households. Colgate has been in the country for several

        decades. The very mention of the Colgate brand sets off associations of trust, associations  of oral care,
        associations of gum care, associations of the doctor in a white coat, associations of children using it, even at

        random we are able to get all of several associations. How are these associations managed by the brand or
        how can they be managed? What are the lessons to be learned from the brand? These are some of the
        things which we can discuss with the help of a few concepts.

               One  is  the  schema.  Schema  is  a  set  of  associations  associated  with  the  specific  domain,  the
        consumer's mind or the individual's mind is so functioning that he carries sets of associations with respect to

                                                                                                              56]]></page><page Index="71"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                     Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus

        different domains in his life. It could be with respect to your brand, it could be with respect to a product
        category, it could be with respect to religion, it could be with respect to education, it could be with respect to
        politics, it could be with respect to his lifestyle, it could be with respect to events, it could be with respect to

        places. You can see the endless kinds of domains that are created in a consumer's throughout his life. A
        schema, for the purpose of understanding, is a set of associations concerning a domain. Again, as I told you,
        it can be very subjective, it depends on person to person, it depends on a host of psychological mechanisms

        that operate with respect to the individual's mind. So, there's nothing generalized about the schema except
        that it's a set of associations that are associated with the particular domain.
               Let us explain what is nodes. A node is a point where some information is carried. As I told you,

        Colgate can have the node of a user. The Colgate can have the node of toothpaste, a graphic. Colgate can
        have the node of red because the packaging comes in red. Colgate can have the node of an elderly person.

        The Colgate can have a node of a youngster because they have max fresh, which is a youngsters brand.
        Colgate can also trigger off some associations of a multinational brand. The most interesting point to be noted
        is that when an individual thinks of a node, it triggers some other node. When somebody thinks of Colgate

        that can trigger the node of a child. When somebody thinks of the teeth of a child that can trigger of Colgate.
        So, the triggering of associations between the nodes is something to be taken care of.

               Let me explain what Encoding is. Encoding is a process by which a consumer assigns a symbol or a
        word to what he has been perceived. This becomes very interesting. The consumer assigns a symbol or a
        word, for example, the swoosh symbol of Nike is strongly entrenched in the mind of the consumer. So, he

        has assigned swoosh to represent Nike, to represent the Americanization, to represent youth, to represent a
        positive attitude, to represent fitness, to represent aesthetic footwear, to represent symbolism in footwear.
        You can see the swoosh brand could stand for a variety of things and the stronger the encoding with respect

        to your focus the better it is. Should a consumer think of all associations or should a consumer think of a
        swoosh?
               And the beauty of the subject Consumer Behavior is that there is no rule that every brand should have

        a logo like a swoosh. It's all a question of how well the brand has managed target segment, the thinking of
        target segment, so on and so forth. So, the consumer is able to encode something with respect to a brand. If

        it is a Titan, it could be probably gifting. If it's Italy, it could be fashion. If it's going to be France, it could be
        wine. France can also stand for fashion. If it's going to Germany, it's going to be perfection. So, we can see
        that the encoding takes place in the mind of the consumer, but how it takes place probably is partly within the

        grasp of the marketer. He has the challenge to ensure that the consumer selects the proper encoding, a
        specific symbol or focus symbol at the same time. He also has to ensure that the competitive associations

        do not get into the consumer's mind. For instance, a brand of watch promoting gifting probably will make
        Titan stronger because Titan is strongly associated with gifting.
               The third aspect is imprinting. Brand imprinting is associated with the strengthening of association

        between  the  brand  and  the  information.  We  have  already  said  that  the  each  of  the  nodes  carry  some
        information. For example, the link between NutriChoice from Britannia and Health is very strong when we

                                                                                                              57]]></page><page Index="72"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY

        talk about brand imprinting of NuitriChoice from Britannia. The brand imprinting with respect to the example
        which we have taken Colgate possibly could be oral care with trust. It could possibly be the doctor's coat or
        the doctor appearing in a white coat.

               So, one can very clearly see when brand associations are formed, nurtured, maintained, modified
        schema of the consumer should be taken into account, nodes should be taken into account, the symbol that
        is used for encoding from the consumers and needs to be taken into account, the strength of association

        which is reflected with respect to brand imprinting needs to be taken into account because the strength of
        association possibly has an impact on brand recall.
               A brand recall is a very important and vital characteristic with respect to brand association. There may

        be a number of other parameters. This example, which I have explained with the set of concepts should be
        able to give you an idea about the host of marketing research tools that are employed by the marketeer to

        probe into the consumer's mind.
               So, point number one: There are several concepts that need to be used simultaneously to probe to
        the consumer's mind as far as associations are concerned.

               Point number two: Associations need to take into account the long-term aspects of sustaining the
        associations.

               That's about brand imprinting, encoding, schema, nodes, and the strength of associations.
        Application of Classical Conditioning – Part 2
               There are many other applications of classical conditioning. Let us take a look at two of them very

        briefly.
               One aspect which I had observed in the Indian context is the unusual aspect of counter segmentation
        being associated with associations. It all depends on how the brand manager or the marketer is able to

        conceptualize the situation with the concept. So, this is something which is not limited by the concepts. It's
        not like reading mathematics; there are inputs from the concept, there are inputs from the environment, it is
        for the brand manager to decide how well he's able to integrate these two aspects and create a subjective

        world that will be useful to the brand.
               Counter segmentation typically happens when a brand possibly has a segment that may not really be

        feasible. In the sense that, the brand initially launches an offering for a segment and later point in time realizes
        that the segment is not adequate and tries to enlarge the segment in whatever appropriate manner it can.
        There are a lot of examples available from different countries, I will take the example of a product from Titan.

        This is not to imply that the initial segment was not adequate. I am only making use of this for a conceptual
        purpose to highlight how the variant of counter segmentation can be used by a brand. Even assuming that

        the initial segment created by Titan was sufficient. This is an interesting example to show how the variant of
        counter segmentation can be used through brand associations. Titan had come out with a brand called Zoop
        for kids, and at a later point in time, it extended itself to the teenagers by associating the brand with respect

        to a movie launch, and the movie was Ironman.



                                                                                                              58]]></page><page Index="73"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                     Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus

               So, this is an example of how associations get extended, not only with respect to the existing segment
        but with respect to another segment and I should say that this is the variant of the application of the concept
        called counter segmentation. The idea of using the example of the concept is to put across the message that

        concepts by themselves will not help a brand. Concepts will have to be conceptualized with situation taken
        into account to ensure that a brand benefits.
               Finally, relationships and brands. Can relationships be built with brands? The answer is yes. Susan

        Fournier, a well-known researcher in the area of brand relationships advocated that brands can have their
        relationships with respect to consumers. For instance, fast food like MTR, MTR is a Bangalore based fast
        forward or the fast food can be something from a company like ITC. How can a fast-food brand develop its

        relationship with the consumer as a everyday friend? It is a challenge to the brand. In terms of recipe it offers
        it can be a friend, in terms of organizing an event it can be a friend, in terms of suggesting a new recipe to a

        housewife it can be a friend, in terms of serving the quick need of a youngster on the go it can be a friend, in
        terms of serving a nutritious meal for someone who's on diet it can be a friend. There are several feelings
        associated to friendship. It can be warmth. It can be dependability. It can be trustworthiness. So, one can

        really  see  tremendous  opportunities  that  exist  with  respect  to  brand-consumer  relationships.  In  another
        domain of energy drinks, Red Bull can have a relationship with the youngsters. Red Bull symbolizes party.

        Red bull symbolizes fun. Red bull symbolizes togetherness. Like interpersonal relationships, brand-consumer
        relationships possibly could be one of the ways through which a loyal relationship can be achieved.

               Lesson 5 covers the WEEK 15 - 17 of the course syllabus. After the completion of the lesson,
               students will be able to:

               1.  Determine how conceptualization consumer behavior where applied to industry and

                   competitive structure, brand positioning, and target audience.
               2.  Identify how consumer profiling helps the marketer to gain deeper insights about the customer

               3.  Determine the factors consumers take into consideration before making a purchase and its
                   vital role in understanding the target market.

               4.  Discuss the consumer’s act of shopping and its influence on the marketing plan of the

                   marketer.
               5.  Determine how a consumer is trying out a new product or brand.



               I. CONCEPTUALIZATION OF CONSUMER BEHAVIOR


               The first and the foremost important aspect with respect to application of consumer behavior is the
        object of conceptualization. This aspect of conceptualization is difficult to learn from the books. It's where

        conceptual aspects of the subject are applied to marketing practice. Let us learn the same by understanding
        some of the scenarios where conceptualization of consumer behavior can be applied.
               There are many aspects that one needs to investigate. One of the aspects is perhaps the industry

        structure. The second aspect could be the competitive structure. The third aspect possibly could be the
        manner in which of brands are positioned. The fourth aspect could be the respective target audience. It may
        not be possible to strictly provide a formula on how one should go about the conceptualization, but it is

        possible to provide an appreciative view of how conceptualization could be done.
               Let me give you some examples. Let us consider the different kinds of product categories like soaps

        or green tea. Or even a new product category like an air fryer in the Indian context. All three categories vary
        in terms of their application, and in terms of the kind of involvement it generates with respect to the consumer's
        mind.


                                                                                                              59]]></page><page Index="76"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                     Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus

               Let us consider a brand like Dove. Dove is a very popular brand of soap and it is positioned on its
        moisturizing ability with respect to the skin. If consumer behavior is to be applied to Dove, possibly one could
        think of evaluating the brand equity in terms of the feelings, attributes, and judgments made. That could be

        one aspect of conceptualization. If we talk about the green tea, it is still at a nascent stage, and Lipton today
        advertises green tea in association with the context of youngsters exercising or getting into some kind of a
        sports activity. So, perhaps the attitude towards the category itself can be investigated.

               When we think of a product category like Air Fryer, Air Fryer is completely new to the  Philippine
        context. We know that in the recent times, health and fitness have become a very strong priority, at least in
        the  urban  context.  Several  professionals  who  are  busy  with  respect  to  their  lifestyle  and  work  in  highly

        pressurized environment have shifted their focus on eating as healthy as possible. Air Fryer is a device that
        makes use of a minimum amount of oil in terms of food preparation and appeals to the health-conscious

        consumer base. The challenge here is despite the presence of multinational brands, how could consumer
        interest be created in the category? Or in other words, how consumers’ attitude could be monitored with
        respect to not just the brand, but with respect to the development of the category.

               It could be noted that the consumer's attitude towards the green tea and the consumer's attitude
        towards Air Fryer differs on several other aspects. One is the level of involvement. Second aspect is the

        choices available. Third aspect is the type of investment they are getting into. Many of these things dictate
        conceptualization with respect to consumer behavior.
               We can also get into several other examples. One more example could be Nivea brand. Nivea is a

        multinational brand from Germany catering to the skincare and personal care segment. Nivea’s bathing gel
        is something which is new to the Indian context. The Indian context is full of soaps and soap bars, and slowly
        consumers may want to switch to bathing gel. Nivea today advertisers bathing gel in comparison with the

        soap bars and says that bathing gel of Nivea provides better moisturizing effect as compared to soaps. It is
        interesting  to  note  that  Dove  is  also  positioned  on  the  moisturizing  aspect.  So,  when  we  talk  about
        conceptualization, a marketer may be interested in comparing the intrinsic attributes of the Nivea bathing gel

        with intrinsic attributes of Dove soap.
               Now,  we  are  beginning  to  conceptualize  several  other  aspects  related  to  consumer  behavior.

        Consumer behavior base could come from perception. It could come from associations. It could come from
        attitude. It could come from personality. So, there are several ways in which each of these aspects could be
        conceptualized.

               For the benefit of viewers. I am trying to divide the approach into several pointers. What is to be borne
        in mind is that I am giving you some idea about the practical aspects of applying consumer behavior, but

        what is required is the application of marketing research techniques. Without the application of marketing
        research techniques, the conceptualization cannot be operationalized. This is the reason why one should
        also go through a course in marketing research.

               II. CONSUMER PROFILING

        Basics of Consumer Profiling
               This will give you some idea about what psychographics is with respect to the target segment. In the

        area of consumer products, regardless of the product category, consumer psychographics forms an important
        aspect  of  conceptualization.  There  are  two  aspects  with  respect  to  consumer  profiling.  One  is  the

        demographic, which is the scientific distribution of population in terms of age, income, educational aspects,
        et cetera. The demographics talks about who buys the product or the brand. The psychographics talks about
        why the product is bought.

               When  we  talk  about  psychographics,  it's  a  combination  of  the  application  of  self-concept  with
        personality  traits,  with  the  values  chosen  by  the  consumer,  and  the  lifestyle  of  the  consumer.  Let  me

        elaborate. What is lifestyle? Lifestyle is the manner in which a consumer spends his money and time. When
        we talk about the value with respect to consumer, it is to be understood that this value is not to be confused
        with the brand value. The value with respect to consumer's mindset is to do with the choice of the preferred

        mode of living. How does a consumer want to live? Does the consumer want to make money in terms of
        materialism? Does the consumer want freedom? Does the consumer want self-esteem? Does the consumer
        want adventure? As you can see, the various kinds of choices by which the consumer can live, and value is

        the preferred mode of living with respect to a consumer.
               A combination of several aspects is psychographics. The combination of self-concept, which are the
        thoughts about oneself, along with the personality traits combined with the lifestyle, combined with values,

        these are the four aspects, which fundamentally form what is known as psychographics and psychographics
        are expressed in terms of activities, interests, and opinions. It should be noted that activities, interests, and

        opinions  called  as  AIO  is  to  be  focused  with  respect  to  the  category  and  the  brand,  which  is  under
        consideration.
               For example, if you're considering a brand of watch or the category of watch, the activities, interests,

        and opinions could be centered around the various kinds of aspects, which are to do with the watch. The way
        the watch is used, the way the watch is advertised, the way the watch is bought, the way probably the watch

        is connected with a hobby. (For example, the sports could be a hobby with respect to the consumer and in
        sports there could be cricket, which is of interest to the consumer.)






                                                                                                              61]]></page><page Index="78"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                     Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus

               So, an ardent follower of cricket would be interested in knowing the match score in which case the
        aspect of how the score gets accessed by the smart watch could be a link between the hobbies and the
        watch. I'm giving you a hypothetical example, there are several ways in which the activities, interests, and

        opinions could be approached with respect to a product category and a brand.
        Psychographics
               Using  these  two  kinds  of  consumer  segments  for  example,  executive-1  belongs  to  a  consumer

        segment and executive two belongs to another consumer segment. If you take executive-1, he spends on
        status symbols. He believes in attending parties. He believes in taking foreign vocation. He has very high
        aspirations about himself and his children. He participates in trendy events, lives in a posh locality. This you

        can see is representative of one segment.
               Take for example, the other executives, executive-2, who represents another segment. He's thrifty in

        terms of his money. He is family oriented. He is deeply religious. He's not as ambitious as the executive one
        spends on necessities, tries to save, lives in his ancestral house, believes in some kinds of tradition, you can
        see that there is a significant difference between executive one and executive two.

               The point to be noted is that executive one and two maybe colleagues in a corporate setting and there
        may be earning the same amount of salary. The way they have their lifestyles, the way they spend their

        money, the way they spend their time is the significant differences with respect to their psychographics.
               So, that should give you some idea about what psychographics is all about. So, to begin with, the
        conceptualization needs to be followed with psychographics. The reason is that the psychographics has an

        impact on what is a value with respect to your brand has an impact on where the segment lives, has an
        impact on how the segment chooses their vocation, so on and so forth.

              III. VALUE ASSOCIATED WITH BRANDS


               Value is an important aspect because it forms the foundation for several other marketing activities
        concerning promotion, concerning pricing, concerning several aspects including where the brand should be

        advertised to reach their target segment.
               There  are  three  kinds  of  values  that  could  be  associated  with  a  brand.  Just  for  clarity,  please
        remember that I've already clarified the difference between the value associated with the brand and the value

        associated with respect to consumers' choice of lifestyle. The three kinds of values are functional value,
        symbolic value, and experiential value. It is to be noted that these kinds of values are not mutually exclusive.

        Let me give you an example to illustrate this. Take for example, Red Bull. Red Bull is an energy drink. The
        Red Bull has the functional value of keeping you away from sleep. It has a symbolic value when you use Red
        Bull to celebrate, partying along with your friends. Red Bull also has an experiential or the sensual value of

        giving you the sensual pleasure when you consume it physically. You can see that it has got three kinds of
        values. The point is, which is the value the consumer segment is interested in? What kinds of overlap all they

        interested in?
               When you are talking about an event, when you talk about an advertising, when you want to promote
        a brand, which is the value that should be dominant? Which functions as the value proposition of the brand?

        If you take example of iPhone, the iPhone is associated with all these values. The iPhone is capable of a
        multitude of functions, which is a functional value. The iPhone is symbolic all over the world. It's a premium
        phone, which possibly could be extended as an extension of your own personality. It has got an experiential

        value because of the user's interface with iPhone. It feels good to handler iPhone. Again, research has to
        clearly spell out what kinds of values the consumer is interested in.
               The second aspect is to do with the cultural beliefs concerning the respective category. When we

        consider the category of gold in India, Tanishq is a leading brand in the category. There are also several
        other leading brands in the category. It should be noted as a marketer, there should be some amount of

        sensitivity to the cultural beliefs associated with gold. Let us quickly take a look at the various kinds of beliefs
        associated with gold. Gold can be associated with prosperity. Gold can also be associated with the divinity.
        Gold can be associated with sterling standards. Gold can be associated with religious rituals. Gold can be

        associated with classism; gold can be associated with fashion. As you can see, there are various kinds of
        cultural beliefs associated with most of the categories they need to be taken into account.

              IV. ACT OF SHOPPING

               We can see that today, in the Filipino context, there is a hybrid of offline sales shops and online

        websites. So, where does the consumer shop from? It could be jewelry, it could be vegetables, it could be
        apparel, it could be watches, it could be mobile.
               So, does the consumer shop in closing stores, in which case ambiance becomes important, in which

        case variety becomes very important, in which case the service becomes very important or does he or she
        shop in a discount shop.

               How often does he make use of discount shop? Does the discount shopping have an impact on the
        brand equity if the same brand is available in the discount shop or in the brick and mortar shop or on the
        offline website? For example, online websites trade several kinds of brands, which are also available in

        discount shops. So, how should the brand try to maintain consistent association among the consumers of
        offline shopping and online shopping is one of the challenges, which confront a marketeer today.

               For example, if a consumer is shopping with respect to malls, the competitive brands may also be
        there. So, what kind of influence do the competitors have with respect to the consumer when the consumer
        shops in a mall? Is it going to be different from the consumer's memory when he's not frequently shopping in

        the mall?
               For example, if the consumer does not shop in the mall, he may be, he or she may be using in his
        internal memory to compare brands whereas if the consumer is a frequent shopper with respect to malls,

        then he would do a real-time comparison with the brands and these do impact his selection of the brand.

              V. CONSUMER RECEPTIVITY TO A NEW PRODUCT


               Let us discuss other aspects related to the receptivity of new products and product trails with respect

        to the consumer segment.
               For example, if coffee bags are introduced, would the consumer be interested in trying it out. What
        about the past experience of brands? Would the consumer be satisfied with the past experience? or despite

        being satisfied with the experience, would the consumer want to try out a new brand because the new brand
        is updated. What about the loyalty patterns? Several brands today have an exclusive club for a loyalty, and

        these loyalty clubs have a lot of privileges. So, what kind of privileges should be given to the loyal consumers?
                                                                                                              65]]></page><page Index="82"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                     Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus

        How should they be differentiated from other consumers? It has to be noted that there cannot be feeling of
        discrimination between the loyal consumers and the regular consumers and at the same time, the loyal
        consumers need to be rewarded.

                  What about the consumer's tendency to use credit cards? Does the consumer spend more while
        he or she uses a credit card in a particular ambiance? Is there instant gratification with respect to the selection
        of products and brands. For example, apparel. For example, certain kinds of groceries. So, these are some

        of the other aspects that needs to be understood while focusing on the receptivity of the consumer.
        Conclusion
                  I would like to conclude this module with a few suggestions with respect to learning consumer

        behavior. Please note that consumer behavior cannot be learned in isolation. Consumer behavior requires
        certain amount of prerequisites from basic marketing. For instance, when you want to apply perception to a

        host of offerings in the product line, a watch brand could have a product line, different kinds of watches with
        different designs at different price points. When we talk about the usage of perception, we talk about a
        concept like just noticeable difference. In order to appreciate the nuances of consumer behavior, you need

        to  know  the  basics  of  marketing.  Unless  you  know  what  a  product  line  management  is,  it's  difficult  to
        appreciate the nuances of perception, which are applied to product line management. So, my suggestion is

        learn theory and learn marketing principles as the basic course.
                  The second aspect is to associate theory with your own environment. There are multitude of ways
        in which this could be done. There are multitude of scenarios, there are multitude of tools that can be applied.

        This is something which comes only by practice.
                  The  third  aspect  is,  trying  to  have  rigor  with  relevance.  There  is  one  school  of  thought  that
        academics is far remote from practical realities. And this is completely misleading in the present-day context.

        In fact, one gets ideas only from academics, and at the same time, the academics does not mean that
        everything is practicable. So how do you have a balance between their marketing realities and the academic
        theories? You will have to have rigor with relevance.

                  Finally,  consumer  behavior  needs  to  be  synergized  with  brand  management  or  advertising  or
        retailing or even customer relationships management. I do hope that you had a good understanding of the

        basic  course  on  behavioral  dimensions  on  marketing management. This  is  a  basic  course  because  this
        domain is an ocean with a plethora of possibilities to learn and this is just an introductory course with the
        objective of introducing you to certain behavioral concepts. All the best.

                                          Intended Learning Outcomes (ILO)

               After the completion of the chapter, students will be able to:
               1. Understand a background in industrial marketing
               2. Analyze the industrial marketing consumers, products and services

                Lesson Proper: Introduction to industrial and agricultural marketing product

               Marketing is the process of performing market research, selling products and/or
               services to customers and promoting them via advertising to further enhance sales. It
               generates the strategy that underlies sales techniques, business communication and
               business developments. It is an integrated process through which companies build
               strong customer relationships and create value for their customers and for themselves.


               What is industrial marketing?

               Industrial marketing happens when one business tries to sell industrial products or
               services to another.

               For clarity, an industrial product or service is anything that helps produce an end
               product from raw materials.

               It’s a form of B2B marketing, but because of the nature of what’s being sold, an
               industrial marketing campaign requires a high level of product knowledge.

               • In industrial marketing, the basic concepts of marketing remain the same as we find in
               consumer marketing. Industrial marketing is quite challenging and the marketers have
               to understand the nature of industrial marketing.


               • Basically, industrial marketing is also referred as ‘Business Marketing’ or
               ‘Organizational Marketing’. It means that industrial marketing is the marketing of
               products and services to business and other organizations for use in the manufacturing
               and marketing of other products and services.





                                                            - 4 -]]></page><page Index="93"><![CDATA[• Business organizations include manufacturing companies, government organizations,
               private sector, banking and insurance institutions, educational institutions, hotels,
               hospitals, etc.

               • Business organizations buy products and services for producing other goods and
               services for making profits.

               • On the other hand, consumer marketing is the marketing of products and services to
               households. Here, the consumers buy products and services for their own consumption.


               • In industrial marketing, neatly arranged organized activities relating to business are
               undertaken by the marketers with the intention of early capture of new markets and to
               make possible effective distribution of goods in regular markets as well as in new
               markets.

               • Every industrial unit act as a consumer because they buy and use raw materials;
               consume electric power, energy and fuel on a large scale so as to produce a variety of
               goods required by the people in the society.

               • This activity as a part of the industrial marketing system makes possible the creation of
               demand, regular flow of goods in the market so as to equalize supply and demand in
               the market. It helps in the proper functioning of an economy.

               • In every market, there is a flow and backflow of products. In a market system there are
               three elements or parties namely: ‚ producers ‚ buyers ‚ sellers

                Lesson Proper: Types of business consumer
               The term industry may be classified into three broad industries:


                   •   Extractive industry
                   •   Manufacturing industry
                   •   Constructive industry
               The marketers marketing the industrial products must determine such marketing
               strategies to become more competitive


               than their competitors as far as reaching and satisfying the target customers are
               concerned.

               • Extractive industry

               Extractive industries are those industries which are involved in the extraction of mineral
               resources, coal mines,





                                                            - 5 -]]></page><page Index="94"><![CDATA[oil, iron ore, etc., which are generally demanded by manufacturing units as their
               important raw materials. In fact,

               extractive industries are sources of raw material to manufacturing units.

               • Manufacturing industry


               The manufacturing units are required to make optimum use of raw material by using
               new techniques and manufacturing

               the finished goods and services.



               • Constructive industry

               Construction industries require cement, iron, steel, windows, doors, etc., for
               constructing bridges, offices, buildings,


               roads, dams, etc. It is therefore concluded that there should always be a regular flow of
               raw materials to the

               manufacturing units.

                Lesson Proper: Classification of industrial products and services
               • Industrial product is a term which covers a very wide range of products i.e., from
               office pins to computers and big machines.


               • Industrial products are classified on the basis of products and services entering into
               the production process and their relative cost.

               Materials and Parts

               • These goods enter the product directly. These consist of raw materials, manufactured
               materials, component parts and sub-assemblies.

               • The cost of these items is treated by the purchasing company as a part of the
               manufacturing cost.

               • Basic products like iron ore, crude oil, fish, fruits, vegetables, etc., are examples of raw
               materials.


               • It may be marketed to user customers.

               • Raw materials are the basic products that are used in the production process for
               manufacturing the final product.


                                                            - 6 -]]></page><page Index="95"><![CDATA[• Manufactured materials are those raw materials which are subject to the sum amount
               of processing before entering the manufacturing process. Acids, fuel oil, steel and
               chemicals are such examples.

               • Component parts are semi-finished parts and can be installed directly into products.
               Batteries, plugs, bearings, etc., are few examples.

               • Normally the component parts are also sold to the dealers or distributors who resell
               them to the replacement market.


               • Sub-assemblies are semi-finished goods like the exhaust pipe in a motorcycle.



               Capital Items

               • These are used in the production process and can be classified as heavy equipment,
               light equipment and plant and buildings.

               • Heavy equipment are major and long-term investment items.

               • These items are taken as fixed assets; since such items are of high value, these are
               usually financed by borrowing money for a period of time. • Furnaces, machines,
               turbines, generators, etc., are heavy equipment.

               • Light equipment and tools are of lower values and are not considered a part of heavy
               equipment.


               • Hand tools and computer terminals are some examples of light equipment. These may
               also be considered as fixed assets of the company and therefore depreciated over a
               period of few years.

               • Plant and buildings are real-estate property of a company. Real estate includes the
               firm’s offices, plants, warehouses, housing, etc.

               Supplies and Services

               • These goods/services support the operation of the purchasing organization.
               • Items like paints, fuel, packaging material, lubricants, stationery, etc., belong to this
               category.

               • Legal auditing, advertising, courier, marketing research, etc., are services which may
               be required by the company.

               Industrial Purchasing System

               Industrial purchasing is totally different as compared to individual consumer purchases
               due to the nature of business, size of the enterprise as well as volume, variety and


                                                            - 7 -]]></page><page Index="96"><![CDATA[technical complexity of the products purchased. Since the industrial marketers sell their
               products to different types of industrial customers, it is important to know the purchasing
               practices adopted by those industrial customers.

                   Commercial Enterprises Purchasing System

               • In large and medium size organizations, persons from different departments like
               production, finance and engineering are usually involved in taking purchase decisions.

               • Various functional heads who are experts in material planning, supplier rating system,
               value-analysis, price trends and negotiating skills act as influencers in purchasing
               decisions. Such organizations normally have their own purchasing procedures and
               documentation.

               • They strictly follow the laid down procedures and documentation.

               • The major tasks taken by such enterprises are identifying potential suppliers,
               negotiating and selecting suppliers, ensuring right quality and quantity of material at the
               right time and developing long-term business relationships with suppliers.


               • Such enterprises always look into savings in material cost and getting good quality
               materials at the right time.

               • It makes the company’s product pricing competitive and increases the overall
               profitability of the enterprise.

               Government Purchase System

               • Industrial marketers must understand the purchasing system followed in government
               units in case they want to get business from the government units.

               • Central and State Government undertakings and public sector units are included in
               government units and they are the largest purchasers of industrial goods and services.

               • In government units, the name of the company and products are normally registered.

               • The registration is done after certain registration procedures followed and inspection
               done by the inspectors of these government units.


               • These inspectors look at the company’s manufacturing facilities and their capability in
               supplying goods to the government units.

               • Tenders are advertised in newspapers and the authorized suppliers are required to
               submit tender offers in sealed envelopes as per the instructions given in the tender
               papers.

               • In the tender form, the supplier clearly mentions the specifications of products, the
               prices, the delivery schedule and other relevant commercial terms and conditions.



                                                            - 8 -]]></page><page Index="97"><![CDATA[• The tender is normally opened before the tender committee and the person offering
               the lowest price and the required delivery period are normally rewarded the order.

               • In some cases, there may be negotiations with the suppliers before awarding the
               purchase order.

               • The DGS&D is an agency which finalizes running contracts for various standard
               products (fans, tubes, bulbs) on behalf of the central government. Such products are
               bought by government units on rate-contract prices decided by DGS&D from all the
               government units.


               Institutional Purchasing

               • Institutional buyers like hospital, colleges which are government organizations
               normally follow the government purchase procedures.

               • Privately owned institutions follow purchase procedures similar to commercial
               enterprises.

               Purchasing in the Resellers’ Market

               • Industrial dealers or distributors are appointed by manufacturers to sell their products
               for the replacement market.


               • These industrial dealers normally work for profits and sales volume.

               • They select a supplier on the basis of the brand name of the supplier, the product
               quality and the pricing policy.

               • These distributors sometimes represent the supplier also for supplying goods to the
               industry.

               • The supplier supports these industrial distributors by introducing them to various
               industries, supporting them with advertising inputs and providing them with leaflets or
               display materials.

               • These suppliers offer competitive prices and trade discounts, credit facilities and
               service facilities to such distributors/dealers.


               • The dealer/distributor works in harmony with the supplier and makes all effort to beat
               the competition, increase the business share and make reasonable profits.

               • Industrial distributors/dealers will remain loyal to the supplier till he makes profits,
               otherwise switch over to another supplier.

               them deal with different brands.

               • Any supplier dealing with industrial dealers or distributors in the reseller market must
               take care of their profits since the main objective of an industrial dealer is to earn profits.

               Purchasing in Co-operative Societies


               • Co-operative societies, while making purchase decisions emphasize on factors such
               as quality, delivery, price, payment terms, service and long-term relationship with
               supplier.

               • Co-operative societies normally follow the practices which are followed in institutional
               purchasing.

               • Each co-operative society may have some differences in buying practices. Therefore,
               industrial marketers should try to understand the purchasing practices of each co-
               operative society in order to be effective in marketing their goods and services.

               INDUSTRIAL SERVICE

               The services in the industrial market can be classified into two groups:


               ‚ Product supported by services

               ‚ Pure services

               • Product supported by services

               ‚ No tangible goods and services are offered to a customer without some associated
               services. These services may not even be considered services as they are perceived as
               part of the offering.

               ‚ However, the service component can be a major or a minor part of the total offer from
               the company.


               ‚ In industrial marketing, the component of services is generally an important
               consideration by the client while deciding to buy an industrial product.

               ‚ Maintenance and repairs of material handling equipment, supply, installation and
               maintenance of high value industrial products are such services which are very valuable
               to customers and industrial marketers always insist on these services while selling the
               industrial product.

               Pure services like banking, legal services, consultancy services, recruitment services
               are marketed without any association with physical products.

               Unique Characteristics of Services


               • There are four distinctive characteristics of services which create special marketing
               challenges and opportunities.

               • Some of the methods used by service firms to achieve a closer match between
               demand and supply are:

                      o  Shifting of some demand from peak to off-peak periods by adopting differential
                         pricing.
                      o  Reservation systems are used to manage the demand by some service firms
                         like airlines, hotels, etc.
                      o  Part-time employees are hired to serve the peak demand. Even outsourcing of
                         services of small firms can be done to serve the peak demand.


               • These four elements are referred by some researchers as the four ‘I’s of
               services namely:

                   ✓  Intangibility
                   ✓  Inconsistency
                   ✓  Inseparability
                   ✓  Inventory

               • Intangibility

                   ▪  Intangibility is a characteristic of service indicating that it has no physical
                       attributes and as a result impossible
                   ▪  for a customer to taste, feel, hear or smell before they buy it. Therefore, the
                       customer for many services has to buy them on trust since they cannot be
                       inspected before use.
                   ▪  The intangible nature of services makes consumer concerns about their
                       providers. In fact, people are becoming greatly concerned about the service
                       providers, their background and their qualifications.
                   ▪  To reduce uncertainty, industrial buyers look for evidence or experience in
                       determining service quality.
                   ▪  It is the task of the service marketers to market the service with tangible
                       evidence.
                   ▪  ‚ A firm’s promotional efforts must show the benefits to be derived from a service,
                       rather than emphasizing the service itself.

                       particular level of quality.

               • Inconsistency

                   ▪  Inconsistency is also referred to as variability or heterogeneity. Inconsistency
                       occurs largely because:
                   ▪  Different service providers perform a given service on different occasions. The
                       service performance by an individual provider may differ over time.
                   ▪  Interaction between customer and provider may vary by customer.
                   ▪  Every time a service is performed, the process and the customer experience are
                       different.
                   ▪  The service organization designs the service delivery system to control variability
                       and to influence the heterogeneity of the service experienced by the customer.
                   ▪  To ensure effective quality control, industrial marketers in service firms can take
                       steps like mechanizing, automating, standardizing and rationalizing available
                       options.

               • Inseparability

                   ▪  Inseparability is a characteristic of a service indicating that the production and
                       consumption of service take place simultaneously. Hence the relationship
                       between the buyer and the seller is an important element.
                   ▪  Many services are created, delivered and consumed simultaneously through
                       interaction between customer and service producer.
                   ▪  It is therefore important for the industrial service firms to give special attention to
                       recruitment, training and developing the people who provide services to the client
                       organization.

               • Inventory


                   ▪  The inventory relates to the perishability characteristic in services marketing. The
                       services cannot be easily saved, stored or inventoried. Inventory problems exist
                       with services because of their perishable nature.

                Lesson Proper: Buyer-seller relationship
               Introduction


               Industrial Buying in some ways is similar to consumer buying since it is not the industry
               (organization) making the buying decisions but people within those organizations. But
               the industrial marketer must understand the significant differences in order to succeed
               in the industrial market. Industrial buyers search for efficient suppliers or vendors who
               can deliver goods as per the requirements of the industries. In an industry, there is a
               separate department called purchase department whose function is to develop
               organizational buying objectives and perform activities so as to have regular and
               adequate flow of goods and services into the operations and see that the work of the
               firm does not suffer

               Supplier relationship

               Different industrial buyers have developed the purchase departments in them
               organization. Because, manufacturing firms spend more than fifty per cent of their sales
               revenue on purchase.

               To develop a good long-term supplier/vendor relationship and to develop new sources
               of supply, industrial marketers need to understand that purchasing objectives.

               These objectives are also based on the company objectives. Resultantly, the buying
               members of an organization are also influenced by both purchasing objectives of the
               firm and personal objectives. Personal objectives of industrial buyers include higher
               status, job security, salary increments, promotions and social considerations: friendship,
               mutually beneficial relationships, and personal favors. The industrial buyers try to
               achieve both objectives simultaneously. The industrial marketer’s ought to realize that it

               personal objectives of the buying members.



                Lesson Proper: MODERN PURCHASING ACTIVITIES
               There are some contemporary purchasing activities, which are used in industrial buying
               processes. These are discussed as follows:


               Just-in-Time (JIT)

               It refers that the material arrives at the buyer ‘s factory exactly when needed by the
               buyer. It minimizes the inventory, and increases the quality and productivity. The goal of
               JIT delivery is zero inventory and excellent quality of the material delivered by the
               supplier. This ensures nil rejection at the buyer ‘s factory. The JIT delivery means that
               the buying and selling organizations work together closely to reduce costs.

               Single Sourcing

               In this activity, the industrial customers place orders with only one supplier not to two or
               three suppliers. It means all the eggs are not in one basket. The practice makes
               possible for the buying and selling organizations to work closely together, involve the
               supplier from the design stage, and utilize the supplier ‘s expertise.

               Value Analysis


               The industrial buyers to reduce cost with maintaining product reliability use the value
               analysis. It involves analyzing a product item by the function it performs, the value of the
               function, and the alternate methods of performing the same function. It uses creative
               technique like brainstorming and includes members of various departments such as
               production, quality control, design, industrial engineering, marketing, and purchase.

               Purchase Committee

               Some industrial buyers develop a formalized decision-making unit i.e. purchase
               committee. It is used in many industrial organizations including institutions (such as
               universities and hospitals) and Government companies. Generally, in a typical purchase
               committee, one or two individuals nominate in the decision-making. The salesperson
               must provide information to all the members of the purchase committee, and should
               target the real sales efforts to those dominant members who influence the buying
               decisions. Identifying purchase committee individuals, their technical and commercial
               expertise, their individual needs, buying decision process, and the organization
               structure are the important tasks to be performed by the effective industrial marketer

                4. Exercise high personal moral and ethical standard



                Lesson Proper: Industrial product life-cycle and strategies

               Like living beings’ products have life cycle. The Product Life Cycle is depicted by the
               sales curve of the product since its introduction. According to the Product Life Cycle
               theory, products tend to go through different cycles of stages that begin when they are
               launched in the market and ends when they are eliminated from the market. At the
               dividing line between the growth and the maturity stages the profit curve is at its peak.
               In the maturity stage, sales volume continues to increase at a decreasing rate but the
               profits fall. Factors such as changing technology, changing competition, changing needs
               of the customers will have a strong bearing on the behavior pattern of Product Life
               Cycle.

               concept also highlights the significance of long-range planning for new product. This point
               should be kept in mind while estimating return on investment during the business analysis
               stage of new product development process. Usually most of the industrial products follow
               a set pattern in its PLC as shown in figure above, but in certain cases the products may
               not follow the set pattern. One such case is the pattern of high-tech products like computer
               & telecommunication goods. In case of these products the new product development cost
               and time are high. The introduction, growth stages are long but the maturity and decline
               period are short (figure below) This is because of rapid
               change in technology.





















               The Products such as steel, cement etc., the demand remains relatively inelastic

               a decline. Once the competition becomes intense the situation would change and sales
               would show a decline (Figure below)


















               Another point worth consideration in the PLC concept is that the profit from a product
               reaches its highest level before sales reach its peak. Usually growth stage brings profit.
               In the beginning part of maturity stage, profit reaches its highest level and afterwards
               sales reach peak level in the later part of maturity stage. This is due to the competition
               in terms of low prices, better services and aggressive promotions by competitive firms.
               The marketing costs go up and profit starts declining. As a result of the efforts of the
               company to launch a new industrial product for the first time in the market, fights back
               the competition in maturity stage by reducing the price, to match the competition spends
               more money on promotion, builds more intensive distribution, or new models by bringing
               major changes to the existing products. Industrial marketing firms have to adopt the
               following three important steps for developing long term product strategies for existing
               individual products and products lines.

               1. Assessing the performance of all the existing products or product lines by using
               product evaluation matrix.
               2. Examining the relative strengths and weakness of the firm ‘s products in comparison
               to competitors ‘products by using perceptual mapping technique.
               3. Deciding the product strategies for the existing products based on the above
               analysis.

               Product Evaluation Matrix: Yoran Wind & Henry Clay Camp have developed a
               technique called product evaluation matrix to be used to assess the product
               performance. Performance parameters of a product such as industrial sales, company
               sales, market share and profitability are combined in the matrix.



                                                            - 17 -]]></page><page Index="106"><![CDATA[Industry sales are represented on vertical axis and are grouped as growth, stable or
               decline. Company sales are assessed on horizontal axis and are grouped as, stable or
               decline. In the same manner profitability is classified as below target and above target
               and market share as dominant, average or marginal.

                   These classifications need to be defined by the marketing manager depending on
                     the situation prevailing in the industry. For example, if the market share is less
                     than 10 percent, it is evaluated as marginal, market share between 10 and 30
                   percent is considered as average, and more than 30 percent as dominant. Let us
                   apply the same classification of market share to a company having two products.
                     Product P has a dominant market share of 50 percent. The average growth of
                   company sales in the past three years is 40 percent. Industry sales have grown at
                    the rate of 35 percent per year for the past three years and profitability is as per
                      expectations. The marketing strategy for product P is to continue or maintain

                Lesson Proper: Factors influencing pricing decisions


               •There are a number of factors which influence business pricing decisions. Some are
               external or environmental factors (such as competition, demand conditions, government
               regulation, etc.) and others are internal factors (pricing objectives, cost conditions,
               pricing policies, etc.). An industrial marketing firm has to consider the following
               important factors in its pricing decisions.

                   o  Pricing objectives
                   o  Demand analysis

                   o  Government regulations
               Pricing objectives

               •Pricing objectives should be derived from corporate and marketing objectives. If the
               company has selected its target market and market positioning carefully, then its
               marketing mix strategy including price will be fairly straightforward.

               •Pricing objectives are largely determined by the prior decision on market positioning.
               For example, if the company wants to maximize profits, it may charge higher prices and
               in case of maximizing the market share it should set an even lower price. A company
               can pursue many objectives; however, some of the major objectives are described
               below:

                   Survival

               •Companies pursue as their major objective if the factory production capacity is
               underutilized; intense competition or large inventory of unsold finished products; to keep
               the plant operating and the inventory turnover, companies will often cut prices. In such a
               situation, profits are less important than survival. As long as prices cover variable costs
               and some fixed costs, companies stay in business. However, survival is only a short-run
               objective. In the long run the firm must raise its prices to cover total cost.

                   Maximum Current Profit

               •Many companies try to set the price with the objective of maximizing current profits.
               They estimate the demand and costs associated with alternative prices and choose the
               price that produces maximum current profit, cash flow or rate of return on investment.

               The company emphasize on current financial performance rather than long run
               performance.

               •The companies following these objectives generally ignore competitor reaction and
               legal implications on price.

                   Maximum Current Revenue

               •Some companies will set a price to maximize short-term sales revenue.

               •Revenue maximization requires sales forecast over a period of time. Industrial
               marketers believe that revenue maximization will lead to long run profit maximization
               and market share growth.
                   Maximum Sales Growth

               Some companies want to maximize unit sales and for that they set the lowest price
               assuming the market is price sensitive. This is called market penetration pricing. This is

               run profit.

                   Maximum Market Skimming

               •Many companies favor setting high prices to ‘skim’ the market. Companies set high
               prices in the initial stages of the product life-cycle when they introduce new and
               innovative products.

               •Market skimming makes sense under the following conditions:

                   ▪  a sufficient number of buyers have a high current demand
                   ▪  the high initial price does not attract more competitors
                   ▪  the high price communicates the image of the superior product


                    Product Quality Leadership

               •A company may have an objective to be product quality leader in a market.

               •The company therefore, produces superior quality product and charges slightly higher
               prices than the competitor’s prices. Such pricing objective results in higher than average
               rate of return to the company.

                   Other Pricing Objectives

               Non-profit and public organisations may adopt a number of other pricing objectives such
               as ‘partial cost recovery’, ‘full cost recovery’, social price, etc.

               Demand Analysis

               •Each price that the company might charge will lead to a different level of demand and
               will therefore have a different impact on its marketing objectives.

               •The relation between the current price charged and the resulting current demand is
               important for industrial marketers to understand. Although in the normal case demand
               and price are inversely related, it may not be the same in case of prestige goods.
               •The concept of demand curve and price elasticity is useful while understanding the
               relationship between demand and price. The relationship between price and demand
               can be measured by experimental research. In measuring the price and demand
               relationship, the market researcher should control factors like promotion and customer
               service which may also affect the demand. Most companies make some attempts to
               measure their demand schedules. In researching the demand schedule, the investigator
               needs to make assumptions about competitive behavior.
                   ▪  There are two ways to estimate demand. One is to assume that competitor’s
                       prices remain constant regardless of the price charged by the company;



                                                            - 22 -]]></page><page Index="111"><![CDATA[▪   the other is to assume that competitors charge a different price for each price
                       the company might set. However, the basic purpose of estimating the demand
                       schedule is to find out to what extent the demand for a product changes with the
                       changes in the prices.
               •If demand hardly changes with a small change in price, then the demand is inelastic
               and in case demand changes substantially with a small change in price, then demand is
               elastic.

               •        Price elasticity of demand is determined by the following formula:








               Suppose, when a seller raises the price by 2 %, the demand falls by 10 %, the price
               elasticity of demand is -5 [The (-) sign confirms the inverse relationship between price
               and demand]. If demand falls by 2% with a 2% increase in price, then elasticity is -1, it
               means the seller’s total revenue remains the same. The seller sells fewer items but ata
               higher price that maintains the same total revenue. If demand falls by 1% when price
               has increased by 2%, then elasticity is -0.5. The less elastic the demand, the more it
               pays for the seller to raise the price.

                   Determining Price Elasticity of Demand


               •Demand is likely to be less elastic under the following conditions:

                   ▪  There are few competitors.
                   ▪  There are no substitute products from other industries.
                   ▪  Buyers readily do not notice the higher price.
                   ▪  Buyers are slow to change their buying habits and search for lower prices.
                   ▪  Buyer thinks that the higher prices are justified by quality improvements, normal
                       inflation, etc.
                          •  If the demand is elastic rather than inelastic, sellers will consider lowering
                              the price. A lower price will produce more total revenue. It is good as long
                              as the cost of producing and selling more units do not increase
                              disproportionately.
               Cost Analysis


               •The company while making its pricing strategy or decisions must consider the cost
               involved. Any company cannot charge the price of their commodity beyond certain limit
               because demand is going to be affected and therefore, demand largely sets a ceiling to
               the price. The company wants to charge a price that covers its cost ofproducing
               distributing and selling the product with fair return for its efforts and risks.

                                                            - 23 -]]></page><page Index="112"><![CDATA[•A company’s cost takes two forms i.e. Fixed and Variable cost. Fixed costs are those
               costs that do not vary with production or sales revenue. Fixed costs go on regardless of
               the production level. A company has to pay each month for rent, interest charges, and
               managerial salaries irrespective of the company’s output.

               •Variable costs vary directly with the level of production. For example, raw materials and
               direct labor cost. They are called variable because their total varies with the number of
               units produced.

               •Total costs consist of the sum of the fixed and the variable costs for any given level of
               production. Management wants to charge a price that will at least cover the total
               production cost at a given level of production.


               •An industrial marketer must understand how cost varies with different levels of
               production if he wants to price his product intelligently. The company may use
               economies of scale by building larger plant size to compete effectively.


               •The accumulated experience of the management helps in reduction of cost. They can
               also change as a result of concentrated effort by company’s designers, engineers and
               purchasing agents to reduce them. The Japanese in particular, use a method called
               ‘target costing’. They use market research to establish a new product’s desired
               functions, and then they determine the price at which the product must sell, given its
               appeal and competitor’s price. They deduct the desired profit margin from this price and
               this leaves the target cost they must achieve. Then they examine each cost element like
               design, engineering, manufacturing, sales and so on. They consider ways to reengineer
               the components, eliminate functions and bring down supplier cost. The whole objective
               is to bring the final cost projections into the target cost range. If they cannot succeed,
               they may decide against developing the product because it could not sell for the target
               price and make the target profit.


               •Target costing focuses on taking costs out of the product during the planning and
               designing stage rather than trying to reengineer cost after the product has been
               introduced.

               •An industrial marketer must also understand the effect of break-even analysis on cost
               and sales volume. Breakeven analysis is a financial technique which is used by the
               marketers to consider different prices and their possible effects on sales volume and
               profits.

               •The break-even volume is calculated by the formula:

               price elasticity of demand. The company should also consider lowering its fixed and/or
               variable cost by using economies of scale. Bringing down the cost will further lower the
               break-even volume and improve profits.

               Competitive Analysis


               •Industrial marketers, while making the pricing strategy keep competitors’ pricing as
               their benchmark. An industrial firm needs to learn the price and the quality of the
               competitor’s offer. The firm can acquire the competitor’s price list and buy the
               competitor’s equipment and can ask buyers how they perceive the price and quality of
               each competitor’s offer.

               •Once the company is aware of the competitor’s prices and offers, it can use these as
               basis for its own pricing. If the firm’s offer is similar to a major competitor’s offer, then
               the firm will have to price close to the competitor otherwise they will lose sales. If the
               firm’s offer is inferior, the firm will not be able to change more than the competitor. If the
               firm’s offer is superior, the firm can charge more than the competitor. The firm must be
               aware that the competitor might change their prices in response to the firm’s price.
               Basically, the firm will use price to position its offer vis-à-vis competitors.

               Government Regulations

               •Government regulations always make an effect on pricing decisions of industrial
               marketers. There are always some necessary restrictions that must be placed in
               business to ensure fair play and to protect consumers and smaller companies.

               •Price fixing’, ‘price cartels’ are illegal as per the MRTP Act.


               •The government has also enacted the competition act to ensure that suppliers cannot
               create a situation to exploit the consumers by charging higher prices.

               •Price discrimination: A company must offer the same discount structure to its channel
               partners otherwise it is interpreted as price discrimination. It is prohibited to offer
               different trade, volume or cash discounts to dealers since it amounts to price
               discrimination. However, it is difficult to generalize because of different interpretations
               made by different courts in different situations.

               •Predatory pricing: When a company with dominant position lowers it pricing structure to
               restrict new or smaller firms operating in a profitable manner, it is called predatory
               pricing. The basic objective of such pricing strategy of the dominant firm is to kill the
               competitors.

               After the analysis of pricing objectives, demand, costs, competition and government
               regulations, the appropriate pricing strategy should be formulated by the industrial
               marketer. Pricing strategies vary as the industrial product moves through its life cycle.
               The pricing strategy is a key factor in each of the four cells of Product Life Cycle.

               Introductory Stage Pricing Strategy: There are two pricing strategies available for a new
               product which is in the introductory stage of its life cycle.


               These are: (a) Penetration Strategy, and (b) Skimming Strategy. An industrial

               marketer must analyze the price from the angle of the buyers. How soon the

               firm should try to recover the investment on the new product is another

               important factor to be considered by the industrial marketer.

               (a) Penetration Strategy: When the price elasticity of demand is high or the buyers are
               highly price sensitive, strong threat exists from potential competitors and opportunity
               exists to reduce the unit cost of production and distribution with increase in volumes the
               penetration strategy is effective. The firm can draw on experience curve effect and can
               also achieve the economies of scale. This would give the company a strategic
               advantage of cost leadership over the competitors. The firm can adopt the pricing
               objective of long-term profit through large market share instead of short-term profit
               objectives.


               (b) Skimming Strategy: For distinctly new product meant for a market segment that is
               not sensitive to the initial high price the skimming strategy can be adopted. The greatest
               advantage of this strategy is that it focuses on recovering the investment at an early
               stage by generating moiré profits. The price will be reduced at the latter stages to reach
               other market segments that are more sensitivity to price. The limitation of the skimming
               strategy is that more competitors are attracting due to high profits. The products that are
               distinctive with sophisticated technology and capital intensity are suitable to adopt this
               strategy.

               Growth Stage Pricing Strategy: As the new competitors enter the market and more
               customers start using the product at growth stage the industrial marketer face the
               pressure of reducing the prices below the introduction stage. At this stage the industrial
               marketer focuses his attention on product differentiation, product line extension and
               building new market segments at this stage. As more suppliers enter the market the

               Therefore, the innovator firms are under the pressure to reduce the price.

               Maturity Stage pricing strategy: The competitors are very aggressive in the maturity
               stage. The industrial marketer has to cut into competitors ‘market share to increase
               sales volume. By adopting the low-price strategy to match the competitor ‘s prices the
               industrial marketer can achieve the high volume of sales.

               Decline Stage Pricing Strategy: At the decline stage the industrial marketer has a
               wide choice of pricing strategies subject to certain conditions. The firm need not cut the
               price but reduce the cost to earn sum profits provided it has built a reputation of high
               product quality and dependable services. Another major strategy is to reduce the prices
               to increases sales volume above breakeven volume of sales and use the product to
               help sell other products in the productmix.

               Leasing:


               Leasing which is an alternative to selling capital goods is a common thing in industrial
               marketing. Basically, leasing is an arrangement between the leasing firm or the lessor
               and the user or the lessee, the former arranging to purchase the capital equipment for
               the use of the latter. The lessee has to pay the lessor in the form of rentals and the
               lessor remains owner of the equipment during the specified period.

               There are four types of leases, which are explained below.

               1. Operating lease: Operating Lease refers to a short-term lease of an asset for an hour,
               a day etc.

               2. Financial Lease: The financial lease is for a basic term during which the lease is non-
               cancellable. The length of this basic period is determined primarily by the economic life
               of the asset, and is usually shorter than the expected life. This arrangement provides
               some means by which the company may continue to use the asset after the expiry of
               the basic lease period, or alternatively a market purchase price is negotiated on the
               lease termination.

               3. The sale and lease back transaction: The sale and lease back transaction provides
               for an arrangement by which an entity that owns a given asset may sell it to the leasing
               company, and lease it back. This enables the lessee to immediately defreeze the
               money that it had locked into the original asset, which becomes available to it for
               working capital or further expansion.


               4. Leveraged lease: Leveraged lease is an arrangement where two or more lessors may
               jointly acquire the asset and lease it to the lessee. This is so in case of very large

                Lesson Proper: Nature and Function of Distribution


               What is the nature and function of distribution (place)?


               Distribution is efficiently managing the acquisition of raw materials by the factory and
               the movement of products from the producer or manufacturer to business-to-business
               (B2B) users and consumers.  It includes many facets, such as location, hours, website
               presence, logistics, atmospherics, inventory management, supply-chain management,
               and others. Logistics activities are usually the responsibility of the marketing department
               and are part of the large series of activities included in the supply chain. A supply chain
               is the system through which an organization acquires raw material, produces products,
               and delivers the products and services to its customers. Figure below illustrates a
               typical supply chain. Supply chain management helps increase the efficiency of logistics

               ultimate users.

               On their way from producers to end users and consumers, products pass through a
               series of marketing entities known as a distribution channel. We will look first at the
               entities that make up a distribution channel and then examine the functions that
               channels serve.

                                Marketing Intermediaries in the Distribution Channel


               A distribution channel is made up of marketing intermediaries, or organizations that
               assist in moving goods and services from producers to end users and consumers.
               Marketing intermediaries are in the middle of the distribution process, between the
               producer and the end user. The following marketing intermediaries most often appear in
               the distribution channel:




                   •  Agents and brokers: Agents are sales representatives of manufacturers and
                       wholesalers, and brokers are entities that bring buyers and sellers together. Both
                       agents and brokers are usually hired on commission basis by either a buyer or a
                       seller. Agents and brokers are go-betweens whose job is to make deals. They do
                       not own or take possession of goods.
                   •  Industrial distributors: Industrial distributors are independent wholesalers that
                       buy related product lines from many manufacturers and sell them to industrial
                       users. They often have a sales force to call on purchasing agents, make
                       deliveries, extend credit, and provide information. Industrial distributors are used
                       in such industries as aircraft manufacturing, mining, and petroleum.
                   •  Wholesalers: Wholesalers are firms that sell finished goods to retailers,
                       manufacturers, and institutions (such as schools and hospitals). Historically, their
                       function has been to buy from manufacturers and sell to retailers.
                   •  Retailers: Retailers are firms that sell goods to consumers and to industrial
                       users for their own consumption.

               A Typical Supply Chain


















                                                            - 29 -]]></page><page Index="118"><![CDATA[At the end of the distribution channel are final consumers and industrial users. Industrial
               users are firms that buy products for internal use or for producing other products or
               services. They include manufacturers, utilities, airlines, railroads, and service institutions
               such as hotels, hospitals, and schools.


               Figure below shows various ways marketing intermediaries can be linked. For
               instance, a manufacturer may sell to a wholesaler that sells to a retailer that in turn sells
               to a customer. In any of these distribution systems, goods and services are physically
               transferred from one organization to the next. As each takes possession of the
               products, it may take legal ownership of them. As the exhibit indicates, distribution
               channels can handle either consumer products or industrial products.

               Channels of Distribution for B2B and Consumer Products




























                                                            - 30 -]]></page><page Index="119"><![CDATA[Nontraditional Channels

               Often nontraditional channel arrangements help differentiate a firm’s product from the
               competition. For example, manufacturers may decide to use nontraditional channels
               such as the internet, mail-order channels, or infomercials to sell products instead of
               going through traditional retailer channels. Although nontraditional channels may limit a
               brand’s coverage, they can give a producer serving a niche market a way to gain
               market access and customer attention without having to establish channel
               intermediaries. Nontraditional channels can also provide another avenue of sales for
               larger firms. For example, a London publisher sells short stories through vending
               machines in the London Underground. Instead of the traditional book format, the stories
               are printed like folded maps, making them an easy-to-read alternative for commuters.

               Kiosks, long a popular method for ordering and registering for wedding gifts, dispersing
               cash through ATMs, and facilitating airline check-in, are finding new uses. Ethan
               Allen furniture stores use kiosks as a product locator tool for consumers and

               for classes, see their class schedule and grades, check account balances, and even
               print transcripts. The general public, when it has access to the kiosks, can use them to
               gather information about the university.


                                    Channels Reduce the Number of Transactions



               Channels make distribution simpler by reducing the number of transactions required to
               get a product from the manufacturer to the consumer. For example, if there are four
               students in a course and a professor requires five textbooks (each from a different
               publisher), a total of 20 transactions would be necessary to accomplish the sale of the
               books. If the bookstore serves as a go-between, the number of transactions is reduced
               to nine. Each publisher sells to one bookstore rather than to four students. Each student
               buys from one bookstore instead of from five publishers see Figure below.


               How Distribution Channels Reduce the Number of Transactions

               distribution activity. Producers are traditionally not as efficient or as enthusiastic about
               selling products directly to end users as channel members are. First, producers may
               wish to focus on production. They may feel that they cannot both produce and distribute
               in a competitive way. On the other hand, manufacturers are eager to deal directly with
               giant retailers, such as Walmart, which offer huge sales opportunities to producers.


                                           Channels Ease the Flow of Goods


               Channels make distribution easier in several ways. The first is by sorting, which consists
               of the following:


            •  Sorting out: Breaking many different items into separate stocks that are similar. Eggs,
               for instance, are sorted by grade and size. Another example would be different lines of
               women’s dresses—designer, moderate, and economy lines.

            •  Accumulating: Bringing similar stocks together into a larger quantity. Twelve large
               Grade A eggs could be placed in some cartons and 12 medium Grade B eggs in other
               cartons. Another example would be to merge several lines of women’s dresses from
               different designers together.
            •  Allocating: Breaking similar products into smaller and smaller lots. (Allocating at the
               wholesale level is called breaking bulk.) For instance, a tank-car load of milk could be
               broken down into gallon jugs. The process of allocating generally is done when the
               goods are dispersed by region and as ownership of the goods changes.
               Without the sorting, accumulating, and allocating processes, modern society would not
               exist. Instead, there would be home-based industries providing custom or semicustom
               products to local markets. In short, society would return to a much lower level of
               consumption.
               A second way channels ease the flow of goods is by locating buyers for merchandise. A
               wholesaler must find the right retailers to sell a profitable volume of merchandise. A
               sporting-goods wholesaler, for instance, must find the retailers who are most likely to
               reach sporting-goods consumers. Retailers have to understand the buying habits of
               consumers and put stores where consumers want and expect to find the merchandise.
               Every member of a distribution channel must locate buyers for the products it is trying to
               sell.

               Channel members also store merchandise so that goods are available when consumers
               want to buy them. The high cost of retail space often means many goods are stored by
               the wholesaler or manufacturer.

            2.  Provide an example of a strategic channel alliance.

               Introduction to Business Communication

               We focus on communication within the organization and do not say much about external
               communication (advertising, public relations, etc.). But all the principles we discuss do
               apply to both internal and external communication. For example, we emphasize the
               importance of understanding how different audiences may have very different
               perspectives on the same message; we emphasize the importance of clear language;
               and we emphasize the importance of careful planning and a clear strategy in formal
               communication.

               COMMUNICATION WORKING WELL


               In the Preface, we referred to research which shows the importance and benefits of
               ‘improved internal communication’. If good communication is so important and can offer
               such tangible benefits, then why can we find so many examples where it does not seem
               to work effectively? Why do so many organizations seem to ignore the research into the
               practice of leading companies which have a reputation for effective communication?
               This research consistently highlights the following factors (based on research
               summarized by Tourish, 1997, and by Robbins, 1998, pp. 325ff.).

               Management commitment

               Senior management must be committed to the importance of communication and must
               act accordingly. Robbins regards this as the most significant factor: if the senior
               executive is able and willing to communicate his or her vision of the organization and
               regularly communicates face to face with employees, then this will set the expected
               standard for other managers. Of course, these other levels of management must also
               share that commitment. And managers must also act in ways which confirm their
               communication. This commitment by management must also extend to training.
               Communication training is given a high priority and is well supported.

               Two-way communication

               There must be an effective balance between downward and upward communication.
               Tourish highlights the importance of regular surveys of employee opinion, which must
               then lead to action plans and visible results.


               Face-to-face communication

               Wherever possible, communication is delivered face to face. This obviously allows for
               immediate feedback and discussion.

               Management recognizes what information their employees need to have and make sure
               that they receive it in the most appropriate form.

               Communication Fundamentals


               Effective managers and professionals in all walks of life . . . have to become skilled in
               the art of ‘reading’ the situations that they are attempting to organize or manage.
               (Morgan, 1997, p. 3)

               The same remark can also be applied to communication. But we suggest that everyone
               in the organization needs to develop the skills of understanding and interpreting the
               messages and meanings they encounter. This ‘reading’ is not necessarily a
               straightforward process. Morgan talks of the need to ‘develop deep appreciations of the
               situations’ (p. 3). We also suggest that you need to develop a ‘deep appreciation’ of the
               communication which characterizes your organization – and this involves understanding
               what communication means and how it works.



                Lesson Proper: Advertising in Marketing Communication


               Role of Advertising in Marketing Communication


               Marketing communications are the means by which organizations attempt to inform,
               persuade, and remind consumers about products, services, or brands. Marketing
               communications inform and make consumers aware about the availability of the product
               or service, about its usage, price and special offers. Marketing Communications attempt
               to persuade potential consumers to purchase and try the product. Marketing
               communications can also be used to reinforce experiences, or to remind consumers
               about their needs and their past experiences related to the product with a view to
               convince them for repurchases. Marketing communication also differentiate products in
               markets where there is little to separate competing products and brands.

               Advertising is a paid form of a non-personal message communicated through the
               various media by industry, business firms, nonprofit organizations, or individuals.
               Advertising is persuasive and informational and is designed to influence the purchasing
               behavior and/or thought patterns of the audience.

               The advertising message has to reach a billion people, speaking different languages,
               practicing many religions. Advertisers can reach their audiences through television,

               Hence, advertising is a form of mass communication.

               Process of Advertising

               Following are the steps that are required to be followed for development and execution
               of advertising:


               Briefing - Advertising process starts with briefing - a document confirming understanding
               between client and advertising agency on - what product to advertise, objective of
               advertising, time-frame of ad campaign, strategies to reach the audience, and total
               estimated cost.

               Market Research - After briefing market research will done. Research includes -
               comparison of advertiser's product or service with competitor's product or service,
               consumers' perception of their brand in comparison to their competitors, study of
               competitors' advertising, and response of consumers to competitors' advertising.

               Identify Target Audience - Next step is to identify target audience. Using the market
               research, the advertising agency will identify the target audience.

               Media Selection - Using the research, the advertising agency or the media agency will
               select the media that should be used to reach the target audience in the most cost-
               effective way.

               Ad Designing & Ad Creation - At this step the creative people of advertising agency will
               convert the advertising communication into words and pictures. The copywriter will write
               the copy of advertising and the art director will visually implement the copywriter's
               message. The advertising agency may get the filming or taping done by outside
               production companies.


               Decide Place & Time - This step is to decide where and when the advertisement will be
               shown. Traffic department within the advertising agency will ensure that the
               commercials are ready on time and all required legal approvals have been granted.

               Execution - Finally the advertisement will be executed.

               Performance Check - Once the advertisement is executed, the media agency will check
               its performance.

               Segmentation, Targeting and Positioning (STP) Model
               What Is the STP Process in Marketing?


               Sofia has just started a new job as a marketing manager for a fashion outlet. She
               conducts a careful analysis of sales data within the first few weeks, and quickly
               identifies a profitable opportunity with a particular group of high-value customers.


                                                            - 37 -]]></page><page Index="126"><![CDATA[So, she brainstorms several ideas with her team, and they come up with an exciting
               new product which has the potential to be a real success for the company.

               Sofia has identified a profitable segment of the market, but how has she done it? How
               can her team members develop a perfect product for these people? And how should
               they communicate its benefits?

               We'll look at the Segmentation, Targeting and Positioning (STP) Model*, an approach
               that you can use to identify your most valuable market segments, and then sell to
               them successfully with carefully targeted products and marketing.




               Examples of Targeting in Marketing

               The STP Model consists of three steps that help you analyze your offering and the way
               you communicate its benefits and value to specific groups.


               STP stands for:

               •  Step 1: Segment your market.
               •  Step 2: Target your best customers.
               •  Step 3: Position your offering.


               This model is useful because it helps you identify your most valuable types of customer,
               and then develop products and marketing messages that ideally suit them. This allows
               you to engage with each group better, personalize your messages, and sell much more
               of your product.

               Example
               Marriott International® owns a number of different hotel chains that target specific
               consumer groups.


               For example, Courtyard by Marriott® hotels focus on travelers on the road, who want a
               nice, clean place to stay during their trip; Ritz-Carlton® hotels target those who don't
               mind paying a premium for luxury; and Marriott ExecuStay® hotels are aimed at
               professionals who need a longer-term, comfortable place to stay.


               As you can imagine, Marriott International doesn't communicate the same marketing
               message to all its customers. Each hotel is designed and positioned to appeal to the
               unique wants and needs of a specific group.







                                                            - 38 -]]></page><page Index="127"><![CDATA[Applying the STP Model


               Follow the steps below to apply the STP Model in your organization.



               Step 1: Segment Your Market

               Your organization, product or brand can't be all things to all people. This is why you
               need to use market segmentation  to divide your customers into groups of people with
               common characteristics and needs. This allows you to tailor your approach to meet
               each group's needs cost-effectively, and this gives you a huge advantage over
               competitors who use a "one size fits all" approach.


               There are many different ways to segment your target markets. For example, you can
               use the following approaches:


               •  Demographic – By personal attributes such as age, marital status, gender, ethnicity,
                   sexuality, education, or occupation.
               •  Geographic – By country, region, state, city, or neighborhood.
               •  Psychographic – By personality, risk aversion, values, or lifestyle.
               •  Behavioral – By how people use the product, how loyal they are, or the benefits that
                   they are looking for.

               Example
                   •  The Adventure Travel Company is an online travel agency that organizes
                       worldwide adventure vacations. It has split its customers into three segments,
                       because it's too costly to create different packages for more groups than this.
                   •  Segment A is made up of young married couples, who are primarily interested in
                       affordable, eco-friendly vacations in exotic locations. Segment B consists of
                       middle-class families, who want safe, family-friendly vacation packages that
                       make it easy and fun to travel with children. Segment C comprises upscale
                       retirees, who are looking for stylish and luxurious vacations in well-known
                       locations such as Paris and Rome.



               Step 2: Target Your Best Customers


               Next, you decide which segments to target by finding the most attractive ones. There
               are several factors to consider here.


               First, look at the profitability of each segment. Which customer groups contribute most
               to your bottom line?


                                                            - 39 -]]></page><page Index="128"><![CDATA[Next, analyze the size and potential growth  of each customer group. Is it large enough
               to be worth addressing? Is steady growth possible? And how does it compare with the
               other segments? (Make sure that you won't be reducing revenue by shifting your focus
               to a niche market that's too small.)
               Last, think carefully about how well your organization can service this market. For
               example, are there any legal, technological or social barriers that could have an impact?


               Example
               The Adventure Travel Company analyzes the profits, revenue and market size of each
               of its segments. Segment A has profits of $8,220,000, Segment B has profits of
               $4,360,000, and Segment C has profits of $3,430,000. So, it decides to focus on
               Segment A, after confirming that the segment size is big enough (it's estimated to be
               worth $220,000,000/year.)



               Step 3: Position Your Offering

               In this last step, your goal is to identify how you want to position your product to target
               the most valuable customer segments. Then, you can select the marketing mix  that will
               be most effective for each of them.
               First, consider why customers should purchase your product rather than those of your
               competitors. Do this by identifying your unique selling proposition , and draw
               a positioning map  to understand how each segment perceives your product, brand or
               service. This will help you determine how best to position you’re offering.
               Next, look at the wants and needs of each segment, or the problem that your product
               solves for these people. Create a value proposition  that clearly explains how your
               offering will meet this requirement better than any of your competitors' products, and
               then develop a marketing campaign that presents this value proposition in a way that
               your audience will appreciate.



               Example
               The Adventure Travel Company markets itself as the "best eco-vacation service for
               young married couples" (Segment A).


               It hosts a competition on Instagram® and Pinterest® to reach its desired market,
               because these are the channels that these people favor. It asks customers to send in
               interesting pictures of past eco-vacations, and the best one wins an all-inclusive trip.


               The campaign goes viral and thousands of people send in their photos, which helps
               build the Adventure Travel Company mailing list. The company then creates a monthly
               e-newsletter full of eco-vacation destination profiles.

               The STP Model helps you position a product or service to target different groups of
               customers more efficiently. This three-step approach helps you quickly zoom in on the
               most profitable parts of your business, so that you can fully exploit the opportunities
               these offer.


               To use the model, start by segmenting your market into groups. Next, choose which of
               these you want to target. Last, identify how you want to position your product, based on
               the personality and behavior of your target market.

               Strategic planning in industrial setting

               What is Strategic Planning?


               Strategic planning is the art of creating specific business strategies, implementing them,
               and evaluating the results of executing the plan, in regard to a company’s overall long-
               term goals or desires. It is a concept that focuses on integrating various departments
               (such as accounting and finance, marketing, and human resources) within a company to













































                                                            - 41 -]]></page><page Index="130"><![CDATA[accomplish its strategic goals. The term strategic planning is essentially synonymous
               with strategic management.

               The concept of strategic planning originally became popular in the 1950s and 1960s,
               and enjoyed favor in the corporate world up until the 1980s, when it somewhat fell out of
               favor. However, enthusiasm for strategic business planning was revived in the 1990s
               and strategic planning remains relevant in modern business.

               Strategic Planning Process


               The strategic planning process requires considerable thought and planning on the part
               of a company’s upper-level management. Before settling on a plan of action and then
               determining how to strategically implement it, executives may consider many possible
               options. In the end, a company’s management will, hopefully, settle on a strategy that is
               most likely to produce positive results (usually defined as improving the company’s
               bottom line) and that can be executed in a cost-efficient manner with a high likelihood of
               success, while avoiding undue financial risk.


               The development and execution of strategic planning are typically viewed as consisting
               of being performed in three critical steps:


               1. Strategy Formulation

               In the process of formulating a strategy, a company will first assess its current situation
               by performing an internal and external audit. The purpose of this is to help identify the
               organization’s strengths and weaknesses, as well as opportunities and threats (SWOT
               Analysis). As a result of the analysis, managers decide on which plans or markets they
               should focus on or abandon, how to best allocate the company’s resources, and
               whether to take actions such as expanding operations through a joint venture or merger.


               Business strategies have long-term effects on organizational success. Only upper
               management executives are usually authorized to assign the resources necessary for
               their implementation.


               2. Strategy Implementation

               After a strategy is formulated, the company needs to establish specific targets or goals
               related to putting the strategy into action, and allocate resources for the strategy’s
               execution. The success of the implementation stage is often determined by how good a
               job upper management does in regard to clearly communicating the chosen strategy
               throughout the company and getting all of its employees to “buy into” the desire to put
               the strategy into action.







                                                            - 42 -]]></page><page Index="131"><![CDATA[Effective strategy implementation involves developing a solid structure, or framework,
               for implementing the strategy, maximizing the utilization of relevant resources, and
               redirecting marketing efforts in line with the strategy’s goals and objectives.


               3. Strategy Evaluation

               Any savvy business person knows that success today does not guarantee success
               tomorrow. As such, it is important for managers to evaluate the performance of a
               chosen strategy after the implementation phase. Strategy evaluation involves three
               crucial activities: reviewing the internal and external factors affecting the implementation
               of the strategy, measuring performance, and taking corrective steps to make the
               strategy more effective. For example, after implementing a strategy to improve
               customer service, a company may discover that it needs to adopt a new customer
               relationship management (CRM) software program in order to attain the desired
               improvements in customer relations.


               All three steps in strategic planning occur within three hierarchical levels: upper
               management, middle management, and operational levels. Thus, it is imperative to
               foster communication and interaction among employees and managers at all levels, so
               as to help the firm to operate as a more functional and effective team.

               Benefits of Strategic Planning


               The volatility of the business environment causes many firms to adopt reactive
               strategies rather than proactive ones. However, reactive strategies are typically only
               viable for the short-term, even though they may require spending a significant amount of
               resources and time to execute. Strategic planning helps firms prepare proactively and
               address issues with a more long-term view. They enable a company to initiate influence
               instead of just responding to situations.


               Among the primary benefits derived from strategic planning are the following:


               1. Helps formulate better strategies using a logical, systematic approach

               This is often the most important benefit. Some studies show that the strategic planning
               process itself makes a significant contribution to improving a company’s overall
               performance, regardless of the success of a specific strategy.

               2. Enhanced communication between employers and employees


               Communication is crucial to the success of the strategic planning process. It is initiated
               through participation and dialogue among the managers and employees, which shows
               their commitment to achieving organizational goals.


               Strategic planning also helps managers and employees show commitment to the
               organization’s goals. This is because they know what the company is doing and the

                                                            - 43 -]]></page><page Index="132"><![CDATA[reasons behind it. Strategic planning makes organizational goals and objectives real,
               and employees can more readily understand the relationship between their
               performance, the company’s success, and compensation. As a result, both employees
               and managers tend to become more innovative and creative, which fosters further
               growth of the company.

               3. Empowers individuals working in the organization


               The increased dialogue and communication across all stages of the process
               strengthens employees’ sense of effectiveness and importance in the company’s overall
               success. For this reason, it is important for companies to decentralize the strategic
               planning process by involving lower-level managers and employees throughout the
               organization. A good example is that of the Walt Disney Co., which dissolved its
               separate strategic planning department, in favor of assigning the planning roles to
               individual Disney business divisions.


               The Top 6 Steps of Strategic Planning


               Building an internal, long-term strategic plan for the business, that is going to guide
               management with its decision making, is different.  It is a lot more detailed and can take
               months to create.  Here are the top six key components for building a killer strategic
               plan for your business.




               1.  Assess Industry, Competitor & Customer Trends


               The first step of any strategic planning starts with studying the overall market in which
               you are operating.  How big is the industry?  How quick is it growing?  Who are the key
               competitors?  How well funded are they?  What moves are they making?  What are
               pricing trends? What products or services are your customers asking for?  Any macro-
               economic trends at play?  Any government regulation issues?  You cannot set an
               effective plan for your business unless you truly understand what you are up against
               from an industry and competition perspective.  Think about this as an "external"
               evaluation of overall market trends that impact your business.

               2.  Complete a SWOT Analysis on Your Business


               A SWOT analysis critically evaluates your company's Strengths, Weaknesses,

               prices, etc. Think about this as an "internal" evaluation of your business.


               3.  Define Your Mission and Vision

               Once the external and internal evaluation is done, you are in a good position to begin
               crafting your high-level mission statement and vision statement.  Your mission
               statement speaks to "why do we exist?"  Something like "our mission is to replace
               expensive offline market research with equal quality insights from social listening".  Your
               vision statement speaks to "what are we offering and where are we heading".  And all
               good vision statements should be quantifiable and Timebound.  Something like "We
               plan on driving $50MM in revenues from our industry-leading social listening platform
               within 3 years".  These are the "North Star" statements that will guide all detailed
               decisions from there.


               4.  Define Your Corporate Business Goals

               Once you know where you are heading, at the 30,000 foot view, and what you are up
               against from an industry and competition perspective, now you are in a position to start
               drilling down into specific business goals that will enable you to achieve that
               vision.  Your goals are the specific outcomes you are trying to achieve.  This could
               include things like changes to product offering, sales & marketing strategies, financial
               resources, operational efficiency, employee culture, financial targets and beyond. What
               high level things need to happen to make your vision a reality.



               5.  Drill Down to Department Level Objectives


               As we continue to "peel back the layers of the onion", now we need to decide what
               specific objectives and initiatives do we need to implement to help the company achieve
               each of its business goals.  This is typically done department-by-department within the
               company--setting specific objectives for the product team, sales & marketing,
               operations, technology, finance and human resources.  For example, a business goal
               might be "improve company morale" and a specific objective of the HR department to
               support that goal might be "launch new employee benefits".  You should limit all
               department-level goals to the handful of items that the department can rally around in
               any one year.  And, these objectives needs to be made SMART--Specific, Measurable,
               Achievable, Results-Focused and Timebound.


               6.  Determine Staffing, Budget and Financing Needs

               Once all the departmental needs have been defined and quantified, now you are able to
               aggregate them up into one centralized corporate plan, organizational structure and

               have one of two choices:  (i) lower your targets to a level you can more easily afford; or
               (ii) raise the capital required for you to achieve your full plan.



               Strategic planning process within business units


               Markets are diverse, and strategies need to be tailored to individual markets. In this
               respect, a company is often divided into business units according to its different
               products in order to develop and follow a specific strategy. Consequently, these are
               called strategic business units (SBUs) and they are based on three characteristics

               (Kotler & Keller, 2009). An SBU:

                   •  is a single business (product), or a collection of related businesses (products),

                       that can be planned separately from the rest of the company
                   •  has its own defined market (with customers, competitors etc.)
                   •  has a manager responsible for strategic planning and profit performance.


               Once a company has defined its SBUs, management has to decide how the budget
               needs to be allocated. Each SBU must therefore be assessed according to its value,
               which is based on potential growth opportunities.


               A review of opportunities for improving existing businesses can be performed within the
               framework of Ansoff's product-market expansion grid. Based on current products and
               markets, a company must assess whether it could gain a higher market share (better
               market penetration) or needs to explore new markets (market development) for its
               current products. New markets may be new customer segments or international
               markets, for example. The second consideration focuses on new products and whether
               they can be offered in the existing markets (product development) and/or should be
               offered to new markets. When approaching markets in other countries especially, a
               certain degree of product adjustment is required to suit the local context (language,
               legal issues etc.).

               SWOT analysis


               A successful business activity is built on the company's core competences. The SWOT
               analysis is a popular concept to conduct an overall evaluation of a company's strengths
               (S), weaknesses (W) - the internal environment - and opportunities (O) and threats (T) -
               the external environment. Based on contrasting the company's strengths and
               weaknesses with market opportunities and (potential) threats, it gives recommendations

               for actions in the resulting cells.

               Goal and strategy formulation


               Goals are set to define what is important to achieve. Within an organization there is a
               series of goals of different kinds and on different levels. The goals that concern the most
               important company relations, or the company as a whole, are strategic goals and they
               are usually developed over several years.


               Examples of (generic) goals: maximize sales revenue; maximize market share;
               maximize market value of the company's products (in their segments); maximize brand
               loyalty.


               Definition: Goals


               All companies have ways of working to achieve a particular goal. Sometimes, this goal
               arises from the company's historical operations; sometimes it is a goal that someone
               has decided upon and directs the company.


               When conducting management by objectives, there are four relevant criteria:


                   •  Objectives must be arranged hierarchically, from the most to the least important.
                   •  Objectives should be quantitative whenever possible.
                   •  Goals should be realistic.
                   •  Objectives must be consistent (for example, sales and profit cannot be
                       maximized simultaneously).


               The next step is to form a strategy that will provide methods of achieving particular
               goals. A strategy is a framework for action; it channels all programmes and activities
               according to the defined goals, often in the form of a plan. A well-developed strategy
               works as both a guide and an aid for the distribution of resources, identification of
               needs, changes in the organization etc. At this level you define the company's basic
               orientation and create guidelines for implementing what you want to do.


               The content of a strategy is also decided by its relationship with its environment.
               Competitive strategies are influenced by factors such as current competition, access to
               different markets, trade barriers, power relations, legal and institutional standards and



                                                            - 48 -]]></page><page Index="137"><![CDATA[laws etc. The dynamic nature of the company environment requires strategies to be
               reviewed continuously to see whether they remain appropriate for achieving specific
               goals.


               In summary, a strategy describes how the organization will act on a general level in
               order to handle these factors and to achieve its long-term goals. As you can see, there
               is a causal relationship between goals and strategies. Put simply, one could also say

               that every company should focus on strategic planning, because 'failing to plan means
               planning to fail'.

               Definition: Strategy


               Another perspective is given by comparing your company with your most important
               competitors. In principle, there are three basic strategies to follow:


                   •  Cost leadership - 'being cheaper than ...'
                   •  Differentiation - 'being different from ...'
                   •  Concentration/focus - 'being narrower/more specialized than ...'.
















               Figure 5. Porter's generic strategies (adapted from Porter, 1980, 1985; in Kotler &
               Keller, 2009).



               The core difference lies between having cost superiority and one of the other two
               strategies. Concentration is built on the same basic elements as differentiation, but
               focuses on specific niche markets or segments as compared to a whole industry. Thus,
               the company's products target only a small number of segments within a few sectors or
               markets.

               Strategies only work if they are implemented appropriately. Practicable programmed
               must be therefore formulated. If the strategy is to attain technological leadership for the
               development of specific products, then programmed must be devised to strengthen
               research and development (R&D), production, and processing units in the company.
               Similar requirements apply to marketing programmes in which the effectiveness of its

               tools (product, price, place, promotion) needs to be evaluated and adjusted if
               necessary.

               Programmes can be related to several elements. One example is provided by Peters

               and Waterman (former employees at McKinsey & Company) who distinguished
               between a company's 'hardware' elements (the 'bones': strategy, (organizational)
               structure, and (information and communication) systems), and 'software' elements (the
               'blood': (leadership) style, skills (competencies), staff, and shared values (culture)).


               Feedback and control


               This final aspect emphasizes the need for constant evaluation of the company's
               strategic fit with the market and further environmental dynamics.

               What does Marketing Efficiency mean?


               Marketing efficiency is total revenue expressed as a percentage of total marketing costs
               including promotion, product development and sales expressed as a percentage of
               revenue.




               Learn the Concept and Indicators of Marketing Efficiency.


               The strong form of marketing efficiency or market efficiency essentially proclaims that it
               is impossible to consistently outperform the market, particularly in the short term,
               because it is impossible to predict stock prices. If you’re not measuring your marketing
               efficiency, your marketing is going to suffer, but marketing efficiency is only the
               beginning what matters most is identifying the pieces of data that can make a difference
               in driving your marketing strategy.

               is the claim that analysts and professional advisors add little or no value to portfolios,
               especially mutual fund managers (with the notable exception of those managing funds
               that take on greater risks), and that professionally managed portfolios do not
               consistently outperform randomly selected portfolios with equivalent risk characteristics.



               Definition of Marketing Efficiency:



               Fred Waugh remarked that,

               “An unsophisticated student might make two false assumptions, first, that is it easy to define and
               to measure the efficiency of agricultural marketing and, second, that almost everyone is in favor
               of efficiency.”



               As well as, Definition of Market Efficiency:



               The elements of market efficiency can be stated as follows:


                   •  Competition and the number of market participants: Greater the number of
                       buyers and sellers participating in the transactions or greater the competition, the
                       market efficiency increases.
                   •  Transfer of ownership and the balance of market power: The party which has
                       greater knowledge has the greater power over deciding the terms of sale i.e. the
                       terms of transfer of ownership. In an efficient market, both parties are well
                       equipped with information so that the balance of power is easily maintained.
                   •  The efficiency of price formation: Efficient pricing of products occurs when a
                       large number of buyers and sellers take part in the transaction and possess the
                       same information about the market.



               The formula of Marketing Efficiency:


                               Marketing Efficiency = (Revenue / Marketing cost) x 100



               For example, a firm with revenue of $2 billion dollars with total marketing costs of $250
               million has the marketing efficiency of marketing efficiency = (2000/250) x 100 = 800%

               non-marketing costs such as the unit costs of your products. However, it serves as a
               useful benchmark and metric for measuring improvement to your marketing results.



               Indicators of Marketing Efficiency:



               Due to the non-availability of standard efficiency criteria, the following indicators are
               sometimes identified with marketing efficiency.


                   A.  Marketing margins.
                   B.  Consumer price.
                   C.  Availability of physical marketing facilities, and.
                   D.  Market competition.



               A. Market Margins:



               In most cases, high marketing margins are regarded as prima facie evidence of gross
               inefficiency in marketing, and the middlemen who are blamed for being either inefficient,
               too numerous, or too monopolistic, are most often regarded as the major cause of high
               marketing margins. Whether high marketing margins, necessarily imply inefficiency in
               marketing must be analyzed in light of the following considerations.



                   •  Firstly, marketing margins will appear high in relation to Production costs of a
                       commodity in any country or region in which those production costs are
                       themselves quite low. The use of modern technology, which prodigiously lower
                       costs of production, exhibits a magnifying effect on any given distributive margin.
                   •  Secondly, the extreme geographic specialization of production (especially in the
                       developed countries) has resulted in a considerable increase in the cost of
                       providing the ‘lace utility of farm goods. This, in turn, has served to increase
                       transport costs and, therefore, marketing margins. But this may imply that
                       opportunity costs of production are so low in areas far from the market that the
                       low costs of production more than offset the high costs of marketing.
                   •  Thirdly, the increased amount of time utility embodied in food products (both
                       perishable and non-perishable) has required extra storage and processing costs
                       for their orderly marketing.
                   •  Fourthly, in all developed countries (and in a good number of developing
                       countries, too) considerable changes have occurred with respect to farm utility of
                       farm products. Consumers today are increasingly demanding that their food and
                       agricultural non-food requirements be met in more and more finished form. This
                       has tended to multiply marketing margins, especially in developed countries.




                                                            - 52 -]]></page><page Index="141"><![CDATA[•  Finally, the high labor costs, especially in the retail trades, which are a special
                       feature of the developed countries also contribute to high marketing. Self-Service
                       shopping, which has gained considerable momentum in recent years, endeavors
                       to minimize the impact of high labor costs, but it is not a magical device to reduce
                       the overall costs to a significant extent. It merely eliminates the small fraction of
                       the costs due to those retail services that come to be performed mainly by the
                       consumer.



               The major marketing costs are those which result due to enhanced improved utilities of
               form time and place. They represent the costs of the services which the consumer
               demands and for which he is willing to pay. In view of the above consideration, it could
               be safely concluded that distributive margins which form a longer and larger share of
               food expenditure have not been inconsistent with efficient marketing in the developed
               countries. In fact, these marketing margins have been a sine qua non for an effective
               marketing system in developed countries.



               What follows from the above illustration is that the size and composition of marketing
               margins can be used as a useful measure of efficiency, but to use it effectively requires
               an extremely sensitive weighing balance. The size of margin cannot be related to
               anything else until it is accurately related to the quantum and type of services yielded by
               it. Let us analyze this aspect briefly.



               Marketing margin consists of two elements:

                   1.  Explicit costs paid for the performance of various marketing functions, and.
                   2.  The profit of the market intermediaries.



               1. The Cost Component:



               The costs in marketing are incurred in the performance of various marketing functions of
               assembling, transportation, storage, processing, etc. or in other words, in the creation of
               various utilities. In order to minimize costs, the marketing facilities should operate at the
               maximum possible capacities with the least possible losses of produce.



               We can decide whether the costs prevailing in the marketing system have any
               economic justification only after we have analyzed the following factors:



                   •  The intensity of competition, especially in light of various state policies.
                   •  The extent of utilization of the capacity of marketing facilities.
                   •  The quantum and nature of services rendered in creating time, place and form
                       utilities.

               2. The Profit Component:


               The subject of marketing profit has been rather extensively covered in the marketing
               literature of the developing countries. There are more abuses than appreciations
               attached to this subject. It is usually stated that the profit element predominates in the
               aggregate margin on agricultural commodities as a result of certain superfluous or
               inefficient intermediaries in the existing marketing channels.



               Most of the studies relating to this topic do not, however, endeavor to quantify the cost
               of various direct and indirect services rendered by the intermediaries. Much of what is
               called profit, in fact, reflects middlemen costs.



               For instance, studies of middlemen profit in the developing countries usually tend to
               ignore the following cost, items:


                   •  The cost on the money loaned out by the intermediary to farmers, consumers, or
                       other intermediaries;
                   •  The cost of risks and uncertainties borne by the middleman in agricultural trade;
                   •  The cost of social help extended to the farmers;
                   •  The cost of entertainment at his business premises;
                   •  The cost due to spoilage of produce; and
                   •  The cost for bribes or gifts and for some kinds of levies, taxes and service charge
                       not in fact related to the actual services provided.



               In order to arrive at the real profit figures, the cost of these and other indirect services
               has to be quantified. In determining the economic justification of various
               intermediaries, the following factors would be carefully analyzed:



                   •  The intensity of competition at all grade levels.
                   •  The number of risks and uncertainties involved.
                   •  The size of the business.
                   •  Alternative employment opportunities in society.
                   •  Restrictive state policies.

               Rising consumer prices are usually regarded as a measure of market inefficiency.
               But the price of any commodity is a function of:


                   •  Consumer income.
                   •  Available supplies in relation to effective demand.
                   •  Money supply.
                   •  Prices of substitutes and complements.
                   •  Seasonal factors.
                   •  Marketing margins and distributional patterns.
                   •  State price policies, and.
                   •  General Price level.



               Increase in consumer prices is commonly attributed to manipulation by middlemen
               artificially restricting the distribution of commodities to their own advantage or creating
               artificial scarcities in the distribution of commodities. Actually, most marketing costs are
               relatively sticky and tend to change very slightly as compared to price changes caused
               by other factors.


               Even when deficiencies in the distributional patterns affect the price structure, they are
               usually caused by state price and procurement policies. High consumer prices are,
               therefore., largely due to factors other than marketing inefficiencies, although marketing
               often becomes the scapegoat for ills it has not directly caused.


               C. Physical Marketing Facilities:



               The inadequacy of physical marketing facilities like transport, storage, processing, etc.
               is also a subject of criticism in discussions of the efficiency of the marketing system.
               This has been common especially since the recent agricultural breakthrough in many of
               the developing countries. Although the availability of physical facilities has a direct
               bearing on marketing efficiency, to treat it as an important efficiency is questionable.



               The paucity of physical facilities may exist because of subsistence farming, the
               seasonal nature of agricultural production, the structure and wide dispersion of farm
               producing units, low quantum of marketable surplus, the stage of economic
               development, and the huge overhead expenditure involved in the provision of such
               facilities in the developing countries. Where physical facilities do exist, they are seldom
               based on a reassessment of the economic potential and requirements of the area.






                                                            - 55 -]]></page><page Index="144"><![CDATA[In the developing countries, the spatial distribution of physical marketing facilities is so
               unorganized that at certain places they are underutilized and at other over utilized.
               There is a need to determine the exact demands and patterns of distribution and the
               reallocation of existing facilities needed for their efficient use.



               D. Market Competition:



               The intensity of competition has been widely suggested as a major indicator of market
               inefficiency. Though competition is desirable in itself, the methods of its measurement
               lack uniformity, precision, and objectivity. It is conventional for researchers to blame the
               policymaker in a developing country for any lack of competition.


               On the other hand, where competition is intense the researcher who considers it the key
               to efficiency is hard to put to indicate areas of possible improvement or to define relative
               degrees of efficiency. Excessive focus on quality competition is likely to be found in a
               market that lacks progressiveness and growth orientation; excessive attention to private
               competition leads towards greater concentration among sellers and the development of
               monopolistic organization with all of its attendant evils.



               Reliance on competition as a key indicator of efficiency is thus a static approach which
               disregards dynamic considerations, lacks a standard of comparison, and pays no
               attention to economic and social norms based on the value system of an economy. Use
               of competition as a measure of marketing efficiency would have to be selective and
               judicious to have any constructive influence on market performance.



               Since market performance refers to the end results of market adjustment by buyers and
               sellers in the market, the intensity of market competition may be considered both as a
               performance norm and as the net outcome of a reorganization of the market structure
               and market conduct.


               Thus the effective use of market competition as a measure of marketing efficiency
               would require an appropriate application of the criteria of workability for market
               structure, conduct and performance with all their interaction effects, so as to increase
               the intensity of competition to the extent socially desirable, while also moving towards
               such pre-designated social and economic goal.











                                                            - 56 -]]></page><page Index="145"><![CDATA[Ethical issues in marketing arise from the conflicts and lack of agreement on particular
               issues. Parties involved in marketing transactions have a set of expectations about how
               the business relationships will take shape and how various transactions need to be
               conducted. Each marketing concept has its own ethical issues, which we will discuss in
               this chapter.



               Emerging Ethical Problems in Market Research
                Market research has experienced a resurgence with the widespread use of the Internet
                and the popularity of social networking. It is easier than ever before for companies to
                connect  directly  with  customers  and  collect  individual  information  that  goes  into  a
                computer database to be matched with other pieces of data collected during unrelated
                transactions.

                The way a company conducts its market research these days can have serious ethical
                repercussions,  affecting  the  lives  of  consumers  in  ways  that  have  yet  to  be  fully
                understood.  Further,  companies  can  be  faced  with  a  public  backlash  if  their  market
                research practices are perceived as unethical.

               Grouping the Market Audience
                Unethical  practices  in  marketing  can  result  in  grouping  the  audience  into  various
                segments. Selective marketing may be used to discourage the demand arising from
                these so-called undesirable market segments or to disenfranchise them totally.
                Examples of unethical market exclusion may include the industry attitudes towards the
                gay, ethnic minority, and plus-size groups.

               Ethics in Advertising and Promotion
                In  the  early  days  of  existence  of  corporations,  especially  during  1940s  and  1950s,
                tobacco was advertised as a substance that promotes health. Of late, an advertiser who
                does not meet the ethical standards is considered an offender against morality by the
                law.
                   •  Sexuality is a major point of discussion when ethical issues in advertising content
                       are  considered.  Violence  is  also  an  important  ethical  issue  in  advertising,
                       especially where children should not be affected by the content.
                   •  Some select types of advertising may strongly offend some groups of people even
                       when they are of strong interest to others. Female hygiene products as well as
                       hemorrhoid and constipation medication are good examples. The advertisements
                       of condoms are important in the interest of AIDS-prevention, but are sometimes
                       seen  by  some  as  a  method  of  promoting  promiscuity  that  is  undesirable  and
                       strongly condemned in various societies.

                   •  A negative advertising policy lets the advertiser highlight various disadvantages of
                       the competitors’ products rather than showing the inherent advantages of their
                       own products or services. Such policies are rampant in political advertising.



                                                            - 57 -]]></page><page Index="146"><![CDATA[Delivery Channels

                Direct  marketing  is  one  of  the  most  controversial  methods  of  advertising  channels,
                especially when the approaches included are unsolicited.

                Some common examples include TV and Telephonic commercials and the direct mail.
                Electronic spam and telemarketing also push the limits of ethical standards and legality
                in a strong manner.

                Example −  Shills  and  astroturfers  are  the  best  examples  of  ways  for  delivering  a
                marketing message under the guise of independent product reviews and endorsements,
                or creating supposedly independent watchdog or review organizations. Fake reviews
                can be published on Amazon. Shills are primarily for message-delivery, but they can also
                be used to drive up prices in auctions, such as EBay auctions.
               Deceptive Marketing Policies and Ethics

                Deceptive marketing policies are not contained in a specific limit or to one target market,
                and  it  can  sometimes  go  unseen  by  the  public.  There  are  numerous  methods
                of deceptive marketing. It can be presented to consumers in various forms; one of the
                methods is one that is accomplished via the use of humor. Humor offers an escape or
                relief  from  various  types  of  human  constraints,  and  some  advertisers  may  take  the
                advantage  of  this  by  applying  deceptive  advertising  methods  for  a  product  that  can
                potentially harm or alleviate the constraints using humor.
               Anti-Competitive Practices

                There are various methods that are anti-competitive. For example, bait and switch is
                a  type  of  fraud  where  customers  are  "baited"  through  the  advertisements  for  some
                products or services that have a low price; however, the customers find in reality that the
                advertised good is unavailable and they are "switched" towards a product that is costlier
                and was not intended in the advertisements.
                Another  type  of  anti-competitive  policy  is planned  obsolescence.  It  is  a  method  of
                designing a particular product having a limited useful life. It will become non-functional
                or out of fashion after a certain period and thereby lets the consumer to purchase another
                product again.
                A pyramid scheme is also an anti-competitive process. It is a non-sustainable business
                model  that  promises  the  participants  payment  or  services,  mainly  for  enrolling  other
                people  into  the  scheme;  it  does  not  supply  any  real  investment  or  sell  products  or
                services to the public.
                This business practice demands the initial investor or the "captain" to enroll other people
                for a fee to them who again will further enroll more people in order to be paid by the
                company.

                There are various forms of unethical business practices related to pricing the products
                and services.

                Bid rigging is a type of fraud in which a commercial contract is promised to one party,
                however, for the sake of appearance several other parties also present a bid.
                Predatory pricing is the practice of sale of a product or service at a negligible price,
                intending to throw competitors out of the market, or to create barriers to entry.



                Lesson Proper: International Marketing



               International Marketing
               Definition: The International Marketing is the application of marketing principles to
               satisfy the varied needs and wants of different people residing across the national
               borders.


               Simply, the International Marketing is to undertake the marketing activities in more than
               one nation. It is often called as Global Marketing, i.e. designing the marketing mix (viz.
               Product, price, place, promotion) worldwide and customizing it according to the
               preferences of different nation people.


               The foremost decision that any company has to make is whether to go international or
               not, the company may not want to globalize because of its huge market share in the
               domestic market and do not want to learn the new laws and rules of the international
               market.


               But however, there are following reasons that attract the organization to be global:

               ▪  Huge Market Share

               ▪  Elongated life of the product
               ▪  Untapped International Market

               How to Enter the International Market?

               There are following ways through which companies can globalize:




































            1.  Exports: The easiest way to enter the market is through exports that can be indirect or
               direct. In Indirect Exports, the trading companies are involved that facilitates the buying
               and selling of goods and services abroad, on the behalf of the companies.


               Whereas in Direct exports, the company itself manages to sell the goods and services
               abroad, by opting one of the following ways:


               ▪  By setting Domestic based Export Department, working as an independent entity
               ▪  Through Overseas sales branch, that carries out the promotional activities and
                  facilitates sales and distribution.

               ▪  The sales representatives traveling abroad

                  company



            2.  Global web Strategy: Nowadays, companies need not go to the international trade
               shows to show their products, they can very well create the awareness among the
               customers worldwide through an electronic media i.e. internet.Through the company
               website, customers can read the detailed information, generally written in different
               languages, about the product and can order online.
            3.  Licensing and Franchising: One of the ways to globalize is through licensing, wherein
               the domestic company issues the license to the foreign company to use the
               manufacturing process trademark, patent, name of the domestic company while
               facilitating the sales. In licensing, the domestic company has a less control over the
               licensee.


               But, in the case of franchising, the domestic company enjoys the higher control as it
               allows the franchise to function on its behalf, and in line with the terms and conditions of
               the domestic company. MC Donalds, Dominos are the examples of franchising.


            4.  Joint Ventures: The companies can go international by joining hands with other
               country based companies with the intention to monetize their existing relationships with
               the local customers.In India, TATA AIG, HDFC standard life insurance, TATA Sky are
               the examples of joint ventures.


            5.  Direct Investment: Ultimately, the firms can establish their own business facilities or
               own a part of the local company to facilitate the sale of goods and services.


               The companies go international with the objective to have an increased sales along with
               the huge market share. But certain things such as political, social, technological, cultural
               situations should be kept in mind while designing the marketing principles since these
               are different for the different nations.

               – the buying and selling of goods through the transmission of data – which was made
               possible by the introduction of the electronic data interchange. Fast forward fifty years
               and e-commerce has changed the way in which society sells goods and services.


               E-commerce has become one of the most popular methods of making money online and
               an  attractive  opportunity  for  investors.  For  those  interested  in buying  an  e-commerce
               business,  this  article  serves  to  provide  an  introduction  to  e-commerce,  covering the
               reasons for its popularity, the main distribution models and a comparison of the major e-
               commerce platforms available.

               ‘E-commerce’ and  ‘online  shopping’ are  often  used  interchangeably  but at  its  core  e-
               commerce is much broader than this – it embodies a concept for doing business online,
               incorporating  a  multitude  of  different  services  e.g. making  online  payments,  booking
               flights etc.


               E-commerce has experienced rapid growth since its humble beginnings with e-
               commerce sales projected to grow to 599.2 billion USD by 2024. The COVID-19
               outbreak saw e-commerce sales spike 25% in March 2020 alone. The power of e-
               commerce should not be underestimated as it continues to pervade everyday life and
               present significant opportunities for small, medium, and large businesses and online
               investors. You don’t need to look far to see the potential of e-commerce
               businesses. Amazon, for example, which set the standard for customer-orientated
               websites as well as a lean supply chain, is selling over 4000 items a minute from SMBs
               alone.

               Why Do People Buy ‘Online’?


            1.  Lower Prices: Managing an online storefront is far cheaper than an offline, brick and
               mortar store. Typically less staff are required to manage an online shop as web-based
               management  systems  enable  owners  to automate  inventory  management and
               warehousing  is  not  necessarily  required  (as  we  discuss  later).  As  such,  e-commerce
               business owners can afford to pass operational cost savings on to consumers (in the form
               of product or service discounts) whilst protecting their overall margin. Furthermore, with
               the rise of price comparison websites, consumers have more transparency with regard to
               prices and are able to shop around, typically purchasing from online outlets instead.

            2.  Accessibility and Convenience: Unlike many offline stores, consumers can access e-
               commerce  websites  24  hours  a  day. Customers  can  read  about  services,  browse
               products  and  place  orders  whenever  they  wish.  In  that  sense,  online  shopping
               is extremely convenient and gives the consumer more control. Furthermore, those living
               in more remote areas are able to order from their home at a touch of a button, saving
               them time travelling to a shopping centre.

            3.  Wider Choice: For the past twenty years, the growth of online shopping has to a large
               extent been based around increased choice. With an almost endless choice of brands
               and products to choose from, consumers are not limited by the availability of specific
               products in  their  local  town,  city  or  country. Items  can  be  sourced  and  shipped
               globally. Interestingly,  one  recent  study  found  that  consumers  are  actually  starting  to
               become frustrated by e-commerce sites that offer too much choice. Whichever way you
               look at it though, more choice has likely been a good thing over the long term.







                                                            - 63 -]]></page><page Index="152"><![CDATA[Naturally e-commerce has significant benefits for the consumer, but it has also been
               useful for businesses too. Next, we look at some of the reasons why businesses have
               been quick to race into the space.



               Why Do Businesses Sell ‘Online’?


            1.  Higher  Margins: Setup  costs  and ongoing  operational  costs  such  as  rent,  heating,
               electricity, warehousing (if operating a drop-ship model) and inventory management are
               often significantly reduced or otherwise eliminated. Further, customer service and other
               administrative  tasks  can  be  automated  or  outsourced  at  a  relatively  low-cost.  As
               such, higher margins can usually be achieved when selling via an online store compared
               to operating an offline business.


            2.  Scalability: With a brick and mortar business, the owner is often limited by the amount
               of people who can physically be in the store at any one time. There is no limit when trading
               online. Running  an  e-commerce  business  means tapping  into  a  truly  global
               market. Furthermore, online platforms enable rapid scaling. With the emergence of social
               media and content marketing as well as the option of generating traffic and conversions
               through pay-per-click (PPC), expanding into new regions or markets can happen quickly.
               A great example of this in practice is Choxi, a business that experienced 1,023% growth
               in revenue in just one year.


            3.  Consumer  Insight  /  Technology: E-commerce  businesses  typically  collate  a
               tremendous amount of customer data. With every element of consumer behavior being
               tracked, e-commerce business owners are able to understand, tweak and improve the
               customer shopping  experience for customers  –  making data-led decisions  to  increase
               conversion rates and sales. With technology rapidly evolving, it is important that online
               retailers  use  tools  such  as  Google  Analytics  correctly to  understand  their  customers’
               buying habits, unlocking insight from this data presents a unique advantage, not available
               to offline stores. Those who leverage the right systems and technology can see their
               businesses grow extremely quickly.


               Having  understood  the  benefits  of  running  an  e-commerce  business,  it’s  time  to  turn
               attention towards the different types of e-commerce businesses available.

               Overview of E-Commerce Fulfilment Models
               There are three main fulfillment models associated with e-commerce that dictate the role
               of the retailer as well as the way in which a product is stored and distributed to the end-
               user. These models have a significant impact on the operational characteristics of the
               business and its day-to-day running as well as the overall operating margin. The three
               main models are:

               In a dropshipping model, the e-commerce business takes no physical possession of the
               items on sale. The store owner does not keep products in stock and there is no inventory
               held. Instead, orders are sent directly to the manufacturer, who is responsible for storing
               the items and shipping them to the customer. In this sense, the merchant never sees or
               touches the  products,  which  has  some  unique  advantages  over  adopting  a  more
               traditional order fulfilment model.


            2.  Traditional Order Fulfilment Model

               Buying wholesale is arguably closest to the traditional offline retail model. In effect, the
               business owner (retailer) acquires stock directly from a wholesaler at a discounted rate,
               applies a margin onto each product and decides to deliver to consumers directly.


               Benefits of Dropshipping vs. Traditional Order Fulfilment:


            •  Eliminates Inventory Risk: One of the biggest drawbacks of running an offline retail
               business  or  a  non-dropship  e-commerce  business  is  the  fact  that  generally  speaking
               inventory has to be acquired upfront. Naturally, buying stock costs money and with no
               100% guarantee of being able to sell it, there is an inherent risk to the business owner.
               Drop-shipping however, does not generally require any upfront investment in inventory.

            •  Less Time / Lower Ongoing Costs: Shipping products requires a certain amount of
               owner and staff time. Time will be required to not only order stock but manage it, ensuring
               optimal stock control at all times to avoid turning away orders, all of which can be avoided
               with a drop-shipping model. Instead, the owner can be free to use this time to manage
               the overall strategy of the business and to ensure sales objectives are being met.


            •  Product Flexibility: If dropshipping, as a retailer, you have the flexibility to try out new
               product lines in your online store and sales channels which enables business owners to
               ‘go to market’ more quickly – an attractive proposition if looking to secure market share
               for a unique e-commerce value proposition.

               Whilst there are numerous advantages to the drop-shipping model, there are also some
               drawbacks that require careful consideration:


               Benefits of Traditional Order Fulfilment vs. Dropshipping Model:


            •  Lower Cost of Goods Sold (COGS): It is well-documented that a stocking retailer pays
               less  than  a  drop-shipping  retailer for the  same  stock-keeping unit  (SKU).  As  such, e-
               commerce business owners should look to weigh up the potential for fixed cost savings
               against the impact of a reduced margin on each SKU sold. Further, when scaling a drop-
               ship e-commerce business, the business tends not to benefit from economies of scale, in


                                                            - 65 -]]></page><page Index="154"><![CDATA[the same way that a non-drop ship business would. The marginal costs of employing a
               drop-ship model are the same whether 100 products or 10,000 products are sold.

            •  Inventory Management: Naturally, being in control of stock control allows you to know
               when you are running out and need to reorder in order to fulfil customer demand at that
               particular  point  in  time.  Running  a  drop-shipping  business  means high  reliance  on
               suppliers, who have to be relied upon to uphold inventory best practice and communicate
               their inventory levels in a timely manner.


            •  Brand Control: Whilst drop-shipping may seem like the easier option when considering
               e-commerce  fulfilment,  it  is  not  without  its  drawbacks. Missing  items,  low  quality  or
               damaged products are likely to occur and this is your responsibility, as the merchant to
               adequately  resolve.  Further,  the  choice  of  suppliers  who  drop-ship  can  be  limited,
               reducing the scope to potentially diversify your product offering (from the outset and in
               the future). If adopting a traditional model, you can set delivery standards and design all
               elements of customer service.

            3.  Outsourced Fulfilment Model


               The  retailer  may  wish  to  market  products  from  a  supplier  that  does  not  provide  a
               dropshipping service. If the retailer wants to avoid end-to-end fulfilment (like the traditional
               model), then a hybrid approach can be adopted – using a ‘fulfilment house’. In this model,
               companies  such  as Shipwire are  commissioned  to  handle  the  product  side  of  the
               business, on behalf of the retailer. Generally, speaking, they are responsible for collecting
               products from the supplier, holding the product at their distribution centers, all packaging
               as  well  as  onward  order  fulfilment (to  the  customer).  This  service  comes  at  a  cost  –
               minimum fees, return fees and setup fees are commonplace and should be fully weighed
               up beforehand.


               Dropshipping vs. Traditional Order Fulfilment Summary
               Dropshipping is a great option to have, particularly when starting out with an e-commerce
               business.  Cash  flow  management  is  easier  and  there  is  a reduced  burden  on  the
               workforce associated with fulfilment. That said, wholesale offers the longer-term benefits
               of higher margins and allows greater scope for building a truly differentiated brand. If a
               product  is high-margin,  an outsourced fulfilment  route  is possible,  but  should  be fully
               evaluated.

               Having  understood  the  main  e-commerce models,  it  is important  to spend  some time
               considering  the  technology  platform on  which  it  operates.  When  analysing  online
               businesses,  the  choice  of  platform  is  important; it  will  determine  the  basic  customer
               experience, checkout process and the day-to-day management of orders etc.


               To begin with, a decision needs to be made between a hosted or custom installation.
               Going  down  a  ‘hosted’  route  means  that  the hosting  provider  is  responsible  for
               maintenance of the hardware in their own data center. A custom installation will mean
               acquiring your own hardware. Both have practical implications for the owner, we have
               detailed some considerations below.


               A Comparison: Hosted vs. Custom Installation

            •  Technical Support: Hosted carts do not require technical knowledge, you do not have
               to  be  a  technical  expert. As  part  of  the  monthly  subscription,  hosted  companies  will
               provide 24-hour  technical  support (if  anything  goes  wrong).  A  custom  installation  will
               require either yourself or a technical developer to be at hand to resolve any issues that
               may arise, as the site is self-hosted. This can be costly in terms of fees (if you are not
               technical) particularly if there is any site downtime that leads to a loss in e-commerce
               sales. As a site owner, if you are able to do the maintenance and back-end development
               yourself, a custom installation should be fine.


            •  Customization and Features: Hosted carts are generally very feature-rich and will have
               a large roadmap of features and upgrades to improve user experience on-site, analytics
               etc. over time. This is all included in the monthly subscription. That said, hosted platforms
               do cater  for  a  huge  number  of  customers and  only  popular  features  are  likely  to  be
               released. If you need a lot of customization or a specific feature set, it may be worth going
               down a custom route. A custom site has many advantages, including complete control
               and personalization of the buying experience. A hosted template on the other hand, may

               standard check out process is required, a hosted solution should be fine.


































            •  Mobile-friendly: By  2022,  global mobile  data  traffic  will  reach  an annual  rate  of  77.6
               exabytes  per  month (up  from  19.01  in  2018).  In  most  countries  (including  the
               US), smartphones represent more mobile transactions than tablets. For e-commerce, this
               is a big shift and it is important to be mobile-optimized and mobile-friendly to ensure the
               best possible user experience. Hosted solutions such as Shopify come with ‘responsive’
               themes enabling a great look on mobile and tablet devices. If self-hosting for the benefit
               of  customization  and  extension,  ensure  that  you  speak  to  your  developer  about  the
               implications from a mobile-readiness standpoint.

            •  Cost: Hosted  solutions  provide  extremely high  performance  for  a  relatively  low-cost
               monthly cost. If looking to self-host, a custom installation will require a one-time fee for
               installation  and  you  will  need  to  source  and  manage  the  hardware  and  infrastructure
               which  could  be  very  expensive.  Over  time  however,  the  total  monthly  fee  for  some
               platforms can equal the cost of paying for a self-hosted platform. As such, it is worth
               weighing up the other trade-offs rather than basing the decision purely on cost.

               It is important to remember that if a self-hosted solution is preferable, shopping carts can
               be switched. Businesses sitting on out-dated self-hosted installations can be moved over
               to  hosted  carts  at  a  relatively  low-cost  (depending  on  level  of  complexity,  number  of
               integrations). Further, it is important to plan ahead and research when deciding on which
               route to take – hosted may make sense now, but as the business grows self-hosted could
               make more sense.

               Having decided on the relative merits of growing the business via a hosted vs. self-hosted
               route,  there  are  plenty  of  options  available  in  terms  of  solution  providers.  We
               recently assessed  a  number  of  different  e-commerce  platforms and  looked  into which
               platforms were most popular, below serves as a good starting point:

               Having  a broad  idea  of  your  requirements for  each  of  the  items  listed  above  is  an
               important aspect of deciding whether to re-platform. Platform choice will depend on the
               business in question and specific goals. It is worth spending some time detailing specific
               requirements out, in order to speed up the process.


               E-commerce has grown rapidly and changed significantly over the years, as such there

               A website following the B2B business model sells its products to an intermediate buyer

               an order from a company's website and after receiving the consignment, it sells the

                Following are the key technologies used in B2B e-commerce −
                   •  Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) − EDI is an inter-organizational exchange of
                       business documents in a structured and machine processable format.

                   •  Internet − Internet represents the World Wide Web or the network of networks
                       connecting computers across the world.

                   •  Intranet − Intranet represents a dedicated network of computers within a single
                       organization.
                   •  Extranet − Extranet represents a network where the outside business partners,
                       suppliers,  or  customers  can  have  a  limited  access  to  a  portion  of  enterprise
                       intranet/network.
                   •  Back-End Information System Integration − Back-end information systems are
                       database management systems used to manage the business data.

               Architectural Models
                Following are the architectural models in B2B e-commerce −

                   •  Supplier Oriented marketplace − In this type of model, a common marketplace
                       provided by supplier is used by both individual customers as well as business
                       users. A supplier offers an e-stores for sales promotion.
                   •  Buyer  Oriented  marketplace −  In  this  type  of  model,  buyer  has  his/her  own
                       market place or e-market. He invites suppliers to bid on product's catalog. A Buyer
                       company opens a bidding site.
                   •  Intermediary  Oriented  marketplace −  In  this  type  of  model,  an  intermediary
                       company runs a market place where business buyers and sellers can transact
                       with each other.
                E-commerce  business  models  can  generally  be  categorized  into  the  following
                categories.


                   •  Business - to - Business (B2B)
                   •  Business - to - Consumer (B2C)
                   •  Consumer - to - Consumer (C2C)
                   •  Consumer - to - Business (C2B)
                   •  Business - to - Government (B2G)
                   •  Government - to - Business (G2B)

                   •  Government - to - Citizen (G2C)
               Business - to - Consumer

                A website following the B2C business model sells its products directly to a customer. A
                customer can view the products shown on the website. The customer can choose a

                organization  via  email  and  the  organization  will  dispatch  the  product/goods  to  the
                customer.



























               Consumer - to - Consumer

                A website following the C2C business model helps consumers to sell their assets like
                residential property, cars, motorcycles, etc., or rent a room by publishing their information
                on the website. Website may or may not charge the consumer for its services. Another
                consumer  may  opt  to  buy  the  product  of  the  first  customer  by  viewing  the
                post/advertisement on the website.


































                                                            - 72 -]]></page><page Index="161"><![CDATA[Consumer - to - Business

                In  this  model,  a  consumer  approaches  a  website  showing  multiple  business
                organizations  for  a  particular  service.  The  consumer  places  an  estimate  of  amount
                he/she wants to spend for a particular service. For example, the comparison of interest
                rates  of  personal  loan/car  loan  provided  by  various  banks  via  websites.  A  business
                organization  who  fulfills  the  consumer's  requirement  within  the  specified  budget,
                approaches the customer and provides its services.



























               Business - to - Government

                B2G model is a variant of B2B model. Such websites are used by governments to trade
                and  exchange  information  with  various  business  organizations.  Such  websites  are
                accredited by the government and provide a medium to businesses to submit application
                forms to the government.







                                                                                             Government
               - to - Citizen


                Governments use G2C model websites to approach citizen in general. Such websites
                support  auctions  of  vehicles,  machinery,  or  any  other  material.  Such  website  also
                provides  services  like  registration  for  birth,  marriage  or  death  certificates.  The  main
                objective of G2C websites is to reduce the average time for fulfilling citizen’s requests
                for various government services.









                                                            - 73 -]]></page><page Index="162"><![CDATA[E-Commerce - Payment Systems


                E-commerce sites use electronic payment, where electronic payment refers to paperless
                monetary transactions. Electronic payment has revolutionized the business processing
                by reducing the paperwork, transaction costs, and labor cost. Being user friendly and
                less time-consuming than manual processing, it helps business organization to expand
                its market reach/expansion. Listed below are some of the modes of electronic payments
                −

                   •  Credit Card

                   •  Debit Card
                   •  Smart Card
                   •  E-Money
                   •  Electronic Fund Transfer (EFT)

               Credit Card
                Payment using credit card is one of most common mode of electronic payment. Credit
                card is small plastic card with a unique number attached with an account. It has also a
                magnetic strip embedded in it which is used to read credit card via card readers. When
                a customer purchases a product via credit card, credit card issuer bank pays on behalf
                of the customer and customer has a certain time period after which he/she can pay the
                credit card bill. It is usually credit card monthly payment cycle. Following are the actors
                in the credit card system.

                   •  The card holder − Customer
                   •  The merchant − seller of product who can accept credit card payments.
                   •  The card issuer bank − card holder's bank

                   •  The acquirer bank − the merchant's bank
                   •  The card brand − for example , visa or Mastercard.









                                                            - 74 -]]></page><page Index="163"><![CDATA[Credit Card Payment Proces


                     Step                                          Description



                 Step 1           Bank issues and activates a credit card to the customer on his/her request.




                 Step 2           The customer presents the credit card information to the merchant site or
                                  to the merchant from whom he/she wants to purchase a product/service.




                 Step 3           Merchant validates the customer's identity by asking for approval from the
                                  card brand company.



                 Step 4           Card brand company authenticates the credit card and pays the
                                  transaction by credit. Merchant keeps the sales slip.



                 Step 5           Merchant submits the sales slip to acquirer banks and gets the service
                                  charges paid to him/her.



                 Step 6           Acquirer bank requests the card brand company to clear the credit amount
                                  and gets the payment.



                 Step 7           Now the card brand company asks to clear the amount from the issuer
                                  bank and the amount gets transferred to the card brand company.



               Debit Card
                Debit card, like credit card, is a small plastic card with a unique number mapped with the
                bank account number. It is required to have a bank account before getting a debit card
                from the bank. The major difference between a debit card and a credit card is that in
                case of payment through debit card, the amount gets deducted from the card's bank
                account immediately and there should be sufficient balance in the bank account for the
                transaction to get completed; whereas in case of a credit card transaction, there is no
                such compulsion.
                Debit cards free the customer to carry cash and cheques. Even merchants accept a debit
                card readily. Having a restriction on the amount that can be withdrawn in a day using a
                debit card helps the customer to keep a check on his/her spending.




                                                            - 75 -]]></page><page Index="164"><![CDATA[Smart Card

                Smart card is again similar to a credit card or a debit card in appearance, but it has a
                small microprocessor chip embedded in it. It has the capacity to store a customer’s work-
                related and/or personal information. Smart cards are also used to store money and the
                amount gets deducted after every transaction.
                Smart cards can only be accessed using a PIN that every customer is assigned with.
                Smart  cards  are  secure,  as  they  store  information  in  encrypted  format  and  are  less
                expensive/provides faster processing. Mondex and Visa Cash cards are examples of
                smart cards.

               E-Money

                E-Money transactions refer to situation where payment is done over the network and the
                amount gets transferred from one financial body to another financial body without any
                involvement of a middleman. E-money transactions are faster, convenient, and saves a
                lot of time.

                Online payments done via credit cards, debit cards, or smart cards are examples of e-
                money  transactions.  Another  popular  example  is  e-cash.  In  case  of  e-cash,  both
                customer and merchant have to sign up with the bank or company issuing e-cash.

               Electronic Fund Transfer

                It is a very popular electronic payment method to transfer money from one bank account
                to another bank account. Accounts can be in the same bank or different banks. Fund
                transfer can be done using ATM (Automated Teller Machine) or using a computer.

                Nowadays,  internet-based EFT  is  getting  popular. In  this  case, a customer uses  the
                website provided by the bank, logs in to the bank's website and registers another bank
                account.  He/she  then  places  a  request  to  transfer  certain  amount  to  that  account.
                Customer's  bank  transfers  the  amount  to  other  account  if  it  is  in  the  same  bank,
                otherwise the transfer request is forwarded to an ACH (Automated Clearing House) to
                transfer the amount to other account and the amount is deducted from the customer's
                account. Once the amount is transferred to other account, the customer is notified of the
                fund transfer by the bank.



                 5 Key Technologies for B2B Marketers


               The five – the Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence, Advanced Robotics, Wearables
               and 3D Printing – provide a plethora of sales messaging opportunities for B2B
               marketers.
               B2B marketers should develop strategic messaging of how their organization’s
               technology will help CEO’s and COO’s transform their business and set their companies
               up for success.

                                                            - 76 -]]></page><page Index="165"><![CDATA[The five technologies reside in different stages of adoption. In addition, the technologies
               have varied levels of uncertainty about their future direction and which vendors will
               prevail as the undisputed market leader. Disruptive technologies (robotics, 3D printing
               and augmented reality) are quite popular and their are use cases that are intoxicating,
               however, the develop is in the details (implementation and user experience).

               Here are the 5 key technologies for B2B marketers to message around for the
               foreseeable future:



               The Internet of Things (IoT)

               IoT refers to the ever-growing network of physical objects that feature an IP address
               and that allows for internet connectivity. Communication then can occur between these
               objects and other Internet-enabled devices and systems.

               IoT is basically the evolution of technologies that have been developed over the last
               decade or two. Today, operations and automation technologies are now converging.
               The number of sensors with cloud and connectivity are estimated to grow to almost
               $80B by 2025- more than a 4X increase from today.

               Smart enterprise control, asset performance management in real-time and smart and
               connected products and services are the areas predicted to gain market traction most
               quickly. Cybersecurity and interoperability challenges will challenge vendors and service
               providers from embracing IoT on factory floors and throughout their supply chain as
               85% of assets are “disconnected”.



               Artificial Intelligence (AI)

               AI makes it possible for machines to learn from experience and to adjust to new inputs
               and perform human-like tasks. Most AI use cases rely heavily on machine learning,
               deep learning and natural language processing to process large amounts of data and
               recognize patterns in the data.
               Today, approximately 70% of captured production data (structure and unstructured)
               goes unused. Combining AI with IoT allows organizations to orchestrate and streamline
               business processes and any data source from any device. Early adoption for AI in
               production environments is expected to be in quality management, predictive
               maintenance and supply chain optimization.



               Advanced Robotics

               Advanced robotics earned its start in the 1980s. Back then, advanced robotics was
               used to define any sensor-based robots that attempted to mimic human intelligence.
               Advanced Robotics have been used in a variety of fields ranging from manufacturing,
               nuclear, construction, space and underwater exploration, and healthcare.



                                                            - 77 -]]></page><page Index="166"><![CDATA[In short, advanced robotics deals with devices that act largely, or partly, autonomously.
               These devices interact physically with people or their environments and are capable of
               modifying their behavior based upon sensor data.

               Advanced robotics are typically focused on the dull, dirty, repetitious and dangerous
               jobs. It’s estimated that advance robotics automate about 10% of production tasks.
               Recently, robotics have been included on production floors (sometimes alongside
               humans).



               Enterprise Wearables

               Wearable technology generally refers to electronics that can be worn as an accessory
               or as part of material used in clothing. The most popular wearable technology devices
               are activity trackers and smartwatches. The key for wearable technology is its ability to
               connect to the internet, allowing data to be exchanged between the device and the
               network (and with any system, process or application that resides in the cloud.) Since
               wearable technology can push and pull data, it is a natural driver for IoT.

               Enterprise wearables (including augmented and virtual reality) comprise one of the
               fastest growing markets. Market size today is estimated at $700M but exponential
               growth is forecast to propel this market to $5B by 2020.

               The comfort, functionality and safety of wearables will continue to improve which will
               fuel adoption. Some use cases have shown returns of up to 25% improvement in
               operator productivity as well as significant decreases in the time required for training
               and upskilling. Not to mention health and safety improvements.







               3D Printing

               3D printing refers to the manufacturing of a three-dimensional product from a computer-
               driven digital model. The 3D printing process is additive as multiple layers from CAD
               (computer-aided design) drawings are laid down one after another to create different
               shapes. The most popular use cases for 3D printing include aerospace, engineering,
               architecture, healthcare, medical, industrial design and construction.

               3D printing has the potential to revolutionize some traditional production processes. A
               recent surge in metal 3D printing capabilities has propelled growth. In addition, 3D
               printing applied to use cases that require customization and time-to-market are key
               value drivers – typically low-volume, high-value parts. Even though 3D has proven
               valuable, 3D printing is not expected to replace conventional manufacturing (long
               production runs) or mass localization of production footprints residing closer to
               consumers anytime soon.

               B2B marketers and sales professionals need to sit down and document their
               organizations value proposition at a strategic level. Then, that value needs to be woven
               into one of the big technology trends: Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence, Advanced
               Robotics or Wearables and 3D Printing. The key is to connect and organization’s value,
               a key technology trend and a desired business outcome (increased revenue,
               profitability, productivity, customer satisfaction, brand equity or deceased expenses).
               Develop your sale sand marketing messaging so that demand generation, account-
               based marketers, field sales, inside sales and sales development reps are saying the
               same thing – along with your website.

                Lesson Proper: Agricultural Profile

               THE PHILIPPINES, ONE OF THE LARGEST island-groups in the world with 7,100
               islands and islets, is strategically located within the area of nations that sweeps
               southeast from Mainland Asia across the equator to Australia.
               Its boundaries are formed by three large bodies of water: on the west and north by the
               South China Sea; on the east by the Pacific Ocean; and on the south by the Celebes
               Sea and coastal waters of Borneo. The total land area of the Philippines is 300
               thousand square kilometers or 30 million hectares. It constitutes two percent of the total
               land area of the world and ranks 57th among the 146 countries of the world in terms of
               physical size.
               The Philippines advocates the archipelago doctrine, as such it gains exclusive to all
               resources living or non-living in and at the bottom of an area of about 276,000 square
               nautical miles.
               The Philippines is divided into three major island groups: Luzon, with an area of 141
               thousand square kilometers; Mindanao, with an area of 102 thousand square
               kilometers; and Visayas, with an area of 57 thousand square kilometers.

               Climate Map of the Philippines
               Based on the seasonal rainfall distribution, the climate of the Philippines is classified as
               follows:
                       Type I: Two pronounced seasons with maximum rain period from June to
                       September and a dry season which lasts from three to six or seven months?
                       Type II: No dry season with a very pronounced maximum rain period from
                       December to February.
                       Type III: No pronounced maximum rain period with a short dry season lasting
                       only from      to three months.

               The tropical cyclone season in the country is from June to December, with the months
               from July to September having the most frequent occurrence of more than 3 cyclones
               each month. Annual relative humidity ranges from 75 to 86 percent and annual mean
               temperature is between 19.20 and 28.20 °C while annual rainfall ranges from 914 to
               4,358 millimeters.
                Land Area
               The Philippines is an agricultural country with a land area of 30 million hectares, 47% of
               which is agricultural land. In the Philippines, prime agricultural lands are located around
               the main urban and high population density areas.
               Land resources in the country are generally classified into forest lands and alienable
               and disposable lands. A total of 15.8 million hectares were classified into forest lands,
               and 14.2 million hectares are alienable and disposable lands. Out of the 14.2 million
               hectares alienable and disposable lands, 93% or 13 million hectares are classified as
               agricultural lands.

               Land Distribution
               The total area devoted to agricultural crops is 13 million hectares. This is distributed
               among food grains, food crops and non-food crops. Food grains occupied 31% (4.01
               million hectares), food crops utilized 52% (8.33 million hectares) while 17% (2.2 million
               hectares) were used for non-food crops.
               For food grains, the average area utilized by corn was 3.34 million while rice occupied
               3.31 million hectares. Of the total area under food crops, coconut accounted for the
               biggest average harvest area of 4.25 million hectares. Sugarcane with 673 thousand
               hectares; Industrial crops with 591 thousand hectares; 148 thousand hectares for fruits;
               270 thousand hectares for vegetables and rootcrops; 404 thousand hectares for pasture
               and 133 hectares for cutflower.
               According to land capability, 78.31% of the alienable and disposable land are prime
               agricultural areas, 6.1 million hectares are highly suitable for cultivation.

               Farm System/Structure
               Philippine agriculture is characterized by a mixture of small, medium and large farms.
               Majority of the farms in the country are all small farms averaging about 2 hectares.
               These are simple farms which are owned and managed by single families ranging from
               subsistence to commercial production.
               Farming is generally undertaken on small farms. Two-thirds of all farms in 1988 were no
               larger than three hectares. Eighty-five percent of all farms were no more than five
               hectares. Over a period of ten years ending in 1996, the proportion of small farms had
               been expanding. The Philippine Agrarian Reform Council Secretariat reported that the
               government had acquired and distributed about 4.1 million hectares of agricultural lands


                                                            - 82 -]]></page><page Index="171"><![CDATA[to agrarian reform beneficiaries. Under this Program implementing the comprehensive
               agrarian reform law, a farm household cannot own a farm larger than five hectares. A
               typical farming system consists of a major crops, with rice, corn and coconut as
               common base crops, and a few heads of livestock and poultry.
               Rice, corn, coconut and many crops are principally produced by small farms. Prior to
               CARP, there were large plantations in rubber, coffee, oil palm, cacao, banana,
               pineapple, etc. Contract growing schemes operate in corn seeds, banana, tomato,
               cucumber, oil palm, asparagus and broiler chicken.

               General Performance of Agriculture
               Over the past six decades, the agricultural sector was confronted by both internal and
               external bottlenecks that constrained its performance and growth. Despite the sector’s
               desire to implement reforms to increase productivity, efficiency, competitiveness, market
               adaptability, and sustainability of agri-based industries, these reforms were hampered
               by inadequate resources, limited implementing capabilities of national and local
               government units ( LGUs), and weak coordination among implementing agencies. In
               addition, the occasional occurrences of natural disasters (e.g., El Niño phenomenon
               and La Niña phenomena) and international market crisis (e.g., 1997 financial crisis)
               exacerbated the real growth of the sector, resulting to contraction in output as observed
               in 1998.
               From 1993 to 2004, agriculture, fisheries, and forestry hardly grew on the average by
               2.6% ( Fig. 1). Real growth in agriculture of 1% in the Philippines from 1980 to 1990
               lagged behind the world average and middle-income country average of 2.8% and
               3.5%, respectively. Neighboring Asian countries such as China, Vietnam, and Thailand
               posted very high growth rates during the period. From 1990 to1997, the Philippines
               improved its real agricultural growth rate to 1.9%, but this is still considerably lower than
               middle-income countries in Asia. However, during the 1998-2003 period, Philippine
               agricultural growth was comparable to Thailand and Vietnam.

                Commitment


               MISSION / VISION
               As stipulated in the Philippine Development Plan (PDP) 2011-2016, Chapter 4,
               Competitive and Sustainable Agriculture and Fisheries Sector, the agriculture and
               fisheries sector provide food and vital raw materials for the rest of the economy. As the
               sector grows and modernizes, it releases surplus labor to the industry and services
               sectors. Rising productivity and efficiency in the sector are critical in maintaining the
               affordability of food and purchasing power, especially among the poor. The sector's
               development is therefore vital in achieving inclusive growth and poverty reduction as
               well as attaining the targets under the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).

               in its many dimensions-income poverty, hunger, disease, lack of adequate shelter, and
               exclusion-while promoting gender equality, education, and environmental sustainability.

               Mandate
               The Department of Agriculture is the principal agency of the Philippine government
               responsible for the promotion of agricultural and fisheries development and growth. In
               pursuit of this, it provides a policy framework that directs public investments and, in
               partnership with the local government units (LGUs), provides the support services
               necessary to make agriculture and fisheries, and agri-based enterprises profitable and
               to help spread the benefits of development to the poor, particularly those in the rural
               areas.


               Vision
               A modernized smallholder agriculture and fisheries; a diversified rural economy that is
               dynamic, technologically advanced and internationally competitive. Its transformation is
               guided by the sound practices of resource sustainability, the principles of social justice,
               and a strong private sector participation.


               Mission
               To help and empower the farming and fishing communities and the private sector to
               produce enough, accessible and affordable food for every Filipino and a decent income
               for all.

                Lesson Proper: Economic Integration

               Introduction
               ASEAN, a regional organization promoting governmental and economic cooperation
               and regional stability, has ten members - Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia,
               Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam. Since its formation in 1967, the
               organization has helped an underdeveloped region grow into one of the main drivers of
               the global economy, with a combined GDP of USD2.55 trillion in 2016. With a large,
               young workforce, predicted GDP growth of 4.8% in 2017, and a newly-implemented
               single market - the AEC - the region provides an attractive destination for investors.

               Economic integration
               The establishment of the AEC provides a single market across the region. The simpler
               cross-border processes and harmonized regulation in areas such as intellectual
               property paves the way for a company based in one ASEAN country to do business in
               all others.
               Established in 2015, the AEC has:
               – Virtually eliminated tariffs between members, with formal restrictions in the service
               sector being gradually removed
               – Simplified and harmonized customs and technical regulations
               – Enhanced mobility of skilled professionals between member countries
               The ASEAN member states have adopted a blueprint of their goals for 2025. Key
               characteristics are:

               A GROWTH STORY
               The Philippine economy, as measured by its GDP, has performed remarkably well on a
               number of fronts. Despite external headwinds, bouts of fiscal underspending and natural
               calamities, the country has consistently Domestic liquidity growth was driven largely by
               the Overseas Filipino Workers (OFW) phenomenon. Remittance inflows from OFW
               helped relieve unemployment, boost household incomes and spending, and stabilized
               the country’s external finances
               On the demand side, remittances have long been a driver of consumption and the
               economy’s growth. On the supply side, the services sector is supported by the
               information technology-business process outsourcing, finance, real estate and tourism
               industries. These, and the advantages brought by trends in demographics and
               urbanization, provide new stabilizers for the country’s economy amid possible external
               shocks and global economic uncertainty. In 2015, increased investments in public
               construction and durable equipment led to a 14-percent expansion of fixed capital
               formation. The new administration, through the Department of Budget and Management

                Lesson Proper: Agri-Business Opportunities

                       Agribusiness refers to agriculture-related activities that put farmers, processors,
               distributors, and consumers within a system that produces, processes, transports,
               markets, and distributes agricultural products.
               The transformation of agricultural farming into a thriving agribusiness-driven sector
               entails acquiring farming technologies, training in more sophisticated farming
               techniques, creating stable supply chains, establishing transport and agricultural
               infrastructure, investing and research and development, and securing a reliable property
               rights regime.
               These activities can contribute not only in diversifying and increasing the value of
               agribusiness outputs, but also contribute to the inclusive growth and rural development
               agenda of the Philippine government. Because of this, the agribusiness sector is
               positioned to largely contribute to the industrial development of the Philippine economy.

               What Is a Business Plan?
               A business plan is a roadmap for your small farm. It is both process and product. During
               the writing of a farm business plan, you'll develop an overall vision and mission for your
               business. You will think about your short- and long-term goals. You'll define the steps
               needed to achieve those goals. You'll set the direction for your business to develop over
               the next five years.
               If you're already an established business, your new business plan will show where
               you're going next.
               A good business plan should be:
                       Realistic
                       Simple
                       Specific
                       Complete
               Mission Statement
               Your farm’s mission statement is your overarching purpose for your business:
               Why does your farm exist?
               What purpose does your farm serve?
               Where is your farm headed?

               core identity as a small farm.
               Goals
               The goals in your business plan are the specific, measurable “things” you will achieve
               with your small farm. Short-term goals are defined as those that you will complete within
               one year. Long-term goals are those that take longer than one year to complete.
               SMART Goals are:
                       Specific
                       Measurable
                       Attainable
                       Rewarding, and have a
                       Timeline
               Background Information
               In this section of your business plan, take inventory of what you have right now:
               Where are you located?
               How many acres of land are you farming?
               When did you begin farming?
               How are you currently operating?
               What general practices do you use for such things as conservation, tillage,
               environmental impact, and marketing?
               Farm Strategy
               This is where your business plan gets to looking forward. You are going to formulate
               your farm strategy from now into the next five years or so.
                       1. Gather information and research markets. Make sure that your farm plan fits
               into the general market in terms of supply and demand. Investigate and analyze
               industry trends, identify competitors, and define buyers.
                       2. SWOT Analysis. This is an analytical tool that can be used in making
               decisions. SWOT stands for: strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats.
               As a business, analyze your internal strengths and weaknesses. Then look externally at
               what opportunities and threats exist - competitors, new markets, government
               regulations, economic conditions, and so forth.
                       3. Create alternative strategies. Looking at the information you've gleaned and
               the analysis you just did, think through options for your farm strategy. Don't rely on price
               alone; economies of scale are challenging on the small farm level.
                       4. Don't jump to one conclusion immediately. Really spend some time fleshing
               out the specifics of some of the strategies and looking at their advantages and
               disadvantages. Try to find options that combine your internal strengths with
               opportunities in the external environment.
                       5. Look at all your strategies, then reread your mission statement. The ideal farm
               plan will fit your mission best.

               your current finances in detail, including all income and operating expenses. Referring
               to your new strategy, you will forecast what is needed for future growth and to meet the
               goals you have outlined in terms of capital. Include what your future operating expenses

                Lesson Proper: Challenges of sustained agricultural growth

                       The Philippines being an agricultural country need to invest in promoting
               inclusive growth, and build more sustainable agriculture and food systems, that are
               resilient to calamities and respond effectively to climate change impact. The main goal
               is to develop the agriculture sector to be able to attain food self-sufficiency, uplift the
               rural community and increase the income of the farmers. Agriculture's contribution to the
               economy is estimated to be about 40 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) and
               two-thirds of jobs arise from agriculture. However, agricultural sector has been beset
               with persistent challenges resulting in low farm incomes, low rural employment, lack of
               food security, and meager agricultural competitiveness.
               Among the 17 targeted areas of the Global Sustainable Development Goals, the
               Philippines should specifically pursue the goals to end/minimize hunger, achieve food
               security, improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture. The status of
               Philippine agriculture as well as the challenges and strategies for sustainable
               development were discussed. Challenges identified were lack of important provisions
               that will guarantee food security and reduce poverty in the countryside, lack of programs
               that will link agriculture with the industry, and insufficient activities aimed to vigorously
               transfer advanced production, post-harvest, and processing technologies to the
               stakeholders, among others.
                       1. Sustainably improving agricultural productivity to meet increasing demand
                       2. Ensuring a sustainable natural resource base
                       3. Addressing climate change and intensification of natural hazards
                       4. Eradicating extreme poverty and reducing inequality
                       5. Ending hunger and all forms of malnutrition

                       10. Addressing the need for coherent and effective national and international
                       governance

                       Farming and fishing are major sources of livelihood in rural households in the
               Philippines. Farming systems in the country are complex, multi-faceted, and geared to
               promote efficient production and a steady source of income. However, these have also
               wrought unwanted consequences on the environment, notably soil erosion, water
               pollution, groundwater depletion, loss of natural habitats, and loss of biological diversity.
               Farming systems are affected by exogenous environmental factors; in turn, the farming
               systems also affect agricultural production resource bases. Initiatives from various
               sectors to mitigate the adverse environmental impacts of farming systems and to protect
               the agricultural production bases are in place in terms of policies, programs, and action
               projects.

                       The characteristics of an agricultural marketing system and how it operates
               greatly depend on overall development stage of a country. Following three stages of
               development are useful in understanding the degree of sophistication of an agricultural
               marketing system.

               TRADITIONAL SUBSISTENCE ECONOMIES
                       In traditional subsistence economies, majority of the people earn their livelihood
               from farming. Generally, agricultural production and income of farmers are low. They
               eat what they produce and little is left as marketable surplus. Agricultural production
               tends to be distinctively divided between commercial export crops and subsistence food
               crops. The traditional subsistence economy produces a limited variety of agricultural
               crops. A few basic grains, root crops or pulses make up the diet of majority of the
               people. Consequently, a limited variety of commodities are brought to the market for
               trading. Marketing transactions are often made directly by the farmer or his wife sitting
               in the market place. The product can be seen, smelled, weighed and tasted and
               differences over price and product quality are discussed by both parties in a transaction.
               Thus, chances of error, misunderstanding or other problems are minimized. Often, there
               is an absence of governmental support for new technology to develop agricultural
               production. Changes take place slowly in agricultural sector and most crops are sold at
               very short distance from where these are produced. Marketing systems and facilities
               expand more or less immediately/automatically to meet marketable surplus. Major
               urban centers within these countries at this stage of development may have elements of
               a more advanced marketing system.

               TRANSITIONAL AGRICULTURAL ECONOMIES
                       As countries develop, these become increasingly urbanized and more market
               oriented and often urban population is as large as rural population. The growth of
               agricultural production is a priority in development plans. Commercial agricultural
               increases and private and public capital starts pouring into farming and agribusiness.
               Temporary surpluses may appear for some crops that may lead to marketing and
               distribution constraints. With income advances and population shifts, more products
               move greater distances to market.
               As major proportion of the country’s food crop consumption starts going to urban
               markets and more production gets available for commercial markets, the need for
               general expansion of the marketing system is greatly felt. This requires additional

               reporting and market news.

               MARKET ORIENTED AGRICULTURE
                       In market-oriented economies, urban population is the dominant demographic
               characteristic. Commercial agriculture becomes a prominent producer of agricultural
               commodities and as result resource allocation problems emerge within agricultural
               sector. Problems of diversification in developing new markets are given high priority by
               the government. The problems of food supply begin to shift from issues of production to
               issues of distribution, and from commodities to nutrition. Improvements in income and
               technology continue to become more general throughout the economy. More food is
               processed and packaged. Consequently, a food industry focusing consumer
               preferences for new food products is developed and a national marketing system is
               emerged.

               STAKEHOLDERS IN AGRICULTURAL MARKETING SYSTEM
                       An agricultural marketing system generally comprises of five main stakeholders
               or market actors i.e. producers, traders, trade supporters, trade planners/decision
               makers and consumers. Each of these stakeholders has its own specific marketing
               goals as described below.

               PRODUCERS
                       The producers or farmers are main stakeholders in an agricultural marketing
               system. They produce wide variety of food items for self-consumption as well as for
               supply in the market. Agricultural producers are interested in maximization of their net
               farm income and aversion of risks involved in production and marketing of their
               produce. Moreover, they want developed and guaranteed markets, improved market
               position, increased and stabilized prices for outputs besides stable supply and prices of
               inputs.

               TRADERS
                       These are the people who mostly operate in the markets and relate producers
               with consumers. Commission men, brokers, wholesalers and retailers all belong to this
               group. Traders desire to have high volume and profit, time and cost-efficient purchasing,
               no trade restrictions and minimum market risk.

               TRADE SUPPORTERS
                       Trade supporters do not directly participate in trading activities of the market.
               They support and facilitate performance of trading activities and are interested in
               enhancing efficiency in exchange of goods. Smooth functioning of market systems and

               TRADE PLANNERS/DECISION MAKERS
                       This group of stakeholders is responsible for making decisions relating to
               agricultural marketing. Planners and decision makers have social and political goals
               generally related to securing ample food supplies and expanding domestic agriculture
               markets. Other major objectives of this group include price stabilization and promotion
               of export sector

               CONSUMERS
                       The last group in the marketing chain comprises of consumers but their influence
               is considered a derived function which is executed through traders and trade
               institutions. Major objectives of consumers include acquisitions of good quality products,
               low prices of products and better services.

                       Marketing system productivity is usually measured by the amount of usefulness
               often  referred  to  as  “utility”  that  the  system  adds  to  the  agricultural  products.  The
               marketing  process  add  utility  and  hence  value  and  desirability  to  a  product  for  the
               satisfaction of customer needs and wants. Following types of utilities are added by a
               marketing system:

               FORM UTILITY
                       Agricultural products cannot be consumed in raw form. Form utility is a conversion
               process  through  which  raw  products  are  transformed  into  form,  style,  appearance  or
               quality as desired by customers. It is added by processing or other methods and is fairly
               recognizable. Conversion of wheat into flour and bread, fruits into jams and juices, and
               slaughtering of animals and cutting into smaller pieces all add form utility.

               PLACE UTILITY
                       Agricultural commodities are produced at distant places mostly in the rural areas
               located at greater distances from the consumers in the urban areas. Place utility involves
               transporting the product to a location where it is desired by the consumer. Transportation
               serves this purpose and, hence, adds place utility.

               TIME UTILITY
                        In case of agriculture, production is not spread evenly throughout the year rather
               skewed in specific seasons and considerable time lag exists between production and
               consumption. Storage function creates time utility that makes products available to the
               consumer  at  desired  time. Wheat  is  generally  produced  only  once  in  a  year  but  it  is
               consumed all year long. Storage function provides time utility by making wheat available
               during the entire year.

               POSSESSION UTILITY
                       A farmer needs certain outlets to dispose of its surplus production. Agricultural
               marketing system provides means for willing sellers to interact with willing buyers to arrive
               at  market  transactions.  Possession  utility  is  created  by  the  process  of  transferring
               ownership of the product from sellers to buyers at the right time. This utility is created and
               supported by many people in the marketing channel.

               ANALYSIS OF AGRICULTURAL MARKETING SYSTEM
               The analysis of an agricultural marketing system helps in understanding the components
               of  the  system  and  the  interactions  among  these  components.  It  also  facilitates  in
               identifying  the  nature,  type  and  root  cause  of  problems  affecting  the  efficiency  and
               effectiveness  of  the  system.  There  are  various  approaches  to  analyse  agricultural

               problem into its parts so that it is better understood. Following approaches are generally
               used for this purpose:
               1. The functional approach
               2. The institutional approach
               3. The commodity approach
               4. The behavioural system approach
               5. The market structure, conduct, and performance approach
               6. The market mapping approach


                Lesson Proper: Marketing Costs and Margins
               By performing certain functions and services, various marketing organizations and
               agencies make it possible for commodities, produce and products to move from
               producers to consumers. However, these functions incur costs, often of considerable
               magnitude. Discussions on margins and costs usually include the topic of marketing
               efficiency. An efficient marketing system is one capable of moving goods from producer
               to customer at the lowest cost consistent with the provision of the services that
               customers demand. Once the costs involved in marketing have been identified then
               means can be devised to make the system more efficient. Increases in efficiency can be
               achieved in a variety of ways: by increasing the volume of business using improved
               handling methods, investing in modern technology, locating the business in the most
               appropriate place, implementing better layouts and working practices in production,
               improving managerial planning and control and/or by making changes in marketing
               arrangements (e.g. through horizontal or vertical integration).

               Objectives of the Chapter
               The chapter is aimed at enabling the reader to:-

                   •  Understand what the term marketing efficiency means and the varied forms it can
                       take
                   •  Distinguish between marketing efficiency and marketing effectiveness
                   •  Identify the factors which influence the level of efficiency and level of
                       effectiveness of a marketing system, and
                   •  Determine how marketing costs and margins can be calculated.

               Structure of the Chapter


               The chapter begins with an overview of the twin concepts of marketing efficiency and
               effectiveness before examining the different forms which marketing efficiency takes, i.e.
               operational efficiency and pricing efficiency. There then follows a discussion of the
               reference product concept which allows marketing managers and industrial analysts to
               compare costs, margin and efficiency levels at different stages of the marketing system.
               The remainder of the chapter is largely comprised of an explanation, and illustrations of

               account product losses, the production of by-products as well as production,
               processing, handling, storage, transportation, packaging and capital costs.


               Assessing the performance of a marketing system

               It might be thought that the performance of a marketing system could be evaluated in
               terms of how well the agricultural and food marketing system performs what society and
               the market participants expect of it. However, it soon becomes apparent that marketing
               systems have multiple and often conflicting goals. Compromises and trade-offs will be
               necessary if the various participants in the marketing system are to be satisfied. For
               example, consider the perspectives of just three parties involved in agricultural
               marketing systems consumers, farmers, society and government. Consumers are likely
               to evaluate a marketing system in terms of its performance in avoiding high and
               fluctuating prices, shortages in supply and consistency in delivering products or produce
               of acceptable quality. Farmers' concerns could be rather different. Their criteria might
               include the capacity of intermediaries to exert undue influence on prices, the extent of
               competition in the sectors supplying farm inputs and accessibility of marketing
               infrastructure at reasonable cost (e.g. suitable storage and transportation). Society is
               likely to give consideration to the marketing system's contribution to employment, its
               impact on the environment and the ethical standards to which it is perceived to adhere.
               Government's perceptions of a marketing system will also be coloured by its impact on
               employment. In addition, government will probably take into account the sector's
               contribution to investment, economic growth and the national treasury through its
               taxable income. In the case of staple foods, governments will also be greatly interested
               in a marketing system's ability to avert protests from the electorate against unaffordable
               food prices. Given these different perspectives there are several contrasting measures
               which are commonly used in assessing the performance of a marketing system. These
               are:


                   •  the farmer's/grower's share of the retail price paid by the end user or consumer
                   •  the gross marketing margin or farm-retail price spread, and
                   •  the proportion of a consumer's income which must be spent on food.


               Whatever the perspective from which a marketing system's performance is evaluated,
               the terms most commonly used are efficiency and effectiveness. These are not one and
               the same thing.


                 Marketing Efficiency and Effectiveness

               A marketing system can be effective without being efficient. An example of such a
               system is that created by Indonesia's parastatal Bulog. Indonesia is a country
               comprised of thousands of islands (not all of which are inhabited). Bulog was charged
               with the onerous responsibility of physically distributing rice and ensuring that everyone
               was supplied with their basic food requirement. (Hence the name, Bureau of Logistics,
               Bulog). Before Indonesia became capable of self-sufficiency in the staple food, the sole

                                                           - 103 -]]></page><page Index="192"><![CDATA[criterion of Bulog's success or failure was of its effectiveness in delivering rice to where
               it was needed. The costs in doing so were a secondary consideration as long as Bulog
               could keep its costs within whatever budget could be made available to it.


               Increased efficiency is in the best interests of farmers, traders, processors, wholesalers,
               retailers, consumers and society as a whole. The efficiency of a marketing system is
               measured in terms of the level and/or costs to the system of the inputs, to achieve a
               given level and/or quality of output. Such inputs are generally in the form of land,
               finance, time, manpower and materials. Typical outputs include the movement of a
               given amount of product to markets at specific distances, the supply of a particular level
               of service to target market segments and the supply of products at a target price. Hence
               resources are the costs and utilities are the benefits that comprise the marketing
               efficiency ratio. Efficient marketing optimises the ratio between inputs and outputs.

               Operational efficiency


               Improved operational efficiency is evident where marketing costs are reduced but
               outputs are either maintained or actually increase. Examples of operational efficiency
               gains would be the introduction of a less expensive method of storing grain or an
               innovative milk package that reduces energy costs when the product sits in retailers'
               refrigerators. Technological innovations are not the only avenue leading to higher levels
               of operational efficiency. An organisation that improves its raw material procurement
               practices, by say centralising purchases, buying in larger quantities or taking advantage
               of unit freight rates, is likely to increase operating efficiency. In the same way, an
               organisation that rearranges sales territories and distributes fewer but larger loads to
               each delivery point can improve its levels of operational efficiency. Physical losses as
               commodities, produce or products move through the channels of distribution are
               another aspect of operational efficiency. The higher the losses, the lower the level of
               operational efficiency.

               efforts to increase the customer's utility often affect marketing costs. A new marketing
               practice that reduces costs but also reduces consumers' satisfaction may actually
               reduce the efficiency ratio. For instance, millers might improve efficiency by withdrawing
               5 kg bags of meal from the market and sell minimum quantities of 10 kg bags. If a
               substantial number of consumers prefer to buy the 5 kg bag then the decrease in
               customer satisfaction could be greater than the gains made in cost reduction to the
               miller. The compromise which must be made between operational efficiency and
               customer satisfaction explains the difficulty of improving marketing efficiency. It is not
               difficult to reduce marketing costs by taking such measures as reducing the number of
               pack/bag sizes, eliminating packaging or reducing the number of retail outlets supplied
               but there may be a greater loss in customer satisfaction than is compensated for by the
               fall in marketing costs and retail prices. When evaluating any marketing change
               intended to improve marketing efficiency, both cost reductions and customer utility must
               be considered.
               Marketing firms, operating within a competitive environment, are especially well
               motivated in seeking to increase operational efficiency. Although their goal may be
               higher profits, often the benefits of improved operations accrue to customers in the form
               of lower prices. Competition acts as a brake on the extent to which profits increase and
               limits any tendency for customer service and satisfaction levels to fall. was constructed

               from data in Pant's  study of marketing costs and margins for major agricultural
               commodities in Nepal. It will serve to illustrate price spread analysis. Price spread
               analysis draws a distinction between the farmer's share of the price to the end user and
               its reciprocal, the farm-retail price spread. The farm-retail price spread measures the
               gross percentage of the final retail price which accrues to each category of participant in
               an agri-marketing system, other than the farmer, in return for the marketing services
               which they perform.

               The difference in the percentage of the retail price which goes to the farmer is striking.
               Those farmers who grow fresh tomato varieties receive forty percent of the price to the
               consumer but farmers' supplying tomatoes for canning only get twenty percent of the
               consumer's dollar. However, due to the differences in retail prices for these tomatoes,
               both groups of farmers earn $8. Obviously a smaller percentage of a large number can
               match or exceed a large percentage of a smaller number. Thus a lower farmer's share
               of the consumer's dollar does not necessarily mean lower farm prices or returns. The
               grower will be much more interested in dollars than percentages. If the market for
               canned tomatoes was to show increasing demand then total aggregate marketing costs
               of tomatoes would increase and the farmer's share would fall as a percentage. But if
               with this change in the market consumers could be encouraged to buy more tomatoes
               at higher prices then actual returns to growers could increase. In these circumstances
               higher marketing costs could be popular with both consumers and farmers. Kohls and
                   2
               Uhl  hold the view that:

               “It is doubtful that the statistics of the farmer's share merit the attention they receive.
               The important thing is not the size of the share, but the total return received by
               agricultural producers from the sale of their products. Higher marketing costs and a

               standard of living rises, increased demand for more processing and marketing services
               will increase marketing costs.”


               Moreover, the share of the retail price obtained by the various market participants is not
               of itself a measure of their relative efficiency. It is much more likely that these shares
               reflect the amount of value that these parties add as any given commodity passes
               through the marketing system.
               Pricing efficiency
               Pricing efficiency is a second form of marketing efficiency and is based on the
               assumption that competitive markets are efficient. It is concerned with the ability of the
               marketing system to allocate resources and coordinate the entire agricultural/food
               production and marketing process in accordance with consumer directives. The
               evidence of pricing efficiency is efficient resource allocation and maximum economic
               output. Possibly the best measure of the satisfaction-output of the marketing system is
               the price that customers will pay in the marketplace for the produce, commodity or
               product in question. If consumers are willing to pay three cents more per orange for
               orange juice than for fresh oranges, it can be inferred that the process of juicing adds
               three cents of form utility to fresh oranges. The pricing mechanism directly affects
               production, in this instance, by indicating that a certain amount of the available oranges
               should be processed rather than sold as fruit.


                          3
               Kriesberg  says that the usefulness of pricing efficiency measures in evaluating any
               marketing system depends upon four conditions:

                   •  That customers have alternatives from which to choose in the marketplace. In
                       other words, the measure has little relevance to situations where there is an
                       effective monopoly.
                   •  The prices of alternatives adequately reflect the costs of providing them. That is,
                       there are no subsidies hidden or otherwise for competitive products.
                   •  Organisations must be free to enter or leave the market.
                   •  There must be competition between those in the marketplace. For example,
                       cartel-like behaviour should not be in evidence.

               Theory suggests that if markets are operating efficiently then prices of a given product
               will be related over space and time, and between forms. Prices should only differ
               between geographic areas of a country by transportation costs from one point to
               another. Similarly, the price of storable products at one point in time should not exceed
               the price in a previous period in time by more than the cost of storage. And, again, the
               price of a processed product should not exceed the price of the unprocessed equivalent
               by more than the cost of processing.

               Advocates of the pricing efficiency concept believe that prices which do not reflect the
               costs of marketing services are clues to functional deficiencies, chief among them being

                                                           - 107 -]]></page><page Index="196"><![CDATA[monopolistic power. Competition plays an important role in determining pricing
               efficiency. Market oriented organisations compete for custom by lowering marketing
               costs, increasing operational efficiency wherever possible, and at the same time adding
               more utility to the products in order to gain more market share.

               Frequently there are conflicts between the different varieties of efficiency. For example,
               a new technological development may improve a firm's operational efficiency and permit
               it to grow very large. However, this growth may reduce the number of firms and thereby
               affect structure and competition in the industry, and in turn perhaps lower price
               efficiency.
               Identifying marketing costs and margins

               Marketing costs are incurred when commodities move from the farm to the final market,
               whether they are moved by farmers, intermediaries, cooperatives, marketing boards,
               wholesalers, retailers or exporters. With increased urbanisation and industrialisation,
               marketing costs tend to increase relatively to the farmgate price received by the farmer,
               i.e. the product moves greater distances, through more intermediaries and is more
               sophisticated in its packaging. Marketing costs can also reflect the state of a country's
               development in that as standards of living increase, smaller proportions of income are
               expended on raw products of the farm and greater proportions are spent on additional
               and improved marketing services. Increasing the value added means, among other
               things, that more people in developed countries are involved in marketing agricultural
               products than in producing them.

               Marketing costs include labour, transport, packaging, containers, rent, utilities (water
               and energy), advertising, selling expenses, depreciation allowances and interest
               charges. Marketing costs vary from commodity to commodity and product to product.
               There are several factors that individually or collectively account for these differences.
               These include:


                   •  the more waste the greater the proportion of customers' expenditure which goes
                       on marketing costs
                   •  the more perishable the product the greater the marketing costs
                   •  the more processing of the commodity the greater the marketing costs
                   •  the greater the amount of produce handling and transportation the greater the
                       marketing costs.


               From a wide ranging survey of marketing costs in developing countries
               Kaynak  reported on wheat, rice, potatoes, eggs and livestock products. Summary data
                       4
               from this survey are presented in figure 12.2.

                        Marketing Trends in 21st Century
                 1


             Week 1



               Objectives

               After the completion of this lesson, the students will be able to:
               1.  identify the top marketing trends;

               2.  identify the digital marketing trends;
               3.  understand the sense of marketing in digital age;
               4.  understand the companies’ and marketers’ response to the new challenge; and

               5.  explain the orientations company exhibits in the marketplace.

               Overview

               We will address the following questions:
               ✔       What orientations do companies exhibit in the marketplace?

               ✔       How are companies and marketers responding to the new challenges?


               Change is occurring at an accelerating rate; today is not like yesterday, and tomorrow will be
               different  from  today.  Continuing  today’s  strategy  is  risky;  so  is  turning  to  a  new  strategy.
               Therefore, tomorrow’s successful companies will have to heed three certainties:

                   ●   Global forces will continue to affect everyone’s business and personal life.
                   ●   Technology will continue to advance and amaze us.

                   ●   There will be a continuing push toward deregulation of the economic sector.

                   These     three   developments—globalization,      technological     advances,     and

               deregulation— spell endless opportunities. But what is marketing and what does it have to
               do with these issues?


                   Marketing deals with identifying and meeting human and social needs. One of the shortest
               definitions of marketing is “meeting needs profitably.” Whether the marketer is Procter &
               Gamble, which notices that people feel overweight and want tasty but less fatty food and

               invents Olestra; or CarMax, which notes that people want more certainty when they buy a
               used automobile and invents a new system for selling used cars; or IKEA, which notices that

               people want good furniture at a substantially lower price and creates knock-down furniture—
               all  illustrate  a  drive  to  turn  a  private  or  social  need  into  a  profitable  business  opportunity
               through marketing.

               COMPANY ORIENTATIONS TOWARD THE MARKETPLACE

               Marketing management is the conscious effort to achieve desired exchange outcomes with
               target  markets.  But  what  philosophy  should  guide  a  company’s  marketing  efforts?  What

               relative  weights  should  be  given  to  the  often  conflicting  interests  of  the  organization,
               customers, and society?

               For example, one of Dexter Corporation’s most popular products was a profitable grade of
               paper used in tea bags. Unfortunately, the materials in this paper accounted for 98 percent of
               Dexter’s hazardous wastes. So while Dexter’s product was popular with customers, it was also

               detrimental to the environment. Dexter assigned an employee task force to tackle this problem.
               The  task  force  succeeded,  and  the  company  increased  its  market  share  while  virtually
               eliminating hazardous waste.


               Clearly,  marketing  activities  should  be  carried  out  under  a  well-thought-out  philosophy  of

               efficient,  effective,  and  socially  responsible  marketing.  In  fact,  there  are  five  competing
               concepts  under  which  organizations  conduct  marketing  activities:  production  concept,
               product concept, selling concept, marketing concept, and societal marketing concept.


               The Production Concept

                       The production concept, one of the oldest in business, holds that consumers prefer
               products  that  are  widely  available  and  inexpensive.  Managers  of  production-oriented
               businesses  concentrate  on  achieving  high  production  efficiency,  low  costs,  and  mass

               distribution. This orientation makes sense in developing countries, where consumers are more
               interested in obtaining the product than in its features. It is also used when a company wants
               to expand the market. Texas Instruments is a leading exponent of this concept. It concentrates

               on building production volume and upgrading technology in order to bring costs down, leading
               to lower prices and expansion of the market. This orientation has also been a key strategy of
               many Japanese companies.


               The Product Concept

                       Other businesses are guided by the product concept, which holds that consumers favor
               those products that offer the most quality, performance, or innovative features. Managers in
               these  organizations  focus  on  making  superior  products  and  improving  them  over  time,

               assuming  that  buyers  can  appraise  quality  and  performance.  Product-oriented  companies
               often design their products with little or no customer input, trusting that their engineers can

               design exceptional products. A General Motors executive said years ago: “How can the public
               know what kind of car they want until they see what is available?” GM today asks customers
               what they value in a car and includes marketing people in the very beginning stages of design.


                                                            8]]></page><page Index="206"><![CDATA[MKTG 85 – Special Topics in Marketing Management

               However, the product concept can lead to marketing myopia. Railroad management thought
               that travelers wanted trains rather than transportation and overlooked the growing competition

               from airlines, buses, trucks, and automobiles. Colleges, department stores, and the post office
               all assume that they are offering the public the right product and wonder why their sales slip.

               These organizations too often are looking into a mirror when they should be looking out of the
               window.


               The Selling Concept
                       The selling concept, another common business orientation, holds that consumers and

               businesses, if left alone, will ordinarily not buy enough of the organization’s products. The
               organization  must,  therefore,  undertake  an  aggressive  selling  and  promotion  effort.  This
               concept assumes that consumers must be coaxed into buying, so the company has a battery

               of selling and promotion tools to stimulate buying.

                       The selling concept is practiced most aggressively with unsought goods—goods that
               buyers  normally  do  not  think  of  buying,  such  as  insurance  and  funeral  plots.  The  selling

               concept is also practiced in the nonprofit area by fund-raisers, college admissions offices, and
               political parties. Most firms practice the selling concept when they have overcapacity. Their

               aim is to sell what they make rather than make what the market wants. In modern industrial
               economies, productive capacity has been built up to a point where most markets are buyer
               markets (the buyers are dominant) and sellers have to scramble for customers. Prospects are

               bombarded with sales messages. As a result, the public often identifies marketing with hard
               selling and advertising. But marketing based on hard selling carries high risks. It assumes that
               customers who are coaxed into buying a product will like it; and if they don’t, that they won’t

               bad-mouth it or complain to consumer organizations and will forget their disappointment and
               buy it again. These are indefensible assumptions. In fact, one study showed that dissatisfied
               customers may bad-mouth the product to 10 or more acquaintances; bad news travels fast,

               something marketers that use hard selling should bear in mind.


               The Marketing Concept
                       The  marketing  concept,  based  on  central  tenets  crystallized  in  the  mid-1950s,

               challenges  the  three  business  orientations  we  just  discussed.18  The  marketing  concept
               holds  that  the  key  to  achieving  organizational  goals  consists  of  the  company  being  more
               effective than its competitors in creating, delivering, and communicating customer value to its

               chosen target markets. Theodore Levitt of Harvard drew a perceptive contrast between the
               selling and marketing concepts: “Selling focuses on the needs of the seller; marketing on the
               needs of the buyer. Selling is preoccupied with the seller’s need to convert his product into

               cash; marketing with the idea of satisfying the needs of the customer by means of the product
               and the whole cluster of things associated with creating, delivering and finally consuming it.”

                                                            9]]></page><page Index="207"><![CDATA[MKTG 85 – Special Topics in Marketing Management

                       The  marketing  concept  rests  on  four  pillars:  target  market,  customer  needs,
               integrated marketing, and profitability. The selling concept takes an inside-out perspective.

               It  starts  with  the  factory,  focuses  on  existing  products,  and  calls  for  heavy  selling  and
               promoting to produce profitable sales. The marketing concept takes an outside-in perspective.

               It starts with a well-defined market, focuses on customer needs, coordinates activities that
               affect customers, and produces profits by satisfying customers.

               1.  Target Market
                       Companies do best when they choose their target market(s) carefully and prepare
               tailored marketing programs. For example, when cosmetics giant Estee Lauder recognized

               the increased buying power of minority groups, its Prescriptives subsidiary launched an “All
               Skins” line offering 115 foundation shades for different skin tones. Prescriptives credits All
               Skins for a 45 percent sales increase since this product line was launched.


               2.  Customer Needs
                       A company can carefully define its target market yet fail to correctly understand the

               customers’ needs. Clearly, understanding customer needs and wants is not always simple.
               Some customers have needs of which they are not fully conscious; some cannot articulate

               these needs or use words that require some interpretation.
                       We can distinguish among five types of needs: (1) stated needs, (2) real needs, (3)
               unstated needs, (4) delight needs, and (5) secret needs. Responding only to the stated need

               may shortchange the customer.
                       For example, if a customer enters a hardware store and asks for a sealant to seal glass
               window panes, she is stating a solution, not a need. If the salesperson suggests that tape

               would provide a better solution, the customer may appreciate that the salesperson met her
               need  and  not  her  stated  solution.  A  distinction  needs  to  be  drawn  between  responsive
               marketing,  anticipative  marketing,  and  creative  marketing.  A  responsive  marketer  finds  a

               stated need and fills it, while an anticipative marketer looks ahead to the needs that customers
               may have in the near future. In contrast, a creative marketer discovers and produces solutions

               that customers did not ask for, but to which they enthusiastically respond. Sony exemplifies a
               creative marketer because it has introduced many successful new products that customers
               never asked for or even thought were possible: Walkmans, VCRs, and so on. Sony goes

               beyond customer-led marketing: It is a market-driving firm, not just a market-driven firm. Akio
               Morita, its founder, proclaimed that he doesn’t serve markets; he creates markets.

                       Why is it supremely important to satisfy the needs of target customers? Because a
               company’s sales come from two groups: new customers and repeat customers. One estimate
               is that attracting a new customer can cost five times as much as pleasing an existing one. And

               it might cost 16 times as much to bring the new customer to the same level of profitability as
               that of the lost customer. Customer retention is thus more important than customer attraction.

                                                           10]]></page><page Index="208"><![CDATA[MKTG 85 – Special Topics in Marketing Management


               3.  Integrated Marketing
                       When  all  of  the  company’s  departments  work  together  to  serve  the  customers’

               interests, the result is integrated marketing. Integrated marketing takes place on two levels.

                       First,  the  various  marketing  functions—sales  force,  advertising,  customer  service,

               product management, marketing research—must work together. All of these functions must
               be coordinated from the customer’s point of view.


                       Second, marketing must be embraced by the other departments. According to David
               Packard of Hewlett-Packard: “Marketing is far too important to be left only to the marketing

               department!” Marketing is not a department so much as a companywide orientation. Xerox,
               for example, goes so far as to include in every job description an explanation of how each job
               affects the customer. Xerox factory managers know that visits to the factory can help sell a

               potential customer if the factory is clean and efficient. Xerox accountants know that customer
               attitudes are affected by Xerox’s billing accuracy. To foster teamwork among all departments,
               the  company  must  carry  out  internal  marketing  as  well  as  external  marketing.  External

               marketing is marketing directed at people outside the company. Internal marketing is the task
               of hiring, training, and motivating able employees who want to serve customers well. In fact,
               internal marketing must precede external marketing. It makes no sense to promise excellent

               service before the company’s staff is ready to provide it. Managers who believe the customer
               is the company’s only true “profit center” consider the traditional organization chart—a pyramid

               with the CEO at the top, management in the middle, and front-line people and customers at
               the bottom—obsolete.  Master marketing companies invert the chart, putting customers at the
               top. Next in importance are the front-line people who meet, serve, and satisfy the customers;

               under them are the middle managers, who support the front-line people so they can serve the
               customers; and at the base is top management, whose job is to hire and support good middle

               managers.

               4.  Profitability

                       The ultimate purpose of the marketing concept is to help organizations achieve their
               objectives. In the case of private firms, the major objective is profit; in the case of nonprofit

               and public organizations, it is surviving and attracting enough funds to perform useful work.
               Private firms should aim to achieve profits as a consequence of creating superior customer
               value, by satisfying customer needs better than competitors. For example, Perdue Farms has

               achieved above-average margins marketing chicken—a commodity if there ever was one! The
               company has always aimed to control breeding and other factors in order to produce tender-
               tasting chickens for which discriminating customers will pay more.




                                                           11]]></page><page Index="209"><![CDATA[MKTG 85 – Special Topics in Marketing Management

                       How many companies actually practice the marketing concept? Unfortunately, too few
               only  a  handful  of  companies  stand  out  as  master  marketers:  Procter  &  Gamble,  Disney,

               Nordstrom, Wal-Mart, Milliken & Company, McDonald’s, Marriott Hotels, American Airlines,
               and several Japanese (Sony, Toyota, Canon) and European companies (IKEA, Club Med,

               Nokia, ABB, Marks & Spencer). These companies focus on the customer and are organized
               to  respond  effectively  to  changing  customer  needs.  They  all  have  well-staffed  marketing
               departments,  and  all  of  their  other  departments—manufacturing,  finance,  research  and

               development, personnel, purchasing—accept the customer as king. Most companies do not
               embrace the marketing concept until driven to it by circumstances. Various developments prod

               them to take the marketing concept to heart, including sales declines, slow growth, changing
               buying patterns, more competition, and higher expenses. Despite the benefits, firms face three
               hurdles in converting to a marketing orientation: organized resistance, slow learning, and fast

               forgetting.  Some  company  departments  (often  manufacturing,  finance,  and  research  and
               development) believe a stronger marketing function threatens their power in the organization.
               Resistance is especially strong in industries in which marketing is being introduced for the first

               time—for instance, in law offices, colleges, deregulated industries, and government agencies.
               In spite of the resistance, many companies manage to introduce some marketing thinking into
               their  organization.  Over  time,  marketing  emerges  as  the  major  function.  Ultimately,  the

               customer becomes the controlling function, and with that view, marketing can emerge as the
               integrative function within the organization.


               The Societal Marketing Concept
                       Some have questioned whether the marketing concept is an appropriate philosophy in

               an age of environmental deterioration, resource shortages, explosive population growth, world
               hunger and poverty, and neglected social services. Are companies that successfully satisfy

               consumer wants necessarily acting in the best, long-run interests of consumers and society?
               The marketing concept sidesteps the potential conflicts among consumer wants, consumer
               interests,  and  long-run  societal  welfare.  Yet  some  firms  and  industries  are  criticized  for
               satisfying consumer wants at society’s expense.

                       Such situations call for a new term that enlarges the marketing concept. We propose
               calling  it  the  societal  marketing  concept,  which  holds  that  the  organization’s  task  is  to

               determine  the  needs,  wants,  and  interests  of  target  markets  and  to  deliver  the  desired
               satisfactions  more  effectively  and  efficiently  than  competitors  in  a  way  that  preserves  or
               enhances the consumer’s and the society’s well-being. The societal marketing concept calls

               upon marketers to build social and ethical considerations into their marketing practices. They
               must  balance  and  juggle  the  often  conflicting  criteria  of  company  profits,  consumer  want

               satisfaction, and public interest. Yet a number of companies have achieved notable sales and
               profit  gains  by  adopting  and  practicing  the  societal  marketing  concept.  Some  companies


                                                           12]]></page><page Index="210"><![CDATA[MKTG 85 – Special Topics in Marketing Management

               practice a form of the societal marketing concept called cause-related marketing. Pringle and
               Thompson define this as “activity by which a company with an image, product, or service to

               market builds a relationship or partnership with a ‘cause,’ or a number of ‘causes,’ for mutual
               benefit.” They see it as affording an opportunity for companies to enhance their corporate

               reputation, raise brand awareness, increase customer loyalty, build sales, and increase press
               coverage.  They  believe  that  customers  will  increasingly  look  for  demonstrations  of  good
               corporate citizenship. Smart companies will respond by adding “higher order” image attributes

               than  simply  rational  and  emotional  benefits.  Critics,  however,  complain  that  cause-related
               marketing might make consumers feel they have fulfilled their philanthropic duties by buying

               products instead of donating to causes directly.

               HOW BUSINESS AND MARKETING ARE CHANGING


                       We can say with some confidence that “the marketplace isn’t what it used to be.” It is

               changing radically as a result of major forces such as technological advances, globalization,
               and deregulation. These forces have created new behaviors and challenges: How Business
               and Marketing are Changing Customers increasingly expect higher quality and service and

               some  customization.  They  perceive  fewer  real  product  differences  and  show  less  brand
               loyalty. They can obtain extensive product information from the Internet and other sources,
               permitting them to shop more intelligently. They are showing greater price sensitivity in their

               search for value.

               Brand  manufacturers  are  facing  intense  competition  from  domestic  and  foreign  brands,

               which is resulting in rising promotion costs and shrinking profit margins. They are being further
               buffeted by powerful retailers who command limited shelf space and are putting out their own

               store brands in competition with national brands.

               Store-based retailers are suffering from an oversaturation of retailing. Small retailers are

               succumbing to the growing power of giant retailers and “category killers.” Store-based retailers
               are facing growing competition from direct-mail firms; newspaper, magazine, and TV direct-

               to-customer  ads;  home shopping TV;  and  the Internet.  As  a result,  they  are  experiencing
               shrinking margins. In response, entrepreneurial retailers are building entertainment into stores
               with  coffee  bars,  lectures,  demonstrations,  and  performances,  marketing  an  “experience”

               rather than a product assortment.


               Company Responses and Adjustments
               Given these changes, companies are doing a lot of soul-searching, and many highly respected
               firms are adjusting in a number of ways. Here are some current trends:


                                                           13]]></page><page Index="211"><![CDATA[MKTG 85 – Special Topics in Marketing Management


               1.  Reengineering:  From  focusing  on  functional  departments  to  reorganizing  by  key

                   processes, each managed by multidiscipline teams.
               2.  Outsourcing: From making everything inside the company to buying more products from

                   outside  if  they  can  be  obtained  cheaper  and  better.  Virtual  companies  outsource
                   everything, so they own very few assets and, therefore, earn extraordinary rates of return.
               3.  E-commerce: From attracting customers to stores and having salespeople call on offices

                   to making virtually all products available on the Internet. Business-to-business purchasing
                   is  growing  fast  on  the  Internet,  and  personal  selling  can  increasingly  be  conducted

                   electronically.
               4.  Benchmarking: From relying on self-improvement to studying world-class performers and
                   adopting best practices.

               5.  Alliances: From trying to win alone to forming networks of partner firms.
               6.  Partner–suppliers: From using many suppliers to using fewer but more reliable suppliers
                   who work closely in a “partnership” relationship with the company.

               7.  Market-centered: From organizing by products to organizing by market segment.
               8.  Global and local: From being local to being both global and local.
               9.  Decentralized:  From  being  managed  from  the  top  to  encouraging  more  initiative  and

                   “entrepreneurship” at the local level.


               Marketer Responses and Adjustments
               As  the  environment  changes  and  companies  adjust,  marketers  also  are  rethinking  their
               philosophies, concepts, and tools. Here are the major marketing themes at the start of the new

               millennium:
                   1.  Relationship  marketing:  From  focusing  on  transactions  to  building  long-term,

                       profitable customer relationships. Companies focus on their most profitable customers,
                       products, and channels.
                   2.  Customer lifetime value: From making a profit on each sale to making profits by
                       managing  customer  lifetime  value.  Some  companies  offer  to  deliver  a  constantly

                       needed product on a regular basis at a lower price per unit because they will enjoy the
                       customer’s business for a longer period.

                   3.  Customer  share:  From  a  focus  on  gaining  market  share  to  a  focus  on  building
                       customer share. Companies build customer share by offering a larger variety of goods
                       to their existing customers and by training employees in cross-selling and up-selling.

                   4.  Target marketing: From selling to everyone to trying to be the best firm serving well-
                       defined  target  markets.  Target  marketing  is  being  facilitated  by  the  proliferation  of

                       special-interest magazines, TV channels, and Internet newsgroups.

                   5.  Individualization: From selling the same offer in the same way to everyone in the
                       target market to individualizing and customizing messages and offerings.

                   6.  Customer  database:  From  collecting  sales  data  to  building  a  data  warehouse  of
                       information about individual customers’ purchases, preferences, demographics, and

                       profitability. Companies can “data-mine” their proprietary databases to detect different
                       customer need clusters and make differentiated offerings to each cluster.
                   7.  Integrated marketing communications: From reliance on one communication tool

                       such as advertising to blending several tools to deliver a consistent brand image to
                       customers at every brand contact.

                   8.  Channels as partners: From thinking of intermediaries as customers to treating them
                       as partners in delivering value to final customers.
                   9.  Every  employee  is  a  marketer:  From  thinking  that  marketing  is  done  only  by

                       marketing, sales, and customer support personnel to recognizing that every employee
                       must be customer-focused.
                   10. Model-based decision making: From making decisions on intuition or slim data to

                       basing decisions on models and facts on how the marketplace works.

                   Successful  companies  will  change  their  marketing  as  fast  as  their  market  places  and

               market spaces change, so they can build customer satisfaction, value, and retention.


                   The combination of technology, globalization, and deregulation is influencing customers,
               brand  manufacturers,  and  store-based  retailers  in  a  variety  of  ways.  Responding  to  the
               changes and new demands brought on by these forces has caused many companies to make

               adjustments. In turn, savvy marketers must also alter their marketing activities, tools, and
               approaches to keep pace with the changes they will face today and tomorrow.

                      Introduction to Comprehensive Marketing Plan
                    2





            Week 2



               Objectives
               After the completion of this lesson, the students will be able to:

               1.  Explain the meaning of marketing plan
               2.  Identify the parts of the marketing plan
               3.  determine the products or services to be conducted for a marketing plan


               Overview
               The most important part of a business plan is the Marketing Plan. To keep one’s business on

               course this plan must be geared toward the business’s mission—its product and service
               lines, its markets, its financial situation and marketing/sales tactics.


               The business must be aware of its strengths and weaknesses through internal and external
               analysis and look for market opportunities.

                   ●  The business must analyze its products and services from the viewpoint of the
                      customer—outside-in thinking. What is the customer looking for and what does
                      the customer want (benefits)? The business must gain knowledge of the

                      marketplace from its customers.
                   ●  The business must analyze its target markets. What other additional markets can the
                      business tap into and are there additional products or services the business  can add?

                   ●  The  business  must  know  its  competition,  current  and  potential.  By  identifying  the
                      competitor’s strengths and weaknesses the business can improve its position in the
                      marketplace.

                   ●  The  business  must  make  decisions  on  how  to  apply  its  resources  to  the  target
                      market(s).

                   ●  The business must utilize the information it has gathered about itself, its customers, its
                      markets,  and  its  competition  by  developing  a  written  Marketing  Plan  that  provides
                      measurable goals. The business must select marketing/sales tactics that will allow it to

                      achieve or surpass its goals.
                   ●  The  business  must  implement  the  plan  (within  an  established  budget)  and  then

                      measure its success in terms of whether or not the goals were met (or the extent to
                                                           16]]></page><page Index="214"><![CDATA[MKTG 85 – Special Topics in Marketing Management

                      which they were). The Marketing Plan is an ongoing tool designed to help the business
                      compete in the market for customers. It should be re-visited, re-worked, and re-created

                      often.


               According to Philip Kotler, “Marketing Management is the art and science of choosing target
               markets and building profitable relationship with them. Marketing management is a process
               involving analysis, planning, implementing and control and it covers goods, services, ideas

               and the goal is to produce satisfaction to the parties involved.


               Marketing Management Involves:
               1. The setting of marketing goals and objectives,
               2. Developing the marketing plan,

               3. Organizing the marketing function,
               4. Putting the marketing plan into action and
               5. Controlling the marketing program


               Marketing Management is both a science as well as an art. Those responsible for marketing
               should  have  good  understanding  of  the  various  concepts  and  practices  in  marketing,

               communication,  and  analytical  skills  and  ability  to  maintain  effective  relationship  with
               customers, which will enable them to plan and execute marketing plans.


               Continuous practice in the areas of personal selling, sales promotion, advertising, etc. would
               enable them to become artists. Scientific and artistic aspects of marketing would influence

               each other, leading to a new generation of marketing managers.


               What is Marketing Management – Concept
               This concept advocates that a manufacturer should begin his task with the consumer focus.
               He has to primarily study the consumer and understand the needs, desires, requirements and

               conveniences of the latter. A manufacturer should design a new product or improve an existing
               one strictly keeping in mind the needs, desires etc. of the consumer. The product should

               exactly satisfy the consumer.

               Steps in the Marketing Process

               The marketing process consists of analyzing market opportunities, researching and
               selecting target markets, designing marketing strategies, planning marketing programs, and
               organizing, implementing, and controlling the marketing effort. The four steps in the

               marketing process are:

               1. Analyzing market opportunities

                                                           17]]></page><page Index="215"><![CDATA[MKTG 85 – Special Topics in Marketing Management

                              The marketer’s initial task is to identify potential long-run opportunities given
                       the  company’s  market  experience  and  core  competencies.  To  evaluate  its  various

                       opportunities, assess buyer wants and needs, and gauge market size, the firm needs
                       a marketing research and information system. Next, the firm studies consumer markets

                       or business markets to find out about buying behavior, perceptions, wants, and needs.
                       Smart firms also pay close attention to competitors and look for major segments within
                       each market that they can profitably serve.


               2. Developing marketing strategies

                               In this step, the marketer prepares a positioning strategy for each new and

                       existing product’s progress through the life cycle, makes decisions about product lines
                       and branding, and designs and markets its services.

               3. Planning marketing programs


                       To transform marketing strategy into marketing programs, marketing managers must:

                    ●  Make  basic  decisions  on  marketing  expenditures,  marketing  mix,  and  marketing
                       allocation. The first decision is about the level of marketing expenditures needed to

                       achieve the firm’s marketing objectives.
                    ●  The second decision is how to divide the total marketing budget among the various

                       tools in the marketing mix: product, price, place, and promotion.
                    ●  And the third decision is how to allocate the marketing budget to the various products,
                       channels, promotion media, and sales areas.


               4. Managing the marketing effort.

                               In this step, marketers organize the firm’s marketing resources to implement

                       and  control  the  marketing  plan.  Because  of  surprises  and  disappointments  as
                       marketing plans are implemented, the company also needs feedback and control.


               WHY DEVELOP A MARKETING PLAN?

               Your marketing plan is an essential part of your overall business. When you are starting a

               business or introducing new products or concepts, this plan can help you:

                   ●  Assess the needs of your customers, and develop a product or service to meet these

                       needs.
                   ●  Communicate the attributes of the product or service to the customer.
                   ●  Establish distribution channels to get the products/services to the customer.


                   Developing your marketing plan will help you identify aspects of marketing that are easy
               to overlook. To produce a sound plan you will need to outline who your customers are, how

                                                           18]]></page><page Index="216"><![CDATA[MKTG 85 – Special Topics in Marketing Management

               they will buy your product or hire your services , and why. Your banker or lender will also want
               to see the marketing section of your business plan before considering lending you money.


                   Styles, markets, and goals change and so should your plan. Revisit your marketing plan
               on a regular basis to keep it current, and adjust it according to changes in your business

               activities or predictions of new trends.



               BEFORE WRITING YOUR MARKETING PLAN


               Market research

               Before you develop your marketing plan, research the potential market for your product or
               service.  Use  the  numbers,  facts  and  findings  to  back  up  statements  in  your  marketing

               plan.  You can also design a questionnaire, create an online survey, and search available
               databases and other resources to find the information you need to build your marketing plan.

                  3       Marketing Plan (Part 1): Industry Overview


             Week 3




               Objectives
               After the completion of this lesson, the students will be able to:

               1. explain the industry concept;
               2. analyze the market size;
               3. analyze the market shares: and

               4. describe the market trends for the past 3-5 years.

               Overview

                       An industry is a group of companies that are related based on their primary business
               activities.  In  modern  economies,  there  are  dozens  of  industry  classifications,  which  are
               typically grouped into larger categories called sectors.


                       Individual companies are generally classified into an industry based on their largest

               sources of revenue. For example, while an automobile manufacturer might have a financing
               division that contributes 10% to the firm's overall revenues, the company would be classified
               in the automaker industry by most classification systems.


                       Industry overview provides a look at your business's industry and highlights your place

               within it. The marketing plan should present well-researched information to display that you
               understand the industry well. When you’re considering starting a new business or entering a
               new industry, it’s wise to do your research. An industry analysis is an integral part of marketing
               plan.

                       Industry analysis allows you to assess the overall industry that you’ve chosen for your
               business. An industry analysis may be a stand-alone report or may be included as part of a

               marketing plan. An industry analysis typically looks at the dominant companies within a given
               industry, supply and demand within the industry, whether the industry is growing, potential
               opportunities within the industry and other social, political and economic factors.


               Importance of an Industry Analysis






                                                           22]]></page><page Index="220"><![CDATA[MKTG 85 – Special Topics in Marketing Management

               An industry analysis helps business owners to develop a strategy to ensure the success of
               their company. Usually completed as part of a marketing plan, an industry analysis can also

               be done if you’re thinking about pivoting your company into a new area or marketing your
               products to a new industry.


               An industry analysis helps you to understand the trends that are taking place in the industry
               today, as well as the historical trends that have led to that moment. Looking back at what the

               industry has been like can help businesses to figure out future trends. Industry analysis also
               enables  business  owners  to  understand  external  factors  that  affect  the  industry,  such  as

               politics,  government  regulations,  economic  forecasts,  technological  advances  and  socio-
               demographic movements.


               Market Size and Market Share

               Market size can be given in volume of product sold or value of products. This can therefore
               be calculated by adding all the different company's sales value or volume together. Market

               share can be used over time to show if a market is growing or declining.

               Market share is the proportion (usually percent) of the total market held by one particular
               company. The company that has the biggest market share is known as the brand leader.

               Market share is a good measure of how successful a company is especially if it is measured
               over time and compared to close competitors.


               Factors which effect the growth of a market are shown below:

                   ●  Increase in spending power,
                   ●  Increased population,

                   ●  Social changes,
                   ●  Changes in fashion,

                   ●  Identifying customer needs.

               Market Trend

               A market trend analysis is an analysis of past and current market behavior and dominant

               patterns of the market and consumers. An important aspect of conducting a trend analysis for
               an organization is to obtain insights on the market scenario, consumer preferences, and the

               macroeconomic environment.

               Trend  analysis  is  a  subset  of  the  PESTEL  Analysis—an  examination  of  the  Political,
               Economic, Social, Technological, Environmental, and Legal implications of the market as they

               relate to consumer trends. This analysis provides an all-round perspective of the external
               factors that impact the business.

               Imagine that the first cell phone has just been released. People are excited and confused by
               the idea of carrying a phone outside of their home. Few people have cell phones, and some

               are uncertain that they will become popular. Fast forward 20 years and the streets are
               dominated by cell phones. A couple years later, the smartphone takes over.


               Take a look around you today, there are smartphones, tablets, and even watches that allow
               you to make phone calls. This change in the communication market is an excellent example
               of a market trend. A market trend is anything that alters the market your company operates

               in.

                    4      Marketing Plan (Part 2): Situational Analysis


               Week 4




               Objectives

               After the completion of this lesson, the students will be able to:
               1. understand the consumer profile;
               2. describe the company profile;

               3. analyze the SWOT; and
               4. describe the collaborators and competitors of the product.



               Overview

                        The situational analysis section is one of the most important parts of a marketing plan.
               It outlines your company goals, strengths and weaknesses; describes your target customers;
               identifies your important partners and distributors; and provides an analysis of the competitive

               environment.

                       The situational analysis section is one of the most important parts of a marketing plan.
               It outlines your company goals, strengths and weaknesses; describes your target customers;

               identifies your important partners and distributors; and provides an analysis of the competitive
               environment.  The  situation  analysis  is  not  an  easy  section  to  write  and  can  take  several

               months of research and planning. If you take the time to do it correctly, however, it can help
               differentiate your product or service in the marketplace.

               A.  Consumer Profile

                   The major component in customer analysis is identifying target market segments that are
                   predisposed to preferring your products over those of your competitors. A market segment
                   is  a  sub-set  of  a  market  made  up  of  people  or  organizations  with  one  or  more

                   characteristics  that  cause  them  to  demand  similar  product  and/or  services  based  on
                   qualities  of  those  products  such  as  price  or  function.  A  marketing  program  aimed  at

                   individual segments needs to understand and capitalize on the group's differences and
                   use them strategically in all advertising campaigns.



                                                           25]]></page><page Index="223"><![CDATA[MKTG 85 – Special Topics in Marketing Management

                   Gender, age, ethnicity, geography and income are all market-segmenting criteria based
                   on demographics.


                   Typical questions to ask when determining the demographics of the target market include:

                   * What is the age range of the customer who wants my product or service?
                   * Which gender would be most interested in this product or service?
                   * What is the income level of my potential customers?

                   * What level of education do they have?
                   * What is their marital or family status: Are they married, single, divorced? Do they have

                   kids, grandkids?
                   * What are the hobbies of my target customers?


                   This section includes the following factors:
                       5.  Market Segmentation (demographics, psychographics, buying behavior) and level
                          of satisfaction (measured)

                       6.  Market Needs being addressed
                       7.  Buying patterns
                       8.  Usage Habits


               B.  Company Background

                             A company overview (also known as company information or a company summary)
                   is an essential part of a marketing plan. It’s an overview of the most important points about
                   the product/company—your history, location, mission statement and legal structure and

                   includes the following factors

                       1.  Company Profile
                       2.  Current Position of the Company/Brand in the Market

                       3.  Segmentation, Targeting and Positioning
                       4.  Company/Brand Strengths and Weaknesses Analysis (in terms of 4 Ps)

                       5.  Marketing Strategies / Marketing Mix

               C.  Context / Environmental Analysis

                       SWOT analysis is a technique developed at Stanford in the 1970s, frequently used in
                   strategic planning. SWOT is an acronym for Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and
                   Threats and is a structured planning method that evaluates those four elements of an

                   organization,  project  or  business  venture.  SWOT  analysis  is  a  process  where  the
                   management team identifies the internal and external factors that will affect the company’s
                   future performance. It helps us to identify of what is happening internally and externally,

                   so that you can plan and manage your business in the most effective and efficient manner.

                       TOWS Analysis is a variant of the classic business tool, SWOT Analysis created by
                   Heinz Weihrich. It is a variant of the classic business tool, SWOT Analysis. Both TOWS

                   and SWOT are having the same acronyms for Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and
                   Threats, and in reverse order of the words.

                       TOWS analysis first matches internal factors to external factors to help identify relevant
                   strategic  options  that  an  organisation  could  pursue.  By  combining  the  external
                   environment’s  opportunities  and  threats  with  the  internal  organization’s  strengths  and

                   weaknesses, we can come up with four basic strategies. It can help an organisation to see
                   how it can take advantage of opportunities, reduce threats, overcome weaknesses and

                   exploit any strengths.

                   This section includes the following:

                       1.   Analysis of Opportunities and Threats
                       2.   Key Success Factors

               D. Collaborators


               Next, your situational analysis should include a section that describes the key collaborators
               for the business. Describe any subsidiary, joint venture or partnership strategies you of the
               business.  Then  outline  the  distribution  strategy,  which  defines  how  the  business  get  the

               products  to  market.  For  example,  the  business  may  have  a  warehouse  operation  in  their
               company's headquarters that distributes the product to retail locations via trucks.


                   This section includes the following:
                   1.   Supply Chain Relationship
                   2.   Distribution Channels


               E. Competitors
               The final part of the situation analysis of your marketing plan is the competitive analysis. This

               is  where  you  list  each  of  your  competitors;  describe  their  product  or  service  offering;
               communicate  their  key  features  and  benefits;  discuss  their  position  and  share  in  the
               marketplace; and outline their competitive strengths and weaknesses. A competitive analysis

               is an important part of your marketing plan. It can provide key insights into growth opportunities
               for your company.


                      This section includes the following:
                      1.   Industry Concept of Competition
                      2.   Strengths / Competitive advantage

                   5
                        Marketing Objectives and Overall Marketing Strategy

             Week 5


               Objectives
               After the completion of this lesson, the students will be able to:
               1. create an overall marketing objectives;

               2. create a specific objectives and targets for 3 years; and
               5. create an overall marketing strategy


               Overview
               A marketing plan is not just a document piecing together various bits of information. Your

               marketing plan will be useless unless you set time-marked objectives. Marketing objectives
               are short-term achievements to help you achieve longer-term goals. They should be set on a
               weekly or monthly timeline. These objectives help a business set out what a business wants

               to achieve from its marketing strategy.




               How do you come up with good marketing objectives?

               An effective marketing objective meets the SMART criteria. SMART is a common business
               acronym.


               What is SMART?

               Specific: This should detail exactly what needs to be done. It should be concise and to the
               point.


               Measurable: Your objective needs to be quantifiable. That is, you need to have some method
               of checking your success.

               Achievable: You need to set reasonable objectives. There’s no point in setting objectives you

               cannot meet.

               Realistic: Do you have the proper resources and staff to achieve the objectives you have set?

               You have to be honest with yourself when you’re creating your goals — or they might not be
               achievable.

               Time Specific: You need to define a timeline. Each objective should have a deadline.





                                                           29]]></page><page Index="227"><![CDATA[MKTG 85 – Special Topics in Marketing Management

               D.  Overall and Specific Marketing Objectives


                   In the Marketing Objectives section of your plan document, you spell out your revenue and
               other goals for your marketing efforts for the next 3 years. (and, ideally, beyond), while also
               providing specifics on how you will achieve them.


               As a start, consider that a typical marketing plan has at least four objectives:

                   ●  Lead generation. Finding prospects
                   ●  Brand awareness. Making those prospects aware of your company and its products
                   ●  Brand consideration. Getting prospects to think of you

                   ●  Sales. Convincing prospects to buy from you


               Each  of  your  marketing  objectives  should  include  a  description  of  what  you  intend  to
               accomplish, including concrete, numerical goals with an associated marketing timeline. To set
               these goals, review your past sales numbers, your recent business growth in different markets,

               the size of typical new customers, and how new product introductions have fared. Then use
               those numbers as a guide for the future.


               Restrict the  number  of marketing  objectives  you  set  per  year.  Keep them challenging  but
               achievable. Set modest goals to start so you avoid discouraging your people or yourself. You
               don't want to set an unrealistically high bar.


               Example of overall and specific marketing objectives:



               A.  Overall Marketing Objectives

                     “Kripsy Kreme Doughnuts” will continue to foster growth and increase profitability”




               B.  Specific Objectives and Targets (3 years)

                   1.  Increase market share to 20% in the doughnut industry in the United States and in the

                       international market annually and for the next 3 years.

                   3.  Profits will increase by 20%
                   4.  Kripsy Kreme Doughnuts will continue to be a quick service restaurant. However, we
                       will try to open a sit-down-and-relax restaurant just like any other coffee shops and

                       café, where customers can freely relax while enjoying our doughnuts and coffees to
                       cater our customers who would want to relax after work, or after work meeting with a
                       colleague  or  business  associates/partners.    It  will  add  stores  that  will  have  drive-

                       through to cater those working early in the morning and coming in late from work and
                       some stores which are located in the busiest cities will also open 24-hour store to cater

                       those who are working on a graveyard shifts.



               Overall Marketing Strategy (Positioning Statement)

                       A positioning statement is a concise description of your target market as well as a
               compelling picture of how you want that market to perceive your brand. It helps you maintain

               focus on your brand and its value proposition while you work on market strategy and tactics

               Example of positioning statement:


                       “We  created  a  one-of-a-kind  tasty  doughnut  near  the  hearts  of  our  customers.
               Excellent quality service and flavorful and freshest doughnuts that gives warmth to the hearts
               of our customer is our top commitment as evidenced to our Doughnut Theater where our

               customers  see  how  doughnuts  are  being  made.    Unlike  other  doughnuts,  Krispy  Kreme

               Ps:

                   2.  Price: The amount of money paid by customers to purchase the product.

                                                           32]]></page><page Index="230"><![CDATA[MKTG 85 – Special Topics in Marketing Management

               meet the company’s marketing objectives by providing its customers with value. The 4 Ps of

                           Financial Projections


              Week 7


               Objectives

               After the completion of this lesson, you will be able to:
               1.  realize why sales forecasting is important;
               2.  prepare Projected sales volume/sales amount projections;

               3.  prepare detailed Marketing Budget and Marketing Timetable; and
               4.  prepare Projected Income Statement


               Overview
                            Any  forecast  can  be  termed  as  an  indicator  of  what  is  likely  to  happen  in  a

               specified future time frame in a particular field.  For example, a sales forecast indicates as to
               how much of a particular product is likely to be sold in a specified future period in a specified
               market at a specified price.


                            The Financial Projection is last part of your marketing plan which is to do the
               Forecasted or Projected Income Statement only. It will detail the sales budget, cost of sales

               budget and the administrative and selling expenses budget.

               A.  Sales Forecast
                            Sales  Forecasting  is  the  process  of  estimating  future  sales.    Accurate  sales

                   forecasts enable companies to make informed business decisions and predict short-term
                   and  long-term  performance.    Companies  can  base  their forecasts  on  past  sales  data,
                   industry-wide comparisons, and economic trends.

                            Sales forecast can also be defined as, an estimate of sales in terms of money or
                   physical units for a specified future period under a proposed marketing plan or program

                   and under an assumed set of economic and other forces outside the unit for which the
                   forecast is made.
                            It is easier for established companies to predict future sales based on years of
                   past  business  data.    Newly  founded  companies  have  to  base  their  forecasts  on  less-

                   verified information, such as market research and competitive intelligence to forecast their
                   future business.






               B.  Importance of Sales Forecasting

                            Sales forecasting is very important function for a manufacturing concern, since it
                   is useful in many ways such as:


                   1.  It  helps  to  determine  production  volumes  considering  availability  of  facilities,  like
                       equipment, capital, manpower, space etc.

                   2.  It forms a basis for sales budget, production budget and administrative and selling
                       expenses budget.
                   3.  It facilitates in deciding the extent of advertising and promotion.

                   4.  It is a commitment on the part of the sales and marketing Department and it should be
                       achieved during the given period.
                   6.  It helps in guiding marketing, production and other business activities for achieving

                       these targets.

                   8.  It helps companies plan for future growth.


               C.  How to Create Sales Forecast

                       A  sales  forecast  is  an  estimate  of  the  quantity  of  goods  and  services  you  can
               realistically sell over the forecast period, the cost of the goods and services to be sold and the,
               and the estimated profit.


                   1.  Make a list of the goods and services to be sold

                   2.  Estimate the number or units of each product to be sold
                   3.  Multiply the selling price by the estimated number of goods or services to be sold to
                       get the estimated total sales

                   4.  Determine the cost of each good or service to produce
                   5.  Multiply the cost of each good or service by the estimated number to be sold to get
                       the cost of goods to be sold

                   6.  Subtract the total cost of goods sold from the total sales to arrive at the gross profit

               D.  Sales Forecast Assumptions




                                                           36]]></page><page Index="234"><![CDATA[MKTG 85 – Special Topics in Marketing Management

               There are many factors that can potentially affect sales that should form the basis for your
               forecast, including:


               1.  The economy and your particular industry:  Is the economy slowing? Is the market for
               your  goods  and  services  growing  or  declining?  Is  there  more  competition  entering  the

               marketplace? Are you likely to gain or lose any major customers? Your sales forecast should
               include an estimate of percentage growth or shrinkage in the market.

               2.  Regulatory changes:  sometimes new laws or regulations can affect your sales prospects,

               either positively or negatively.

               3. Your products or services:  Are you launching any new products or services that may
               increase  sales,  or  are  sales  of  your  existing  products/services  declining  due  to  better

               products/services or lower prices from competition?  Will you be forced to raise prices due to
               increased material, labor, or other costs and how might this affect sales?


               4.    Your  marketing  efforts:    Are  you  embarking  on  any  new  marketing  campaigns  or
               spending more or less on advertising?  Perhaps bringing a new company website online,
               beefing up your email marketing, or branching into social media to increase sales?  Are you

               hiring additional sales staff or losing your best salesperson?

               Sales Forecasting for Existing Businesses

                       Sales forecasting for an established business is easier than sales forecasting for a new

               business: the established business already has a sales forecast baseline of past sales.  A
               business’s sales revenues from the same month in a previous year, combined with knowledge

               of  general  economic  and  industry  trends,  work  well  for  predicting  a  business’s  sales  in  a
               particular future month.

                       If  your  business  has  repeat  customers,  you  can  check  with  them  to  see  if  their

               purchase levels are likely to continue in the future.  If you don’t wish to contact them directly
               you can infer future activity based on the health of the customer industry.


               Sales Forecasting for New Businesses

                            Sales  forecasting  for  a  new  business  is  more  problematical  as  there  is  no
               baseline of past sales.  The process of preparing a sales forecast for a new business involves

               researching your target market, your trading area and your competition and analyzing your
               research to guesstimate your future sales.

               There are many methods on how to forecast sales, such as:


               Method # 1 For your specific location, how many households needing your goods or services
               live within let’s say 1 kilometer?  How much will they spend on these items annually, and what
               percentage  of  their  spending  will  you  get,  compared  to  your  competitors?    Do  the  same

                                                           37]]></page><page Index="235"><![CDATA[MKTG 85 – Special Topics in Marketing Management

               analysis for areas within 5 kilometers, using lower sales forecast figures, using distances that
               make sense for your location.


                    Distance             # of             Annual        % of spending        Forecasted
                                     Households          Spending                               Sales

                      1 km                20              120,000             5%             120,000.00

               Estimate Your Costs

               A sales forecast should also include the firm’s direct costs so that profits can be estimated.
               Direct costs vary by product, business, and industry:


                   ▪   For a reseller of goods, the direct cost of each item sold (also known as the cost of
                       goods sold or COGS) is typically the wholesale price (plus shipping if applicable)

                   ▪   For a manufacturer, direct costs include raw materials, labor and overhead.
                   ▪   For a service business, the direct costs are mainly salaries and other expenses.

                                      The Basics of Market Research

                                                                          Week 2 – September 14 - 18, 2020

                “Research is to see what everybody else has seen, and to think what nobody else has thought.”
                                                    --Albert Szent-Gyorgi

               Chapter Learning Outcomes
               By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

                   1.  define market research;
                   2.  determine the role and use of market research to business organizations; and

                   3.  identify the researchable market issues.





                                         The Role and Use of Market Research
                       Customers always have been the most important part of a business. Today, if you do
               not put the customer at the center of your business, you will, over time, have no business. In

               other  words,  market  research  or  market  intelligence  has  always  been  with  us.  However,
               market research is a bit more than the informal assimilation and interpretation of intelligence
               that is a natural consequence of keeping eyes and ears open.

                       According to Philip Kotler, “Marketing research is a systematic problem analysis, model
               building  and  fact  finding  for  the  purpose  of  improved  decision-making  and  control  in  the
               marketing of goods and services.”

                       Specifically, marketing research is the function that links the consumer, customer, and
               public to the marketer through information–information used to identify and define marketing
               opportunities  and  problems;  generate,  refine,  and  evaluate  marketing  actions;  monitor

               marketing performance; and improve understanding of marketing as a process. Marketing
               research specifies the information required to address these issues, designs the method for

               collecting information, manages and implements the data collection process, analyzes the
               results, and communicates the findings and their implications (AMA, 2017).
                       Marketing research is used to answer fundamental questions that affect the future of

               an organization. Therefore, marketing research is a skill needed by all types of organizations,
               both large and small. Small businesses as well as large corporations can benefit from the

               knowledge  that  research  provides.  In  addition,  community,  arts  and  other  non-profit
               organizations can also benefit.
                       Small  businesses  may  believe  that  they  do  not  have  the  resources  to  conduct

               marketing research. However, a small business usually operates on a narrow profit margin]]></page><page Index="256"><![CDATA[4


               leaving it particularly vulnerable to competition. Even losing a small percentage of customers
               can mean potential bankruptcy. Therefore, small businesses need to research what products

               and services customers want and need. In addition, it is essential that they conduct research
               on  a  continual  basis  as  to  what  products  and  services  are  being  offered  by  competing
               businesses.

                       Non-profit  organizations  may  also  feel  that  they  do  not  have  the  time  or  money
               necessary  to  conduct  research.  Yet  all  types  of  non-profit  organizations  can  benefit  from

               conducting  research.  For  example,  community-based  social  service  non-profits  could  use
               research to determine what services are needed by the people they serve. Other non-profits,
               such as arts organizations, face the challenge of finding audiences and can use research to

               help with segmentation and promotion decisions.
                       Large corporations often have internal marketing research departments. Even so, they

               sometimes hire specialized external marketing research firms to conduct research. Marketing
               research  is  especially  necessary  when  corporations  develop  new  products  or  reposition
               current  products.  Research  is  needed to  thoroughly  analyze  consumer needs,  as  a  failed

                                                    Research Issues

                       There are a number of different issues that an organization can choose to research
               (see Table 1.1). Research on the consumer marketplace can be used to determine who is
               buying a specific product. Companies should also consider conducting research regarding

               competitors’ products and services as it can provide valuable information on how a business
               can  improve.  For  example,  organizations  should  analyze  their  customers’  perception  of

               competitors, as such research helps to determine whether companies should add to their own
               products any of the benefits provided by competing products.
                       Market  research  can  determine  the  composition  of  the  current  customer  segment.

               Consumer research can examine customers’ reasons for purchasing and is critical to both
               increasing the current market segment and finding new target markets. Distribution research]]></page><page Index="257"><![CDATA[5


               is conducted to determine if the product is being sold at the right locations. Organizations also
               need to use research to determine if a specific product has the benefits that consumers desire.

               Another important area of research is determining if a product is being effectively promoted.
               Lastly,  determining  the  correct  price  for  a  product  can  make  the  difference  between  a
               successful and unsuccessful product launch. Information gathered on all of these issues will

               help businesses to learn where and how they need to improve.

                       Marketing research focuses on understanding the customer, the company, and the
               competition.  These  relationships  are  at  the  core  of  marketing  research.  Companies  must
               understand  and  respond  to  what  customers  want  from  their  products.  However,  this

               relationship is always influenced by competitors and how their products are received by the
               market.  Thus,  market  researchers  must  clearly  identify  the  customer,  company,  and

               competition before developing a research project.
                       There are several important factors a market researcher must consider before they
               begin, including:

                       •  Customers and competition
                       •  Awareness and image of the product

                       •  Product usage
                       •  Undiagnosed problems with the product

                                                 The Research Process

                       Too  often,  when  a  company  conducts  research  it  begins  without  proper  planning.
               However,  the  chances  of  finding  the  correct  answer  to  a  research  question  are  greatly

               increased by following a specific six-step process (see Figure 2.1). The process starts with
               determining what the organization needs to know and where it can find the information. In
               addition, researchers must determine who will participate in the research and the number of

               participants that will be needed. Researchers must then decide what research approach is
               appropriate for the research question and must choose the most suitable research method.

               They must then plan the process of conducting the research. After the research is conducted,
               the final step will be to analyse and report the findings and recommendations.

                                               1. Determine the research question



                                          2. Decide on the sources of information sample

               Determine the Research Question
                       The  first  step,  designing  the  research  question,  is  generally  difficult  and  time

               consuming. Because organizations are often in a hurry for answers, the temptation is to start
               the research process before determining what they really need to know. As a result, they may
               either  ask  a  poorly  defined  research  question or  even the  wrong  question  entirely.  To  be

               effective, a research study must be both well designed and narrowly focused. If the research
               question is too broad, too much information will be obtained. In addition, the large amount of

               resulting data will be difficult to analyze and, therefore, of little use to an organization. Even
               worse,  if  the  wrong  question  is  asked,  the  wrong  information  will  be  obtained  and  all  the
               research effort will be wasted.

               Sources of Information
                       Researchers need to put considerable thought into planning the sources from which

               information can be obtained. The different sources for data are categorized as secondary (data
               that already exist because it has been collected by someone else) and primary (data that the
               researcher collects). In addition, secondary data can be categorized as internal (which the

               company already has) and external (which must be gathered from other sources). Sometimes,
               an organization may even have already collected enough data to answer their question. In
               other  cases,  the  answer  to  a research  question  might  already  be  available  as  a  result  of

               research conducted by other organizations.
                       However, even if a research question is not answered, collecting secondary data can
               help with the design of a primary research method. A researcher will collect primary data

               directly from participants to answer a specific research question. Primary data are usually
               collected  from  a  group  of  participants  called  a  sample.  This  sample  consists  of  selected

               members from an entire group of individuals, which is called a population. These selected
               members can be defined by demographic characteristics such as age, gender, or occupation.
               They also might be defined by psychographic characteristics such as lifestyle or opinions. In

               addition,  they  can  be  defined  by  their  geographic  location  or  product  usage  levels.  A
               description of the individuals in the sample is called the participant profile.

                       The method used to choose the individuals that will be included in a sample will differ
               depending on what type of research methodology will be used. Probability sampling is used
               to  randomly  select  the  people  in  a  sample.  Nonprobability  sampling  is  utilized  when  the

               judgment of a researcher is used to make the selection.
                       The population being studied could be current customers who frequently purchase a
               product with the purpose of determining how a company can improve that product’s design.

               Past customers could be included in the sample to find sources of consumer dissatisfaction
               or to determine what other competing products they also purchase. Rather than current or
               past customers, potential market segments of interest to that company can also be studied.]]></page><page Index="261"><![CDATA[9


               For example, research can be conducted to determine what type of promotion might motivate
               older  consumers  to  purchase.  Another  purpose  of  researching  a  sample  of  potential

               consumers  is  to  determine  how  a  product  needs  to  be  adapted  to  offer  the  features  and
               benefits they desire. For example, a company that produces camping equipment might include
               in their sample individuals who are interested in extreme sports in order to learn how to adapt

               their product to meet these consumers’ preferences.
               Choose the Research Approach

                       The next step is to choose a research approach. The process of conducting primary
               research starts with deciding whether the research question calls for descriptive, exploratory
               or causal research. The choice will depend on whether or not a research question needs to

               be answered with quantifiable facts. If a research question asks ‘How many?’ or ‘Which one?’,
               descriptive or causal research will probably be used. If a research question asks the question

               ‘Why?’, then exploratory research will probably be used.
                       Understanding  how  an  organization  plans  to  use  the  information  will  also  help  in
               making  an  appropriate  decision.  If  an  organization  wishes  to  prove  a  fact  about  the

               demographic composition of its customers, such as how many females as compared to males
               purchase a product, then a descriptive study would be appropriate. If, on the other hand, an
               organization  wishes  to  discover  why  sales  are  falling,  it  will  need  to  conduct  exploratory

               research. Causal research will help determine the effect of a proposed change.
               Planning the Research Method
                       After choosing the research approach, researchers must design the research method.

               This will include the details of how the research will be conducted, including when, where and
               by  whom.  The  available  research  methods  will  include  surveys,  focus  groups,  interviews,

               projective techniques, observation, ethnography and grounded theory. A research plan will
               include the timeline for the research, the people needed and the budget.
                       For example, this step may involve writing survey questions or the script to be used in

               a focus group. The more detailed the planning, the more smoothly the research will proceed.
               Therefore everything, from the layout of the survey form to who will be responsible for ensuring

               that the focus group participants arrive, should be considered.
               Conducting the Research and Reporting Findings and Recommendations
                       Finally, researchers will be ready to conduct the research. Once done, the final task is

               for researchers to analyze the data and report the findings and conclusions. Analysis requires
               repeatedly  going  over  the  collected  responses  to  find  common  themes,  patterns  and
               connections. Reporting may be in the form of a written report, a verbal presentation, or both.

               A written report presenting the results of a quantitative research study will usually have an
               introduction followed  by  a  description  of the methodology. It  will  also  have  a  section  with
               findings supported with statistics and charts.]]></page><page Index="262"><![CDATA[10


                       These  findings  will  be  the  basis  of  the  recommendations  given  in  the  report.  With
               quantitative research, someone who has not conducted the research can still write the report

               based on the findings.
                       A report for a qualitative research study will follow the same outline. However, because
               there are no statistics or charts different types of visuals will be used to help clients understand

               the findings. Some tools that can be used include diagrams, quotes, photos and even videos.
               With qualitative research, the person who conducted the research must be involved in the

               writing of the report.




                                                 Research Approaches

                       One of the questions that an organization must decide before conducting research is
               which research approach will be most appropriate. The approach chosen will depend on the

               research question and the type of information a company is seeking.
                       As noted earlier, there are three general research approaches: descriptive, exploratory
               and causal. Each can be considered as being similar to a different type of tool box. Each

               approach “box” contains certain tools or methods that are most useful with that approach. After
               deciding the research approach, the company will choose the best method.
                       For example, if a car needs repair a person will open the automotive tool box and

               perhaps select a wrench. If a house needs repair, a carpentry tool box will be opened and a
               hammer may be selected as the needed tool. Each tool box will have a choice of tools that will
               be needed for a specific type of job. However, the first step is choosing the right tool box, not

               the specific tool (see Table 2.1).

               Descriptive Research
                       A company will perform descriptive research when it needs to obtain specific details
               on its consumers and their purchasing behavior. Descriptive research is used when statistical

               data are needed on a fact. The tool used to conduct descriptive research is almost always
               surveys. The advantage of a survey is that, if the number of people surveyed (the sample) is]]></page><page Index="263"><![CDATA[11


               large  enough,  it  can  be  said that  a fact  has  been  proved  and  is true  of the  entire  group.
               Descriptive survey data can give answers such as ‘37 percent of our customers are over the

               age of 55’ or ‘52 percent of our customers purchase four times a year’. If the number of people
               asked to complete the survey is large enough compared to the total population under study,
               the answer can even be said to have been proven.

                       Conducting descriptive research can be expensive and time consuming. However, it
               is necessary if a company wants to prove a guess or hypothesis about consumers or their

               behavior. For example, a descriptive study can be designed to prove that ‘10 percent of all
               current  consumers  will  purchase  the  more  expensive  new  product  model’.  This  guess  or
               hypothesis can be proved within a certain level of confidence that the answer obtained from

               the descriptive survey sample is true of the entire population.
                       However, descriptive research can also be used to obtain details without relying on

               statistical  proof.  Descriptive  research  is  sometimes  used  to  address  issues  that  are  just
               beginning to be explored, such as consumer preferences. Many organizations have relied
               heavily on surveys as their only means of market research. This is unfortunate as the type of

               information  that  surveys  can  provide  is  limited.  Yet  another  reason  for  rethinking  this
               dependence on descriptive surveys is that it is increasingly difficult to find a sufficient number
               of people who are willing to respond. Because people are often pressed for time, and also

               because of privacy issues, it is difficult to motivate people to respond to a survey. In an effort
               to make participation in a survey more convenient, email and social media are increasingly
               being used.

               Exploratory Research
                       Companies  should  use  exploratory  research  when  a  research  question  deals  with

               finding information on consumer attitudes, opinions and beliefs. Such exploratory research
               can be useful even when there is no specific problem to investigate. For example, a company
               might use exploratory research to look for marketing opportunities by researching trends or

               changes  in  consumer  behavior.  The  research  methods  available  to  conduct  exploratory
               studies include focus groups, interviews, projective techniques, observation, ethnography and

               grounded theory.
                       All  of  these  methods  use  a  qualitative  research  approach.  Exploratory  research  is
               designed to let participants provide their own answers. The research question, rather than

               asking for facts, focuses on a consumer’s needs, desires, preferences and values. Because
               so many different answers will result, statistically provable answers cannot be generated, but
               exploratory qualitative studies, if designed with considerable thought as to what information is

               wanted and how it is to be obtained, can provide invaluable information to a company. Such
               a study may be large and complex or it can be conducted on a small scale. Either way, the]]></page><page Index="264"><![CDATA[12


               consumer information received will provide details and insights that will help an organization
               adapt its product, price, promotion and distribution to meet consumer desires.

                       When using exploratory research tools, the emphasis is not on the size of a sample.
               Instead  it  is  on  choosing  the  correct  participants  and  the  analysis  of  the  information  they
               provide. For example, if asked why they purchase a company’s product, even if each individual

               has a unique answer, common themes will almost always appear. A researcher will analyze
               the responses and then group them by these common themes. One advantage of qualitative

               research is that it can also be approached in low-cost ways that are available to even small
               businesses.
               Causal Research

                       If a company wants to study the effect a change in its product will have on consumer
               purchasing  or  the  possible  success  of  a  new  promotional  campaign,  it should  use  causal

               research.  Causal  research  is  conducted  to  discover  whether  the  change  a  company  is
               planning to make will have a positive or negative effect on consumers.
                       Research  questions  that  require  causal  research  have  a  cause  and  effect  –  for

               example,  such  questions  as  ‘Will  a  new  promotion  campaign  using  a  celebrity  increase
               purchases of books among young people?’ or ‘Will customers at the cinema purchase more
               refreshments if we have a new menu?’ These issues can also be explored using experimental

               research. Even the effect of intangible factors on sales, such as smell and sound, can be
               researched.


                       If the change has already happened, internal quantitative data might already exist to
               answer the question. For example, if a company wants to know whether their new menu has
               increased sales, it can look at the sales figures. However, this is an expensive way to learn

               whether  a  new  menu  has  proved  successful.  A  better  use  of  research  would  be  to  use
               qualitative research tools before implementing the change. For example, experimenting by
               trying the new menu on a small scale first, to see whether customer reaction will be positive

               or negative. Such experiments should be carefully designed using the proper subjects and an
               impartial research design so that the results will be accurate.






                                                   Research Methods

                       Once  the  general  approach  is  understood,  the  next  step  will  involve  choosing  a
               research method and then planning the research. Marketing research methods can be divided

               into two different types – quantitative and qualitative. For a small study, research methods of
               only one type might be used. However, for some large-scale studies both types of research]]></page><page Index="265"><![CDATA[13


               may be needed. Quantitative research uses mathematical analysis to provide proof of a fact
               or a hypothesis (guess or assumption). When properly implemented, quantitative research

               can answer questions such as ‘How many consumers prefer our new product?’ or ‘Which of
               these three packaging designs is most attractive to consumers?’
                       The standard tool used when conducting quantitative research is the survey. Survey

               questions  give  participants  a  selected  number  of  responses  such  as  yes/no  or
               frequently/sometimes/never.  The  responses  are  then  entered  into  a  computer  using  a

               statistical  software  package.  The  software  will  tabulate  if  there  are  enough  responses  to
               support a ‘proved’ fact. This proved fact is then said to be true of the group of consumers as
               a whole (population) even though only a selected number (sample) were asked. Of course, it

               is impossible to ask all consumers. Therefore, it is necessary to determine how many people
               should participate in the quantitative survey to support this proof. To determine the correct

               number, researchers use their knowledge of sampling and statistics to construct a sample that
               contains the required number and type of participants.
                       This proof of consumer behavior is important when a company is planning a major

               expenditure, such as the introduction of a new product or a new promotional campaign. While
               quantitative studies can be expensive, because they must be conducted with a large enough
               sample, in some situations they are worth the cost. The cost is acceptable because if the

               wrong decision is made, even more money could be lost.
               Quantitative vs. Qualitative Research
                       Quantitative research is defined as research involving the administration of a set of

               structured questions with predetermined response options to a large number of respondents.
               Qualitative research involves collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data by observing what

               people do and say.
                       While quantitative studies are useful for answering questions such as ‘How many?’
               and ‘What?’, they are not as useful when answering questions such as ‘Why?’ or ‘What if?’ A

               qualitative study is designed to uncover consumer attitudes, beliefs and opinions rather than
               facts. Because it is difficult to know consumer preferences before the study is conducted, a

               quantitative survey form with predetermined answers can result in misleading results. Instead,
               a wider variety of qualitative research tools, including interviews, focus groups, observation
               and projective techniques, is available. These tools, when used by trained researchers, allow

               participants to fully express their opinions and beliefs.
                       Qualitative research uses fewer participants, who are not necessarily representative
               of all consumers in the population; sometimes they are chosen because they belong to a

               distinct  segment,  such  as  older  or  ethnic  consumers.  The  data  that  result  from  using  a
               qualitative approach are not in the form of statistics but rather in ideas and quotes expressed
               by participants and researchers’ notes. Interpretation of the data requires special skills, but]]></page><page Index="266"><![CDATA[14


               correctly analyzed qualitative data can provide a rich source of information for marketing ideas
               including new concepts for segmentation. Social media content can now be used as a data

               source for consumer research. The interpretation of these data requires special skills.

                                 Chapter III


                                      Determining the Research Question

                                                                   Week 4 – September 28 – October 2, 2020

                            “The aim of marketing is to know and understand the customer so well,
                                      the product or service sells itself.” – Peter Drucker

               Chapter Learning Outcomes
               By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

                       1.  identify a research problem; and
                       2.  formulate research questions.



                                          Defining Market Research Problems
                       Every research project should have a defined and explicit objective which clearly states

               why  the  research  is  being  carried  out.  All  other  aspects  of  planning  and  carrying  out  the
               research flow from this objective; in other words, if they do not contribute towards achieving
               this objective they almost certainly should not be undertaken. The objective should relate to

               the marketing decision which will have to be made or the problem that needs a solution (and
               decision).

                       Three questions determine if the research needs to take place:
                        •   What research exists already?
                        •   What research is needed?

                        •   Can the research readily be undertaken?
                       The objectives of research can range from helping a company improve its satisfaction

               rating amongst customers, to finding new markets for its products through to helping with the
               launch of new products. Let’s take an example of a company that is suffering with stagnant
               sales. The objective of the research is to find out the cause of the stagnant sales and how to

               get them moving upwards.
                       Where  the  starting  point  for  the  research  is  a  problem  (or  potential
               problem/opportunity) rather than a clear-cut decision to be made, an effective approach is to

               think of and list as many objectives as possible for the research. The researcher may make a
               specific contribution to this process based on the results of previous research in related areas.
                       Possible reasons for the company’s stagnant sales could be:

                          1.  The market is declining.
                          2.  The prices of the company’s products are too high relative to the competition.

                          3.  The benefits that the company is offering in terms of its products and services
                              relative to the competition are too low.]]></page><page Index="268"><![CDATA[16


                          4.  The  company  is  losing  customers  because  of  a  failure  in  its  products  or
                              services.

                          5.  The people who are buying the company’s products are old and retiring. New
                              buyers do not know of the company.
                          6.  The company’s image is tired and old fashioned.

                          7.  The company’s sales force is not active.
                       With only a little effort, the list of hypotheses generated is likely to be quite extensive

               and probably more than can be sensibly covered in any one research project. This would
               mean that some selection will have to be made of the hypotheses which are to be covered in
               the research project. This is likely to be based on a judgement of which is the more likely

               explanation  of  the  problem;  evidence  that  is  already  available  –  including  from  previous
               research  as  well  as  from  more  informal  sources  –  may  enable  some  hypotheses  to  be

               confidently discounted. For example, in the above listing, if there haven’t been any complaints,
               it could reasonably be assumed that hypothesis number 4 is not valid. However, the sales
               force could be constantly reporting that the prices are too high against the benefits that are

               being offered. This could point to the hypotheses which do seem worth researching and will
               be the basis of a valid research objective.
                       To write out clear objectives you need information about the background of a problem.

               What really lies at the root of the problem? What is the background to the market, or to the
               issue? and What factors led to the current problem?
                       A  useful  framework  for  identifying  the  links  between  a  problem  and  a  research

               objective is shown in Figure 3.1. Write down a high-level question that you think you would
               like to answer. Then think through all the factors that could be causing this question to arise.

               Finally, think through all the information that you need to fully understand about the problem
               and the level of knowledge that you hold on the subject.]]></page><page Index="269"><![CDATA[17

                                          Determining the Research Question
                       Writing a research question that clearly states the problem to be researched takes
               considerable  thought.  Since  this  question  is  the  rationale  for  the  all  research  that  will  be

               conducted, it is well worth the effort to make sure that this question is focused on the correct
               problem.  In  addition,  a  research  question  will  need  to  address  what  current  or  potential

               consumers  will  need to be  asked to  learn  more  about  a  problem.  A  well  written  research
               question  will  make  planning  the  remainder  of  the  research  study  much  easier.  Table  3.1
               provides examples of the relationship between type of organization, specific problems and the

               resulting research questions and Table 3.2 provides detailed questions that can be answered
               by market research.]]></page><page Index="270"><![CDATA[18

               Purpose of the Research Question
                       Good research starts with data, which are turned into information to provide companies

               with the knowledge they need to solve problems. Researchers must always remember that
               research is conducted for the purpose of solving a company’s problems. For research to be]]></page><page Index="271"><![CDATA[19


               useful,  researchers  must  have  an  understanding  of  company’s  needs,  and  not  just  a
               knowledge of research methodology.

                       To provide the necessary information it is important to have the right research question
               stated correctly. The research question may be stated in either an interrogative or declarative
               style. An interrogative research question identifies the information needed in question form:

               for example, “What type of media is the best means to communicate promotions to college
               age males?” A declarative research question identifies the information needed as a statement:

               for  example,  “The  purpose  of  this  research  is  to  determine  the  best  media  to  use  when
               communicating promotions to college age males.” Either form can be used as the start of a
               research proposal.

               Writing the Research Question
                       For both quantitative and qualitative studies, the question itself needs to be as narrowly

               defined as possible. To do so, researchers must define who, where, what, when and how as
               will be used in the question (shown in Table 3.3 below).

               Table 3.3 Defining the research question
                Who?         Describe the participants who will take part in the research by demographic, psychographic
                             and usage characteristics
                Where?       The geographic location of current or potential consumers or the area of product sales
                When?        The time frame of the behavior under study
                What?        A specific description of the product
                Why?         The attitude or motivation of concern to researchers
                How?         The proposed actions that could be undertaken by the company

                       This  includes  whose  behavior  is  of  concern  to  the  researchers.  For  example,  the
               question as to why young consumers are purchasing fewer soft drinks could be improved by
               defining what age group is meant by “young” consumers. They also must decide if they want

               this information on all young consumers or only those from a certain income level.
                       Researchers should also be concerned about where the behavior under study is taking

               place. For example, they must decide if they mean all young consumers nationally or only
               those living in urban areas. The geographic area might also be defined by where the product
               is sold. In the case of company expansion, the area might also be where a product will be sold

               in the future.
                       Researchers must also establish the time frame for the behavior that is being studied.
               For example, the research question might ask about changes in behavior in the last month,

               year  or  longer. In  addition, researchers must  define  what  products they  are  studying.  For
               example, are they interested in sales of all of a company’s soft drink products, or only a certain
               brand, package style or size? The question could be rephrased as, “Why are sales of our fruit

               flavored soft drinks declining among young, single females, aged 18–24, living in metropolitan]]></page><page Index="272"><![CDATA[20


               areas, and who are financially independent from their families?” The question could be further
               improved by more clearly defining the “Why?” in the above question. It could be clearly stated

               as “due to increased concern about healthy eating”. Of course, this may not be possible if the
               researchers have not been able to come to this conclusion before the start of the research
               process.

                       The question of “How can we regain our market share of young soft drink consumers?’
               also needs to be stated more specifically because there can be so many possible means to

               regain market share. The means could include price decreases, packaging changes, product
               enhancements or new promotional campaigns. Most companies will not have the resources
               to plan and conduct primary research to answer all of these questions. The final decision on

               which question to research will be based on analyzing the benefits of the research versus the
               cost. After considering these factors, the final question could be restated as “What type of

               promotional message will motivate purchase of our fruit flavored soft drink by health-conscious
               females, aged 14–18, living at home in suburban areas, over the next year?” Sometimes who
               should be the focus of the question will change over time.

                       There  are  general  rules  that  should  be  remembered  when  a  research  question  is
               written. First, the question should be an assertion of fact on which the researcher takes a side.
               It should not be stated in vague terms such as “The reason for declining sales may be a lack

               of promotion.” The purpose of the research will be to determine if it is, or if it isn’t. Therefore,
               the researcher must decide which way to state the question – but it can’t be both ways.
                       In addition, the researcher must state the question so that it argues only one point of

               fact. The question “Are sales declining because of a lack of promotion or because of increased
               competition?”  is  actually  two  research  questions.  Different  methodologies  and  different

               research participants may be needed for each. Thus, if the researcher tries to combine them,
               the research may answer neither question.
                       Lastly, a research question must pass the “So what?” test. Does the question generate

               enough  interest  from  management  that  they  will  be  willing  to  approve  the  research?  The
               answer  must  lead  to  a  recommendation  that  will  either  significantly  increase  revenue  or

               decrease expenses, or it will not be approved.
                       Research questions can be developed for any component of the marketing mix and,
               also, the target market segment and consumer behavior. Table 3.4 below provides examples

               of research questions that could be asked for each component of the marketing mix.]]></page><page Index="273"><![CDATA[21

               Chapter Learning Outcomes
               By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

                   1.  explain the components of a research report;
                   2.  properly cite author(s), indirect sources, and electronic sources; and
                   3.  define secondary data, their benefits, uses, sources and process.




                                             Content of a Research Report
                       Research  reports  are  detailed  and  accurate  accounts  of the  conduct  of  disciplined

               studies accomplished to solve problems or to reveal new knowledge. Accurate and thorough
               information is the foundation of all successful business ventures because it provides a wealth

               of information about prospective and existing customers, the competition, and the industry in
               general. It allows business owners to determine the feasibility of a business before committing
               substantial resources to the venture.

                       Market  research  provides  relevant  data  to  help  solve  marketing  challenges  that  a
               business  will  most  likely  face  an  integral  part  of  the  business  planning  process.  In  fact,

               strategies  such  as  market  segmentation  (identifying  specific  groups  within  a  market)  and
               product differentiation (creating an identity for a product or service that separates it from those
               of the competitors) are impossible to develop without market research.]]></page><page Index="275"><![CDATA[23

                   Executive summary
                   The executive summary is a “skeleton” of your report. It serves as a summary for the busy

               executive or a preview for the in-depth reader. It provides an overview of the most useful
               information, including the conclusions and recommendations. The executive summary should
               be very carefully written, conveying the information as concisely as possible. It should briefly

               cover the general subject of the research, the scope of the research (what the research covers/
               does not cover), identification of the methods used (i.e., a mail survey of 1,000 homeowners),

               conclusions, and recommendations.
               Background of the Study
                       This section should outline the background to the market research problem that the

               students  are  seeking  to  solve.  Include  background  information  on  the  market  to  provide
               context, as well as circumstances that have led to the need for such research. Background

               should be limited to 200 words at most, with most of the word count dedicated to the market
               circumstances and challenges surrounding the research.
               Research Objectives

                       In this section, the  researchers  will  identify  the research  objectives  of  their market
               research topic. The researchers should observe the following guidelines in presenting the

                          success;
                       2.  Ensure each objective is SMART: specific, measurable, achievable, relevant and

                          time-bound;
                       3.  Keep objectives simple and within the remit of the specific research project which

                          is being outlined. Should be written in future tense;
                       4.  focus on the decisions/ initiatives that the research will inform rather than results;
                          and

                       5.  Refrain from listing expected outcomes or hypotheses.
               Research Method

                       The  method  describes,  in  as  much  detail  as  necessary,  how  you  conducted  the
               research, who (or what) your subjects were, and what tools or methods were used to achieve
               your  objectives.  In  most  cases,  the  method  section  does  not  need  to  be  long.  It  should,

               however, provide the essential information your reader needs to understand how the data
               were collected and how the results were achieved. It should be detailed enough that the data
               collection could be replicated by others for purposes of reliability. In other words, the method

               section should be clear enough that other researchers could conduct a similar study.]]></page><page Index="277"><![CDATA[25


                       Sample plan
                       This section includes the description of the sample that the students wish to research.

               The descriptions should draw on behavioral, psychographics, geographic, and demographic
               factors.
                       The sample plan should be used to indicate the number of participants they wish to

               research as well as the breakdown of each group. This will be affected by the choice to use
               qualitative, quantitative or multi-method approaches, as well as the estimated size of the target

               population.
                       Data collection
                       This section should contain listing of different parameters or information that will be

               gathered including techniques, instrument or mathematical formula/equation needed to get
               the correct data to be used in the research.

               Key Findings

                     The results section is the most important portion of your report. Some researchers prefer

               to use the term findings. This section should logically present the findings of your research

               and may be organized around the research objectives for the study. The results should be

               presented in narrative form and accompanied by tables, charts, figures, and other appropriate

               visuals that support and enhance the explanation of results. Tables and figures are supportive

               material; they should not be overused or used as filler. Each should contain a number and title


               and should be referred to in the narrative. Outline your results section before you write the

               report. The survey questionnaire itself can serve as a useful aid in organizing your results

               because the questions are often grouped in a logical order or in purposeful sections. Another

               useful method  for  organizing  your results  is  to  individually  print  all  tables  and figures  and

               arrange them in a logical sequence. Once you have the results outlined properly, you are


               ready to write the introductory sentences, definitions (if necessary), review of the findings

               (often referring to tables and figures), and transition sentences to lead into the next topic.

               Conclusion and Recommendation

                   Conclusions  and  recommendations  may  be  listed  together  or  in  separate  sections,

               depending on the amount of material you have to report. In any case, you should note that

               conclusions  are  not  the  same  as  recommendations.  Conclusions  are  the  outcomes  and

               decisions you have reached based on your research results. For example, if the data show]]></page><page Index="278"><![CDATA[26


               the order of preference for five car models, a conclusion would be: “Model C had the highest

               preference.” Recommendations are suggestions for how to proceed based on the conclusions.

               For  example,  “The  company  should  produce  and  market  Model  C.”  Unlike  conclusions,

               recommendations  may  require  knowledge  beyond  the  scope  of  the  research  findings

                                          Research Report Technical Details

                       In order to ensure uniformity, all market research manuscripts will adopt the following
               formats:
               Paper and Printing

                       Manuscripts, documents and papers will be computer-generated and compiled in white
               bond paper, A4 size (21 cm x 29.7 cm).

               Font Style and Size
                       Arial font style and size 11 will be used in all manuscripts, documents and papers.
               Smaller than font size 11 may be used in tables with several entries.

               Margin and Spacing
                       The left margin of each of the manuscripts should be used 1.5 inches (3.81 cm), while

               top,  bottom  and right margins  should  be  1  inch  (2.54  cm)  each.  Kindly  see figure  5.3 for
               example.































                                               Figure 5.3. Illustration of margins.

                       Paragraph  indention  should  be  five  spaces  (one  tab)  from  the  left  margin.  Within
               chapter headings and the paragraph that follows, three single spaces will be observed. The
               majority of them have to be double spaced. For a guide, look at the figure below.]]></page><page Index="280"><![CDATA[28




















                                                 Figure 5.4. Illustration of line spacing

               Page Numbers
                       The page number is displayed at the top right corner of the paper. The first page of

               every chapter is supposed to have imaginary page numbers.
               Tables

                       The title of the tables will provide a concise overview of table entries. Table titles adopt
               the capitalization of the sentence. Using a single space between the title of table and the table
               itself. For long table titles, the succeeding lines should be in hanging indention.

                       In tables containing several levels of headings, the first level is in ALL CAPS, while the
               second and following levels will be upper- and lower-case fonts.

                       Units of quantity will be enclosed in parentheses directly after the column heading.
               Table entries should be organized in rows and columns either single or two spaces.
                       Tables must be inserted inside the text or on a different page immediately after they've

               been introduced; should be numbered consecutively Arabic numerals. Use 1 point line for all
               horizontal lines, there should be no vertical lines; 1.5 spaces between entries.
                       Tables need not be separated as frequently as possible. When the tables are split into

               individual pages, the next half of the tables will be entitled (see Figure 5.5).]]></page><page Index="281"><![CDATA[29

















                                                   Figure 5.5 Sample table


               Figures
                       Figures may appear in the form of pictures, drawings, diagrams, portraits, blue prints,
               maps, graphs and charts.  Figures should be quick and easy enough to be interpreted without

               reading the captions.
                       Figures  should  be  printed  directly  in  the  document  and  not  glued  or  pasted.   The

               captions will be positioned under the bottom of the figure between two single spaces  and
               centered within the figure. If the figure is taken from references, the source should be cited in
               the parenthesis after the captions.

               Number, Figures and Symbols
                       As a basic guideline, spell out figures from one to nine. Ten and above should be

               actually written as numbers.
                       Examples:
                                  1-9        Three sari-sari stores         Nine stores
                             10 and above    20 female participants      10 luxury brands


                       Note: Avoid beginning a sentence with a figure. If really need to do so, the number
               should be written out (for example: fourteen respondents were . . . .)
                       Reminders:

                       Number are spelled out if you used cardinals (e.g. fourth, fifth), used fractions (e.g.
               three fourth), used to express indefinite and approximate period of time (e.g. one hundred

               years ago). Don’t use the symbol “%” instead, spell out the word “percent” in the text. You can
               only use the symbol “%” when enclosed in parenthesis or in tabulations.
                       You will use the numbers in the paragraph as long as it is expression of time (e.g. 4:00

               a.m.), telephone number, amount of money, plate numbers and age.]]></page><page Index="282"><![CDATA[30


               Abbreviations
                       As a general guideline, parenthesis acronyms and abbreviated terms can only appear

               on their very first reference in the paragraph.
               Spelling
                       The  revised  edition  of  the  Standard  English  dictionary  will  be  checked  in  order  to

               evaluate the appropriate spelling of words. The spelling should be consistent in the text.
               Tenses

                       The  present  tense  is  usually  used  to  express  hypotheses,  philosophies,
               generalizations and assumptions. The present tense is often used to describe the effects of
               the results of the study. The past tense is used to explain the outcome of the analysis.

               References
                       Below is the example of how references look like in the actual paper.

                                           Conducting Secondary Research

                     Primary research is initial research conducted by you (or someone you hire) to gather
               data  directly  for  your  current  objective.  You  may  be  conducting  a  survey,  conducting  an
               interview or a focus group, observing behavior, or conducting an experiment. You should be

               the  one  who  actually  obtains  this  raw  data  that  will  be  obtained  primarily  for  the  current
               research  needs.  Secondary  research,  on  the  other  side,  involves searching for  existing
               data that  was  originally  obtained  by  someone  else.  You  may  want  to  search  in  papers,

               archives, or go to web sites like the census. You will apply what you find to your current
               assessment in your research problem, but the data you find was not initially gathered by you,
               nor was it obtained for the purpose you are using it for.

                   Examples of secondary research are:
                       •  Journal articles
                       •  textbooks
                       •  dictionaries and encyclopedias
                       •  dissertations]]></page><page Index="283"><![CDATA[31


                       •  newspaper editorial/opinion pieces
                       •  criticism of literature, art works or music
                       •  Magazine articles

                       Secondary research for existing data is always the first choice for researchers as it
               saves time and money. However, secondary data should only be used if the data are relevant

               and relate appropriately to the problem. The data should also be credible, timely, accurate and
               affordable. Ensuring the usability of secondary data is the responsibility of researchers. Data
               used by the researcher should not only deal with the consumer market segment or the product

               category, they must be relevant by specifically addressing what researchers need to know.
               With vast amounts of information available online, it is relatively easy to find data. However,

               researchers must take the time and effort to verify the credibility of sources of data to ensure
               these come from reputable organizations or publications. If the source is a website it can be
               more  difficult  to  determine  creditability.  Researchers  must  verify  which  individual  or

               organization is responsible for the content of a website. Besides the relevance and credibility
               of a source, researchers should determine the date when a study was published, as the data
               should be timely. What is considered outdated depends on the product or consumer groups

               being studied. Fashion and technology information becomes dated very quickly. In other fields,
               the opposite is true.

                       When evaluating the accuracy of data, a researcher should ascertain who it was who
               originally  collected  the  data  included  in  a  study.  It  is  not  necessary  to  know  researchers
               personally, but it is necessary to know that the specific organization for which researchers

               collected the data is reputable. How the data were collected should also be examined. Data
               that have been collected using the wrong method or a flawed sample will result in erroneous
               results. Finally, the cost of the data should be considered. Even the best data cannot be used

               if they cannot be afforded.
               Uses of Secondary Data

                       There are so many uses of secondary data that it is rare for a marketing research
               project to be conducted without including some of this information. Some projects may be

               based  exclusively  on  secondary  data.  The  applications  of  secondary  data  range  from
               predicting broad changes in a culture’s “way of life” to specific applications, such as selecting

               a street address location for a new car wash. Decision Analyst, Inc., a marketing research
               firm,  has  a  Web  site  entirely  devoted  to  secondary  data.  Suggested  applications  include
               economic-trend  forecasting,  corporate  intelligence,  international  data,  public  opinion,  and

               historical data, among others. Marketers are interested in knowing secondary data in terms of
               demographic data to help them forecast the size of the market in a newly proposed market
               territory. A researcher may use secondary data to determine the population and growth rate

               in almost any geographical area. Government agencies are interested in knowing secondary]]></page><page Index="284"><![CDATA[32


               data to guide public policy decisions. The Department of Education needs to know how many
               five-year-old will enter the public-school system each year. Health care planners need to know

               how many senior citizens will be eligible for Medicare during the next decade.
                       Sometimes  secondary  data  can  be  used  to  evaluate  market  performance.  For
               example, since gasoline and fuel taxes collected per gallon are available in public records,

               petroleum marketers can easily determine the volume of fuels consumed in a country, thus
               making market share calculations easy and reliable. Articles are written on virtually every topic,

               and this storehouse of secondary data is available to marketers who want to understand a
               topic more thoroughly even though they themselves may not have firsthand experience. A
               wealth  of  secondary  data  is  available  concerning  the  lifestyles  and  purchasing  habits  of

               demographic groups. Since the people in these demographic groups tend to make similar
               purchases and have similar attitudes, they have been scrutinized by marketers.

                   Choosing Participants using Segmentation Characteristics to Develop a Profile
                        Consumers  are  at  the  heart  of  the  marketing  concept  and the marketing  mix  of
                 product,  price,  place  and  promotion  is  designed  to  attract  a  specific  market  segment.

                 Therefore,  it  is  not  surprising  that  participants  for  research  studies  are often  chosen  to
                 match  the  characteristics  of  a  company’s  current  or  potential  target market segment  of

                 consumers. Of course the company will want to know more about what this segment of
                 current or potential customers feels about issues such as their marketing mix for current
                 products or about new product ideas.

                        One  method  to  begin  the  process  of  developing  the  participant  profile  for  a
                 qualitative research study is to start with segmentation characteristics. The main bases for

                 segmentation  are  demographic,  psychographic,  usage  and  geographic.  The  research
                 question will provide information as to who should be included in the research sample.

                 Choosing participants based on Demographics
                        Probably the easiest place to start developing the participant profile would be to

                 define the potential research study sample participants by demographics.
                        Products that are specifically designed for one gender may require a group that
                 consists of men only. For example, a company might wish to expand their skin lotion product

                 line with a product designed specifically for men. However, even if the product is for men,
                 if  potential  purchasers  will  include  women  they  may  also  need  to  be  included  in  the

                 participant profile. The age of potential research participants also needs to be considered.
                 Once again, this may be determined by the research question. If it specifically asks about
                 the opinions and attitudes of younger or older consumers, then those participants must be

                 chosen with their age in mind. Likewise groups should be composed of participants from
                 the relevant income, education and ethnicity groups specified by research question.

                        If a research study does not specify that a certain gender, age, education, income
                 or  ethnicity  is  relevant,  participants  should  be  chosen  to  represent  as  many  of  these
                 characteristics  as  possible.  Researchers  might  learn  (when  analyzing  the  data)  what

                 demographic characteristics are actually relevant to the research question.
                 Psychographic Characteristics

                        Psychographic characteristics, on the other hand, are not so easy to determine.
                 However,  they  may  be  even  more  important  in  choosing  research  participants  than

                 demographics.  Psychographic  characteristics  focus  on  a  consumer’s  lifestyle,  including
                 their  opinions,  interests  and  attitudes.  These  are  more  often  the  characteristics  that

                 influence consumer purchases than demographic factors. A consumer lifestyle, such as an
                 interest in extreme sports, may still predominately attract a specific demographic group
                 such as young males.

                        Marketers  know  that  it  is  lifestyle  that  often  influences  the  choice  of  a  product.
                 Therefore, a participant profile for qualitative research is often chosen based on lifestyle

                 choice. In fact, the trend now is to segment even more finely.
                 Geographic Characteristics

                        Researchers  may  consider  geographic  location  when  developing  a  participant
                 profile based on product availability. If the product to be researched is only available in

                 specific geographic locations, then the research subjects must also come from these areas.
                 For  example,  if  researchers  are  conducting  a  study  on  consumer  motivation  when
                 purchasing  a  locally  brewed  beer,  the  potential  research  participants  will  need  to  be

                 recruited from the area where that beer is sold. To motivate potential research subjects to
                 participate in the research, they will need to perceive the location as being convenient.]]></page><page Index="287"><![CDATA[35


                 Therefore the distance a potential participant might be willing to travel would need to be
                 considered when developing the profile.

                 Usage Characteristics

                        Another aspect of usage to consider as part of a participant profile is product loyalty.
                 Sometimes researchers may describe the participant profile as consumers who are new,

                 lapsed  or  frequent  product  users.  These  characteristics  cannot  be  determined  without
                 occasional screening questions about the type of product usage. Therefore, the screening
                 questionnaire must ask if a potential participant is familiar with the product, their level of

                 usage and if they have used competing products.



                                       Probability and Non-Probability Sampling
                Probability Sampling

                        Probability sampling uses techniques that result in an ability to calculate exactly the
                probability  of  a  single  person  in  a  sampling  frame  being  chosen  to  participate.  This
                probability is based on the number of total people in that sample divided by the number of

                total people in the population. If the population is a known number this is quite easy to
                calculate. A survey that includes 250 people, out of a population of 1,000, means that every
                individual in the population has a 25 per cent probability of being included. The methods of

                conducting probability sampling include simple, stratified, systematic, and cluster. Of course
                for most research studies the total number of people who are in a population at any given

                moment  is  unknown.  Probability  sampling  can  still  be  conducted  with  the  probability
                calculated based on a reasonable estimate of the entire population.
                        The methods of probability sampling from which researchers can choose include

                simple,  stratified,  systemic  and  cluster.  These  vary  in  the  randomness  of  the  resulting
                sample. They also vary in their complexity and the time and effort it will take to construct a

                sample.
                    Simple random sampling
                        The most easily understood method is simple random sampling. In this method each

                sampling unit has an equal chance of being chosen to participate in the research study. The
                probability can be calculated by dividing the number of people in that sample by the total
                number of people in the population.

                                                    Total Number of Population (N)]]></page><page Index="288"><![CDATA[36


                    Systematic sampling
                        Even though it is a much simpler method to use, systematic sampling will result in a

                sample  that  is  almost  random.  In  systematic  sampling,  after  the  population  has  been
                determined,  all  units  in  the  population  are  listed  and  counted.  A  skip  interval  is  then
                calculated by dividing the total population by the sample size and this interval is used to

                choose who will be included in the sample. At first glance this may seem to be as random
                as simple sampling, but this is not so.

                        Calculating the skip interval…
                                                          Population Size (N)
                                            Skip Interval =
                                                            Sample Size (n)
                    Stratified sampling

                        Stratified  sampling  is  used  when  researchers  believe  that  answers  will  vary
                depending on the demographic, psychographic, geographic or usage characteristics of each
                person in a population. There are two main reasons for choosing a stratified sample. First

                of all the population may be skewed in such a way that it is difficult to obtain a random
                sample using either a random or systematic method. In this case, stratified sampling is used
                to  increase  the  randomness  of  the  sample.  Second,  the  research  study  may  call  for

                comparing results between specific groups within a population. The main reason for using
                stratified  sampling  is  to  ensure  that  any  differences  are  diminished  by  the  sampling

                procedure. Another reason is when the research study is designed to learn more about
                differences between groups. Most populations can be divided into smaller groups based on
                shared characteristics.

                        Using a stratified sample allows marketing researchers to examine each of the strata
                separately. Initially, researchers must decide how many participants will be chosen from the

                population as a whole. After that researchers must decide on how to distribute the number
                of total participants among the different strata.
                    Cluster sampling

                        Cluster sampling also divides populations into groups. However, cluster sampling
                differs by reason of why a population is divided and the number of resulting groups. In
                cluster sampling a population is divided into many groups. Rather than being different, the

                aim  of  the  resulting  groups  is  that  each  will  include  individuals  who  represent  the  total
                population.  The  purpose  of  cluster  sampling  is  to  economically  and  efficiently  obtain  a
                sample  from  a  large  population  that  provides  an  accurate  representation  of  an  entire

                population. Such a method could also be combined with other sampling methods to form
                subgroups.]]></page><page Index="289"><![CDATA[37


                Non-Probability Sampling
                        Non-probability sampling uses a technique where each potential subject does not

                have the same probability of being included. The sample size and the specific participants
                are  determined  regardless  of  the  total  population.  The  methods  of  conducting  non-
                probability sampling include convenience, judgment, snowball and quota.

                    Convenience sampling
                        Convenience sampling is used when researchers choose any willing and available

                individuals as participants. This method can be implemented when it is known that a specific
                location  tends  to  attract  the  type  of  individual  needed  for  that  research  study.  The
                recruitment of participants can then take place in this location as it is where people who

                meet the profile tend to congregate.
                    Snowballing

                        Another  method  of  choosing  participants  is  called  ‘snowball’  sampling.  With  this
                method  researchers  choose  the  first  participant  to  match  the  participant  profile.  This
                participant then refers others with similar characteristics. The theory for using this system is

                that  the  first  participant  is  more  likely  to  know  someone  like  themselves  than  the
                researchers. This method is appropriate when the research calls for participants who may
                be from psychographic or ethnic groups that are very different to those of the researchers.

                There are two reasons for using snowballing. Firstly, researchers may not have a knowledge
                of  the  relevant  participants.  Secondly,  even  if  they  did,  potential  participants  may  not
                respond to an invitation from the researchers to participate.

                    Quota sampling
                        A simpler and cheaper means of obtaining a representative sample is to set a quota

                for  the  interviewers  to  achieve  one  that  mirrors  that  of  the  population  that  is  being
                researched.  Filling  the  quota  will  provide  a  mix  of  respondents  that  is  reflective  of  the
                population that is being targeted. In effect the choice of respondents in a quota sample is

                left to interviewers (unlike the case with pre-selected random samples) providing they fill the
                quotas to ensure the overall sample is representative, in key parameters, of the population

                being researched.
                    Judgment or purposive sampling
                        The research question will define the characteristics of the participant profile. It is

                important that the participants chosen match this profile so that they have the necessary
                common experiences which will result in useful research data. If input is needed from more
                than  one  type  of  research  subject,  then  more  than  one  participant  profile  should  be

                developed and two groups of potential subjects will need to be recruited. The process of
                using purposive sampling first includes establishing the participant profile. Then a list of]]></page><page Index="290"><![CDATA[38


                potential  research  subjects  is  identified  that  have  the  needed  characteristics  and
                knowledge. Finally, specific individuals from this list are asked to participate. Researchers

                may sometimes need to find participants for more than one type of methodology: it is not
                uncommon for large companies to conduct more than one type of qualitative research at a
                time.

                                       In-Depth, Intercept and Expert Interviews
                 Type of Interviews

                        The  choice  of  marketing  research  interviewing  methodologies  includes  in-depth
                 interviews.  With  this  technique  a  researcher  spends  most  of  the  interview  exploring
                 consumer motivation and behavior. Expert interviews are used to gather information from

                 people who are not necessarily direct consumers of a specific product, but have knowledge
                 of either that product and industry or the needs and wants of the market segment that is

                 being targeted. Intercept interviews are short person-on-the-street interviews that only ask
                 a few predetermined questions. This information can be used to develop hypotheses that
                 can then be proved or disproved by using quantitative research.

                    •  In-depth: one-to-one on a single topic for an extended period
                    •  Expert: with a person other than the research subject to obtain facts

                    •  Intercept or person-on-the-street: short interviews with many participants
                        In-depth interviews
                        In-depth interviews are conducted between an interviewer and a single participant.

                 The interview is partially structured with some of the questions being predetermined. These
                 questions are written by researchers and based on the research question. A researcher will

                 ask other questions based on information provided by the participants during the interviews.
                 In-depth interviews usually last a little under an hour and go through four phases: opening,
                 questioning, probing and closing.]]></page><page Index="292"><![CDATA[40

                        Expert interviews
                        Expert  interviews  are  usually  conducted  early  on  in  the  research  process  as  a
                 means  of  clarifying  a  research  problem.  They  can  also  be  used  to  gather  data  during

                 research,  but  only  in  combination  with  other  research  methods.  An  expert  interview  is
                 conducted  to  gather  factual  information  about  a  problem  from  someone  with  a  specific
                 product,  consumer  or  industry  knowledge.  Because  this  expert  is  usually  a  busy

                 professional, the time for an interview is kept as short as possible. The expert interview
                 consists  of  only  two  phases  –  opening  and  questioning.  Because  the  purpose  of  the

                 interview is to gain factual information, and not the underlying causes of behavior, probing
                 is not used. This also allows for the interview to be conducted in a shorter time.

                        Intercept interviews
                        Person-on-the-street interviews also ask open-ended questions. In this case though
                 the interview is kept very short. An intercept interview should only take a few minutes and

                 is therefore limited to three or four questions. The participants are chosen and interviewed
                 at the location where they can be found. This technique is often used when the subjects

                 needed  for  the  research  are  unwilling  to  agree  to  an  in-depth  interview.  Because  the
                 interviews take a short period of time, many more can be conducted. However, the short
                 time  period  for  person-on-the-street  interviews  means  that  there  isn’t  time  for  probing

                 questions. Therefore interviewers used for this type of interview does not need the same
                 level of technical skill. Instead, it is more important that the potential participants view the

                 interviewer as someone who is friendly and approachable. Below is an example of how
                 intercept interviews are used in researching fashions trends.]]></page><page Index="293"><![CDATA[41

                              Projective, Observational and Ground Theory Techniques
                Projective Techniques

                        Projective  techniques  are  used  to  encourage  communication  using  nonverbal
                methods  of  response.  They  include  completion  tasks  and  other  techniques  such  as
                component  sorts  and  thematic  appreciation  tests.  These  techniques  elicit  information

                through  writing,  drawing  and  a  variety  of  ways  other  than  answering  verbally.  These
                techniques, borrowed from psychology, are gaining increased use in marketing. The aim of
                such projective techniques is to gain insights from participants of which they may not be

                totally aware
                    Types of projective techniques
                        There are many different projective techniques that researchers can use individually

                or in combination with other research methods. These are creative tools that are especially
                appealing to researchers working in nonprofit organizations and creative industries. The

                most  common  projective  techniques  are  completion  tasks,  such  as  word  associations,
                sentence and story completion, and cartoons. More advanced projective techniques include
                thematic appreciation and component sorts. Creative researchers may even develop their

                own  techniques.  Many  projective  techniques  involve  the  completion  of  a  task  that  a
                researcher has begun. Such techniques allow participants to describe an experience in their

                own words but without speaking. These tasks include sentence or story completion. If a
                researcher feels that participants will not find the tasks too challenging, they can also include
                advertisement  completion  and  product  design.  Even  more  creative  would  be  for  a
                researcher to ask participants to prepare the copy for an ad about a specific product that

                would motivate them to make that purchase. If the product under research is an experience,
                the participants might be asked to construct what they consider to be an ideal event or

                performance. Other projective techniques include the thematic appreciation test, which uses
                photos to elicit responses, and component sorts where words and ideas are placed on cards
                which participants are then asked to associate with products and segments. All of these

                tasks allow participants to provide information about products without using themselves as
                subjects, which in turn allows them to reveal information in a non-threatening manner.]]></page><page Index="294"><![CDATA[42

                Observational Research

                        Another  research  method  that  can  be  used  by  organizations  is  observation.
                Observational research is based on analyzing what people do rather than what they say.
                The research is conducted without communicating with people, but rather by noting their

                behavior. Observational research is being conducted in new ways as technology is now
                making it possible to ‘observe’ using the internet, scanner-tracking, video and neuroimaging
                    Types of observations

                        There are three distinct types of observational research. When using the complete
                observer approach, research subjects will not be aware they are under observation. Using

                another type of observational research, researchers will participate in the behavior at the
                same time as they are observing. A third approach is for researchers to completely immerse
                themselves in a behaviour.

                Grounded Theory
                        Most research starts with a theory of why people behave the way that they do. A
                research methodology is then designed to test whether this theory is correct. Grounded

                theory starts with the opposite approach. Rather than the researchers first establishing a
                theory and then observing the behavior to determine if they are correct, the researchers
                observe the behavior to determine a theory. Conducting grounded theory is useful when the

                consumer behavior to be studied involves social interaction.
                        Grounded theory, like ethnography, involves research that takes place in the ‘field’

                or where a specific consumer behavior is taking place. What is unique about grounded
                theory is that the analysis does not wait until after the research has been conducted. Instead,
                the analysis of the data takes place on an ongoing basis. As a result of this analysis, the

                next subject observation or interview question will be adjusted. Thus, theory is built from the
                ground up rather than imposed from above.]]></page><page Index="295"><![CDATA[43


                                                 Questionnaire Design
                Basic Concepts in Measurement

                        Measurement is determining a description or amount of some property of an object
                that  is  of  interest  to  the  researcher.  For  instance,  a  marketing  manager  may  want  to
                determine what brand a person typically purchases or how much of the product he or she

                uses in a certain time period. This information, once compiled, can help answer specific
                research objectives such as determining product opinions and usage.

                        But what are we really measuring? We are measuring properties— sometimes called
                characteristics,  attributes,  or  qualities—of  objects.  Objects  include  consumers,  brands,
                stores, advertisements, or whatever construct is of interest to the researcher working with a

                particular manager. Properties are the specific features or characteristics of an object that
                can be used to distinguish it from another object. For example, assume the object we want

                to research is a consumer. The properties of interest to a manager who is trying to define
                who buys a specific product are a combination of demographics, such as age and gender,
                as well as buyer behavior, which includes such things as the buyer’s preferred brand and

                perceptions  of  various  brands.  Once  the  object’s  designation  on  a  property  has  been
                determined, we say that the object has been measured on that property.
                        Measurement underlies marketing research to a great extent because researchers

                are keenly interested in describing marketing phenomena. Furthermore, researchers are
                often given the task of finding relevant differences in the profiles of various customer types,
                and measurement is a necessary first step in this task. Measurement is a simple process

                as  long  as  we  are  measuring  objective  properties,  which  are  physically  verifiable
                characteristics such as age, income, number of bottles purchased, store last visited, and so

                on. They are observable and tangible. Typically, objective properties such as gender are
                preset as to appropriate response options, such as “male” or “female.” However, marketing
                researchers  often  desire  to  measure  subjective  properties,  which  cannot  be  directly

                observed because they are mental constructs such as a person’s attitude or intentions.
                Subjective  properties  are  unobservable  and  intangible.  In  this  case,  the  marketing

                researcher  must  ask  a  respondent  to  translate  his  or  her  feelings  or  opinions  onto  a
                measurement continuum, which is not an easy task. To do this, the marketing researcher
                must  adapt  or  develop  rating  scale  formats  that  are  very  clear  and  used  identically  by

                respondents. This process is known as scale development, which is designing questions
                and response formats to measure the subjective properties of an object.
                        Types of measures

                        Nominal measures are defined as those that use only labels; that is, they possess
                only the characteristic of description. Examples include designations as to race, religion,]]></page><page Index="296"><![CDATA[44


                type of dwelling, gender, brand last purchased, and buyer/nonbuyer. Answers involve yes–
                no, agree–disagree, or any other instance in which the descriptors cannot be differentiated

                except qualitatively. If you describe respondents in a survey according to their occupation—
                banker, doctor, computer programmer—you have used a nominal scale. Note that these
                examples  of  a  nominal  scale  only  label  the  consumers.  They  do  not  provide  other

                information such as “greater than,” “twice as large,” and so forth.
                        Ordinal  measures  permit  the  researcher  to  rank  order  the  respondents  or  their

                responses. For instance, if the respondent is asked to indicate his or her first, second, third,
                and fourth choices of brands, the results are ordinally scaled. Similarly, if one respondent
                checks the category “Commute regularly” on a travel-frequency scale and another checks

                the category “Commute infrequently,” the result is an ordinal measurement because we
                know that the first respondent commutes more than the second one, but not by how much.

                Ordinal scales indicate only relative size differences among objects: greater than, less than,
                or equal to.
                        Scale measures are those in which the distance between each level is known. There

                are two types of scale measures. Ratio scale measures are ones in which a true zero origin
                exists— such as an actual number of purchases in a certain time period, dollars spent, miles
                traveled, number of children in the household, or years of college education. As you can

                see, ratio scales are easy for respondents to understand as they are in dollars, times, years,
                or some other familiar denomination. The ratio characteristic allows us to construct ratios
                when comparing results of the measurement. One person may spend twice as much as

                another or travel one-third as far. Interval scale measures are rating scales for subjective
                properties where, for adjacent levels, the distance is normally defined as one scale unit. For

                example, a coffee brand rated 3 in taste is one unit away from one rated 4. Implicitly, equal
                intervals exist between the level descriptors. That is, if you are asked to evaluate a store’s
                salespeople  by  selecting  a  single  designation  from  a  list  of  “extremely  friendly,”  “very

                friendly,”  “somewhat  friendly,”  “somewhat  unfriendly,”  “very  unfriendly,”  or  “extremely
                unfriendly,” the researcher probably assumes that each designation is one unit away from

                the preceding one. In these cases, we say that the scale is an assumed interval.
                        Interval scales may be intuitive for respondents, but they always measure subjective
                properties, and as you will soon learn, they require careful judgment on the part of the

                marketing researcher when used. Because most subjective, or psychological, properties
                exist on a continuum ranging from one extreme to another in the mind of the respondent, it
                is common practice to use interval scale questions to measure them. Sometimes numbers

                are used to indicate a single unit of distance between each position on the scale. Usually,
                but not always, the scale ranges from an extreme negative through a neutral and to an]]></page><page Index="297"><![CDATA[45


                extreme positive designation. The neutral point is not considered zero, or an origin; instead,
                it is considered a point along the continuum.

                        Interval scales commonly used in marketing research. It is not good practice to
                invent a novel scale format with every questionnaire. Instead, marketing researchers often

                fall  back  on  standard  types  used  by  the  industry.  By  now  you  know  that  marketing
                researchers often measure subjective properties of consumers. There are various terms
                and  labels  given  to  these  constructs,  including  attitudes,  opinions,  evaluations,  beliefs,

                impressions,  perceptions,  feelings,  and  intentions.  Because  these  constructs  are
                unobservable, the marketing researcher must develop some means of allowing respondents

                to  express  the  direction  and  intensity  of  their  impressions  in  a  convenient  and
                understandable manner. To do this, the marketing researcher uses interval scales. In this
                section, we will describe the basic interval scale formats that are most common in marketing

                research  practice.  You  will  find  these  scale  formats  time  and  again  on  questionnaires;
                hence, we refer to them as workhorse scales because they do the bulk of the measurement

                work in marketing research.
                        The Likert scale. An interval scale commonly used by marketing researchers is the
                Likert  scale,  in  which  respondents  are  asked  to  indicate  their  degree  of  agreement  or

                disagreement on a symmetric agree– disagree scale for each of a series of statements.
                That is, the scale captures the intensity of their feelings toward the statement’s claim or
                assertion  because  respondents  are  asked  how  much  they  agree  or  disagree  with  the

                statement. With this scale, it is best to use “flat” or plain statements and let the respondent
                indicate the intensity of his or her feelings by using the agree–disagree response continuum
                position.

                        Table 6.6 presents an example of its use in an online survey. The Likert type of
                response format, borrowed from a formal scale development approach introduced by Rensis

                Likert, has been extensively modified and adapted by marketing researchers, so much, in
                fact, that its definition varies from researcher to researcher. Some assume that any intensity
                scale using descriptors such as “strongly,” “somewhat,” and “slightly” is a Likert variation.

                Others use the term only for questions with agree–disagree response options. We tend to
                agree with the second opinion and prefer to refer to any scaled measurement other than an

                agree–disagree dimension as a “sensitivity” or “intensity” scale. But this convention is only
                our  preference,  and  you  should  be  aware  that  different  researchers  embrace  other
                designations. A special application of the Likert question form called the lifestyle inventory

                takes into account the values and personality traits of people as reflected in their unique
                activities, interests, and opinions (AIOs) toward their work, leisure time, and purchases.
                Examples of lifestyle statements are: “I shop a lot for specials,” “I prefer to pay for purchases

                with my debit card,” or “My children are an important part of my life.” Lifestyle questions
                measure consumers’ unique ways of living. These questions can be used to distinguish]]></page><page Index="299"><![CDATA[47


                among types of purchasers such as heavy versus light users of a product, store patrons
                versus non-patrons, or other customer types. They can assess the degree to which a person

                is, for example, price-conscious, fashion-conscious, an opinion giver, a sports enthusiast,
                child oriented, home centered, or financially optimistic. The technique was originated by
                advertising  strategists  who  wanted  to  obtain  descriptions  of  groups  of  consumers  as  a

                means of establishing more effective advertising. The underlying belief is that knowledge of
                consumers’  lifestyles,  as  opposed  to  just  demographics,  offers  direction  for  marketing

                decisions. Many companies use psychographics as a market targeting tool.


                    Table 6.6 Example of a Likert scale
                    Indicate the degree to which you agree or disagree with each of the following statements.












                    The Likert 5-point scale is flexible when it comes to measuring constructs or concepts.

                It  is  also  amenable  to  sophisticated  statistical  analysis  that  has  the  potential  to  reveal
                important relationships or associations among constructs.

                    The  semantic  differential  scale.  A  specialized  interval  scale  format  that  has  sprung
                directly  from  the  problem  of  translating  a  person’s  qualitative  judgments  into  metric
                estimates is the semantic differential scale. Like the Likert scale, this one has been borrowed
                from another area of research, namely, semantics. The semantic differential scale contains

                a  series  of  bipolar  adjectives  for  the  various  properties  of  the  object  under  study,  and
                respondents indicate their impressions of each property by indicating locations along its

                continuum. The focus of the semantic differential is on the measurement of the meaning of
                an object, concept, person, or experience. Because many marketing stimuli have meaning,
                mental  associations,  or  connotations,  this  type  of  synthetic  scale  works  well  when  the

                marketing  researcher  is  attempting  to  determine  brand,  store,  or  other  images.5  The
                construction of a semantic differential scale begins with the determination of a concept or

                object to be rated, usually a brand or company. The researcher then selects bipolar pairs of
                words or phrases that could be used to describe the object’s salient properties. Depending]]></page><page Index="300"><![CDATA[48


                on  the  object,  some  examples  might  be  “friendly–unfriendly,”  “hot–cold,”  “convenient–
                inconvenient,” “high quality–low quality,” or “dependable–undependable.” The opposites are

                positioned at the endpoints of a continuum of intensity, and it is customary to use five or
                seven separators between each point. The respondent then indicates his or her evaluation
                of the performance of the object, say, a brand, by checking the appropriate line. The closer

                the respondent checks to an end point on a line, the more intense is his or her evaluation of
                the object being measured.

                    Table  6.7  shows  a  semantic  differential  scale  for  a  survey  for  Red  Lobster.  The
                respondents also rated Jake’s Seafood Restaurant on the same survey. You can see that
                each respondent has been instructed to indicate his or her impression of various restaurants

                such  as  Red  Lobster  by  clicking  on  the  appropriate  circle  between  the  several  bipolar
                adjective  phrases.  As  you  look  at  the  phrases,  you  should  note  that  they  have  been

                randomly flipped to avoid having all of the “good” ones on one side. This flipping procedure
                is used to avoid the halo effect, 6 which is a general feeling about a store or brand that can
                bias a respondent’s impressions on its specific properties.

                    For instance, let’s say respondents who are big fans of Red Lobster complete a survey
                with all the positive items on the right-hand side and all the negative on the left-hand side;
                they might click on the answers on the right-hand side without reading each characteristic

                carefully. But it is entirely possible that some specific aspects of the Red Lobster dining
                experience  might  not  be  as  good  as  others.  Perhaps  the  restaurant  is  not  located  in a
                convenient  place,  or  the  menu  is  not  as  broad  as  some  might  like.  Randomly  flipping

                favorable and negative ends of the descriptors in a semantic differential scale minimizes the
                halo effect. Also, there is some evidence that when respondents are ambivalent about the

                survey topic, it is best to use a balanced set of negatively and positively worded questions.
                One of the most appealing aspects of the semantic differential scale is the ability of the
                researcher to compute averages and then to plot a “profile” of the brand or company image.

                Each check line is assigned a number for coding. Usually, the numbers 1, 2, 3, and so on,
                beginning  from  the  left  side,  are  customary.  Then,  because  a  metric  scale  is  used,  an

                average may be computed for each bipolar pair. The averages are plotted as you see them,
                and  marketing  researchers  have  a  nice  graphical  communication  vehicle  with  which  to
                report the findings to their clients.]]></page><page Index="301"><![CDATA[49

                opinion for each pair of descriptors.

















































                    The stapel scale. A Stapel scale relies not on bipolar terms but on positive and negative numbers,
                typically ranging from +5 to –5. The scale may or may not have a neutral zero. The Stapel scale is
                easier to construct than a semantic differential scale because the researcher does not need to come
                up with bipolar adjectives for each attribute. It is also flexible to administer as respondents do not
                need to “see” the scale the way they do when responding to a semantic differential scale. However,

                to use a Stapel scale properly, respondents must feel comfortable with the use of negative numbers.

                                      are  not  satisfied,  the  recommendation  is  for  a  symmetric  balanced  scale  to
                                      measure  the  degree  of  dissatisfaction  (Completely  Dissatisfied;  Slightly
                                      Dissatisfied;  Neither  Dissatisfied  nor  Satisfied;  Slightly  Satisfied;  Completely
                                      Satisfied)
                                      Example: Based on your experience with Federal Express, how satisfied have
                                      you been with its overnight delivery service?


                Designing a Questionnaire
                        A questionnaire is the vehicle used to present the questions the researcher desires
                respondents  to  answer.  A  questionnaire  serves  six  key  functions:  (1)  It  translates  the

                research objectives into specific questions asked of respondents. (2) It standardizes those
                questions  and  the  response  categories  so  that  every  participant  responds  to  identical

                stimuli. (3) By its wording, question flow, and appearance, it fosters cooperation and keeps
                respondents motivated throughout the interview. (4) It serves as an enduring record of the
                research. (5) Depending on the data collection mode used, such as online, a questionnaire

                can speed up the process of data analysis. (6) Finally, it contains the information on which
                reliability and validity assessments may be made. In other words, questionnaires are used
                by  researchers  for  quality  control.  Given  that  it  serves  all  of  these  functions,  the

                questionnaire is at the center of the research process. In fact, studies have shown that
                questionnaire design directly affects the quality of the data collected. Even experienced
                interviewers cannot compensate for questionnaire defects. The time and effort invested in

                developing a good questionnaire are well spent.21 Designing a questionnaire requires the
                researcher to go through a series of interrelated steps.]]></page><page Index="303"><![CDATA[51



                Developing Questions

                        Question development is the practice of selecting appropriate response formats and
                wording  questions  that  are  understandable,  unambiguous,  and  unbiased.  Marketing
                researchers take great care in developing research questions that measure (1) attitudes, (2)

                beliefs,  (3)  behaviors,  and  (4)  demographics  because  they  desire  reliable  and  valid
                responses. Question development is absolutely vital to the success of the survey. Here is a

                corny example to make our point that question wording is crucial. How would you respond
                to the following question that might appear on a questionnaire? Are you trying to control
                your compulsive gambling?

                        ___ Yes ___ No
                        If you answer “Yes” or “No,” you are admitting to a gambling addiction. Either way,

                the conclusion is that everyone who took part in the survey gambles compulsively. But we
                all know that everyone is not a compulsive gambler, so the question wording must be flawed,
                and it surely is. A single word can make a difference in how study participants respond to a

                question,  and  there  is  considerable  research  to  illustrate  this  point.  For  example,
                researchers in one study let subjects view a picture of an automobile for a few seconds.
                Then, they asked a single question, but they changed one word. They asked, “Did you see

                the  broken  headlight?”  to  one  group  of  participants  and  asked,  “Did  you  see  a  broken
                headlight?” to another group. Only the “a” and the “the” were different, yet the question
                containing  the  “the”  produced  more  “don’t  know”  and  “Yes”  answers  than  did  the  “a”

                question. Our point is that as little as a one word in a question can result in question bias
                that will distort the survey findings.

                        Unfortunately, words that we use commonly in speaking to one another sometimes
                encourage  biased  answers  when  they  appear  on  a  questionnaire  because  their  literal
                interpretations are impossible to answer. For example, “Did you ever use a Laundromat?”

                means  anytime  in  your  lifetime;  “Did  you  have  any  concerns  about  your  cell  phone’s
                reception?”  means  absolutely  even  the  tiniest  concern,  and  “Do  you  always  buy  Bose

                products?”  means  every  time  without  fail.  These  commonly  used  words  are  extreme
                absolutes, meaning that they place respondents in a situation where they must either agree
                fully or they must completely disagree with the extreme position in the question.

                        Four dos of question wording. Question evaluation amounts to scrutinizing the
                wording of a question to ensure that question bias is minimized and that the question is
                worded so that respondents understand it and can respond to it with relative ease. As we

                noted earlier, question bias occurs when the phrasing of a question influences a respondent
                to answer wrongly or with other than perfect accuracy. Ideally, every question should be]]></page><page Index="304"><![CDATA[52


                examined  and  tested  according  to  a  number  of  crucial  factors  known  to  be  related  to
                question bias. To be sure, question evaluation is a judgment process, but we can offer four

                simple  guidelines,  or  “dos,”  for  question  wording.  We  strongly  advise  ensuring  that  the
                question is: (1) focused, (2) simple, (3) brief, and (4) crystal clear.

                        Focused on a single issue or topic. To the greatest extent possible, the researcher
                must stay focused on the specific issue or topic. For example, take the question “What type
                of hotel do you usually stay in when on a trip?” The focus of this question is hazy because

                it does not narrow down the type of trip or when the hotel is being used. For example, is it
                a business or a pleasure trip? Is the hotel at a place en route or at the final destination? A
                more focused version is “When you are on a family vacation, what type of destination hotel

                do  you  typically  use?”  As  a  second  example,  consider  how  “unfocused”  the  following
                question is: “When do you typically go to work?” Does this mean when do you leave home

                for work or when do you actually begin work once at your workplace? A better question
                would be “At what time do you ordinarily leave home for work?”
                        Brief.  Unnecessary  and  redundant  words  should  always  be  eliminated.  This

                requirement  is  especially  important  when  designing  questions  that  will  be  administered
                verbally, such as over the telephone. Brevity will help the respondent to comprehend the

                central question and reduce the distraction of wordiness. Here is a question that suffers
                from a lack of brevity: “What are the considerations that would come to your mind while you
                are confronted with the decision to have some type of repair done on the automatic icemaker

                in your refrigerator assuming that you noticed it was not making ice cubes as well as it did
                when you first bought it?” A better, brief form would be “If your icemaker was not working
                right, how would you correct the problem?” One source recommends that a question should

                be no more than 20 words long.
                        Grammatically simple. A simple sentence is preferred because it has only a single
                subject and predicate, whereas compound and complex sentences are busy with multiple

                subjects,  predicates,  objects,  and  complements.  The  more  complex  the  sentence,  the
                greater  the  potential  for  respondent  error.  With  more  conditions  to  remember,  the

                respondent’s attention may wane, or he or she may concentrate on only one part of the
                question. To avoid these problems, the researcher should strive to use only simple sentence
                structure—even if two separate sentences are necessary to communicate the essence of

                the question. Take the question “If you were looking for an automobile that would be used
                by the head of your household who is primarily responsible for driving your children to and

                from school, music lessons, and friends’ houses, how much would you and your spouse
                discuss the safety features of one of the cars you took for a test drive?” A simple approach
                is “Would you and your spouse discuss the safety features of a new family car?” followed]]></page><page Index="305"><![CDATA[53


                by (if yes) “Would you discuss safety ‘very little,’ ‘some,’ ‘a good deal,’ or ‘to a great extent’?”
                        Crystal clear. It is best to avoid words that are vague or open to misinterpretations.

                For example, the question “How many children do you have?” is unclear because it can be
                interpreted  in various  ways. One  respondent might  think  of  only those children  living  at
                home, whereas another might include children from a previous marriage. A better question

                is “How many children under the age of 18 live with you in your home?” To develop a crystal-
                clear question, the researcher may be forced to slightly abuse the previous guideline of

                simplicity, but with a bit of effort, question clarity can be obtained with an economical number
                of words. One author has nicely summarized this guideline: “The question should be simple,
                intelligible, and clear.”

                        Four  don’ts  of  question  wording.  In  four situations  question  bias  is  practically
                assured. An awareness of these problem areas can help avoid them or spot them when you

                are reviewing a questionnaire draft. Specifically, the question should not be (1) leading, (2)
                loaded, (3) double-barreled, or (4) overstated.
                        Do  not  “lead”  the  respondent to  a  particular  answer.  A  leading  question  gives  a

                strong  cue  or  expectation  as  what  answer  to  provide.  Therefore,  it  biases  responses.
                Consider this question: “Don’t you worry when using your credit card for online purchases?”
                The respondent is being led because the question wording insinuates that one should worry.

                Therefore, the question “leads” respondents to the conclusion that there must be some
                worries, and, therefore, they will likely agree with the question, particularly respondents who
                have no opinion. Rephrasing the question as “Do you have concerns when using your credit

                card for online purchases?” is a much more objective request of the respondent. Here the
                respondent is free—that is, not led—to respond “yes” or “no.”

                        Do not use “loaded” wording or phrasing. Whereas leading questions are typically
                obvious, loaded questions are stealthy. That is, a loaded question has buried in its wording
                elements a sneaky presupposition, or it might make reference to universal beliefs or rules

                of  behavior.  It  may  even  apply  emotionalism  or  touch  on  a  person’s  inner  fears.  Our
                compulsive gambling question was loaded because it presupposes that respondents have

                a  gambling  problem.  Some  researchers  refer  to  a  loaded  question  simply  as  a  “biased
                question.”  Identifying  bias  in  a  question  requires  thoughtful  judgment.  For  example,  a
                company  marketing  mace  for  personal  use  may  use  the  question,  “Should  people  be

                allowed to protect themselves from harm by using a Taser in self-defense?” Obviously, most
                respondents  will  agree  with  the  need  to  protect  oneself  from  harm,  and  self-defense  is
                acceptable, but these are loaded concepts because no one wants to be harmed and self-

                defense is only legal if one is attacked. Eliminating the loaded aspect of this question would
                result  in  the  question,  “Do  you  think  carrying  a  Taser  is  acceptable  for  someone  who]]></page><page Index="306"><![CDATA[54


                believes it is needed?” As you can see, the phrasing of each question should be examined
                thoroughly to guard against the various sources of question bias error. With the new wording

                of the question in our example, we do not load it by mentioning harm or self-defense.
                        Do not use a “double-barreled” question. A double-barreled question is really two
                different questions posed in one question. With two questions posed together, it is difficult

                for a respondent to answer either one directly. Consider a question asked of patrons at a
                restaurant, “Were you satisfied with the restaurant’s food and service?” How do respondents

                answer? If they say “yes,” does it mean they were satisfied with the food? The service?
                Both? The survey would be much improved by asking two questions: one about the food
                and another about service

                        Do not use words that overstate the case. An overstated question places undue
                emphasis on some aspect of the topic. It uses what might be considered “dramatics” to

                describe the topic. Here is an example that might be found in a survey conducted for Ray-
                Ban sunglasses: “How much do you think you would pay for a pair of sunglasses that will
                protect  your  eyes  from  the  sun’s  harmful  ultraviolet  rays,  which  are  known  to  cause

                blindness?” As you can see, the overstatement concerns the effects of ultraviolet rays, and
                because of this overstatement, respondents may be compelled to think about how much
                they would pay for something that can prevent blindness and not about how much they

                would  really  pay  for  sunglasses.  A  more  toned-down  and  acceptable  question  wording
                would be, “How much would you pay for sunglasses that will protect your eyes from the
                sun’s glare?” Avoid using words that overstate conditions. It is better to present the question

                in a neutral tone rather than in a strong positive or negative tone.

                The Survey Process
                        The  survey  process  is  similar  for  both  researcher-administered  and  self-

                administered  surveys.  First  the  research  question  must  be  written.  As  with  all  forms  of
                research this will be a team effort between researchers and management. The research
                question will help to determine the profile of the sample that will be needed to participate in

                the research. The next step will be to decide upon the method of conducting the survey,
                whether the method is researcher- or self-administered. The survey will then be written and
                tested. The times and locations for researcher-administered surveys must be chosen to

                meet  the  needs  of  participants.  For  self-administered  surveys,  the  dates  for  mailing  or
                emailing a survey will need to be decided. For researcher-administered surveys the next]]></page><page Index="307"><![CDATA[55


                step will be to identify staffing needs and hire and train the personnel who will conduct the
                survey. After the personnel are hired and trained, the survey can be conducted. For self-

                administered surveys, the survey is now mailed or the website is opened, after which a
                researcher will wait for the responses to be returned. Once the data have been returned –
                either by the survey taker, through the mail or electronically – the results are then analyzed

                and the report is written.

                    Conducting a survey
                        The survey process for both phone and personal surveys should proceed through
                the same steps. Survey takers should first be trained to introduce themselves and their

                organization.  They  then  should  explain  the  purpose  of  the  research  and  the  sample
                selection process. This information will be from a script written by the researchers. The

                survey takers should next determine eligibility with one or two screening questions. These
                can be as simple as asking if the person speaking is head of a household, or in a specific]]></page><page Index="308"><![CDATA[56


                age  range,  or  if  they  have  children  living  in  their  household.  After  eligibility  has  been
                determined  survey  takers  should  explain  the  length  of  the  survey  in  terms  of  the  time

                requirement,  not  the  number  of  questions  or  pages.  They  must  then  obtain  consent  to
                proceed with the survey. While the survey is being conducted, a survey taker should be
                prepared to explain confusing questions without leading a participant to provide any specific

                response.  Finally,  a  survey  taker  should  always  sincerely  thank  a  participant  for  their
                assistance.

                    6.  Conduct the survey, clarifying questions when needed
                    7.  Thank the person for their participation

                        There will be occasions when a survey taker contacts a potential participant who
                reacts to the request to participate in the survey with rudeness or even hostility. A survey
                taker should never respond back in kind, as it may damage the reputation of the organization

                conducting the research. Instead, a survey taker must remember not to take the response
                personally and simply move on to the next call. At times, some of these people may wish to
                speak to a supervisor, realizing that the survey taker is not the one responsible for the survey

                call. Supervisors should always be available to handle these calls and soothe any irate
                callers.

                                      Analysis of Qualitative vs Quantitative Data


                       The data from quantitative research are in the form of numbers that can be averaged,
               compared and contrasted. The resulting statistics are used to represent the level of a form of

               consumer  behavior  or  consumer  preference  within  a  targeted  population  segment.
               Management  may  not  understand  how  the  statistics  were  obtained,  but  they  can  easily
               understand the averages and percentages and, therefore, trust the resulting information. In

               contrast, qualitative research results in verbal data and images including recordings, written
               words  and  sometimes  photos  or  videos.  These  data  cannot  be  statistically  manipulated,

               compared  and  contrasted.  In  addition,  the  analysis  does  not  result  in  easily  understood
               percentages.
                       Rather than proving facts using statistics, the analysis of qualitative data has as its

               focus the search for meanings. This is because qualitative research is used to answer the
               question of “Why?” The answer will always be more complicated to explain to management
               than just a percentage or average. In fact, sometimes the reasons for consumer behavior that

               are uncovered through research can be quite surprising.

               The Process of Analyzing Qualitative Data
                       Data organization

                       Data organization involves both the collection and the transformation of the collected
               information. Organization of data according to research question can be particularly important
               for  qualitative  research,  as  the  findings  may  need  to  be  compared  with  the  findings  from

               quantitative data on the same subject (Harradine and Ross, 2007). Some of the data resulting
               from the research might be lists that have been collected on large pieces of paper.

                       Transcribe recordings
                       Qualitative interviews and focus groups will both result in tape recordings that will need
               to be transcribed. If possible, a word for word transcription should be produced. However, if

               there is a great deal of taped material this may not be economically feasible. It is best if the
               researcher who moderated the focus groups or conducted the interviews listens to the tape

               before transcription. While a researcher is actually conducting an interview or moderating a
               focus group, part of their awareness will have to be focused on that process.
                       Listening to the proceedings afterward they can simply focus on what is being said.

               Listening to the tape will refresh a researcher’s memory of what was said. In addition, the tone
               of voice used and even the silences between speech can provide insights.
                       After listening to the tape, transcribing the material is the next step in the analysis

               process. While a researcher is listening to a tape, they can be typing up notes on the main
               points being made. Once the transcription process starts, the researcher can pause the tape
               while they make notes on new insights or memories. For example, there may have been a

               focus  group  member  who  spoke  rarely  but  followed  the  proceedings  closely  with  evident
               interest. This gives more weight to his or her opinions than if the researcher remembered that

               the focus group participant seemed bored and distracted. It is difficult for researchers to take
               notes on behavior during a focus group or interview, as it can disrupt the proceedings and
               make  participants  feel  uncomfortable.  Therefore,  these  notes  should  be  added  to  the

               transcript.  The  same  or  different  participants  will  frequently  repeat  information,  and  a
               researcher can quickly pick up patterns and develop a shorthand notation process.

                       Transcribing tapes is much more than just a technical task, which is why it is best if a
               researcher prepares a transcript personally. The goal of transcription isn’t a word for word
               perfect  transcript.  Instead,  while  the  transcription  is  taking  place,  a  researcher  should

               concentrate  on  recording  information  that  addresses  the  research  question.  While  the
               conversation may stray and other topics be discussed, these topic areas are important only in
               how they relate to the main research question. For example, if the research concerns the cost

               of a product, such as cell phones, participants may start discussing where they like to shop. A
               researcher will then analyze this conversation for its relevance to the research question on]]></page><page Index="311"><![CDATA[59


               cost, by noting whether the stores mentioned are discount outlets or high-priced specialty
               stores. Information on a great sale on shoes that was added by one participant can be ignored.

                       When transcribing a tape, it is not important to note the names of speakers as they do
               not need to be identified personally. However, it is still important to attribute comments to
               individuals to determine if there is consistency in the comments, they provide throughout the

               focus group. Instead of names, a researcher can add a code or a number to represent each
               speaker. In addition, comments on tone of voice or emotion can be added using the same

               system.
                       One means of adding such detail is to type the transcript in a column format. The first
               column will have the words spoken during the session, whether interview or focus group. The

               second column will contain the researcher’s notes on who is speaking, their tone of voice and
               any other observations noticed by the researcher when the research was conducted. The third

               column will be used for coding purposes. Because this column transcript will be referred to
               frequently  during  the  analysis  process,  it  is  important  to  leave  additional  space  where
               handwritten comments can be added.

                       Coding qualitative data
                       Once data have been transcribed and reviewed, researchers will begin to code. Coding
               is used to note the repetition of ideas, opinions or facts. The first coding will be conducted to

               examine the data for answers to the research question. For example, the research question
               might have asked how a visit to the dentist could be made more pleasant. A focus group of
               clients would be asked for their ideas for improvements that could be made to a dental clinic.

               A transcript would be coded for the times when any mention of the ideas for improvements
               was  mentioned.  These  instances  are  coded  so  that  researchers  can  then  return  to  the

               information to analyze if many of the responses gave similar ideas or if any unique suggestions
               were provided. The transcribed notes will then be analyzed again to code other topics that
               arose  during  the  research.  For  example,  besides  discussing  ideas  for  improvements,

               researchers might find that on multiple occasions trouble reaching the dental office due to a
               lack  of  convenient  parking  or  public  transportation  options  was  mentioned.  Another  issue

               discussed might have been the services now offered at a new, competing, dental office. By
               coding these data, researchers may find that it is this new competition that received the most
               mentions.

                       Once researchers have finished coding for concepts, they may find that some need to
               be further broken down into categories. These concepts and categories are important as they
               are the building blocks from which researchers will make their recommendations for action.

               For example, many comments in a transcript may involve the concept of the price of a product.
               Several  participants  may  state  that  they  don’t  buy  a  product  unless  it  is  on  sale.  Other
               participants may state that they buy a competing product because it is cheaper, while some]]></page><page Index="312"><![CDATA[60


               may state directly that the price of a product is too high. While all of these involve the price of
               a product, a researcher may decide they are too dissimilar and break them down into three

               categories:  ‘don’t  buy  because  can’t  afford,  ‘competing  product  purchasers’,  and  ‘non-
               purchasers’. The researcher may then make different recommendations for attracting each of
               the first two groups and recommend no action on the third. Researchers can code transcripts

               using highlighting markers with a different color for each concept and category, or alternatively
               the concept and category name can be noted in the margins of a document. As researchers

               code the material for the answer to a research question, each time a researcher comes across
               a statement that deals with the issue of the price being more than a consumer is willing to pay
               this will be coded. However, with qualitative research there may be other concepts that arise

               that are worth noting (which is one of the benefits of qualitative research). For example, in the
               discussion on price, a researcher might note that several consumers expressed how much

               they enjoyed the design of the product. While the research question had not addressed the
               seasonality of price sensitivity, this would still be useful information for management.

                       Analysis of qualitative data content
                       After  the  data  have  been  organized,  transcribed  and  coded,  the  next  step  in  the

               process of analysis is to determine if there are any relationships between the concepts and
               categories. The purpose of developing relationships is to generate new ideas to answer a
               research question. These new ideas will be the basis for making recommendations for action.

               For example, one qualitative research study was used to examine the cultural effects of the
               country of origin of a product on British consumption behavior. As a result, it was noted that

               country of origin was important for some groups of products (Balestrini et al., 2003).
                       After all, management will want actionable recommendations from a study, not just
               analysis. A report that simply describes researchers’ impressions will not be considered useful

               enough to justify the cost of the research. Possible recommendations might involve how to
               target new types of consumer segments, descriptions of the process of consumer behaviors,
               a comparison and contrast of consumer motivation, or a hypothesis of a relation between

               variables that will need to be verified by future quantitative research.]]></page><page Index="313"><![CDATA[61


                       Coded  qualitative  research  data  can  be  analyzed  for  information  on  possible  new
               market segments to target. A company may be aware of how to market their product to their

               current demographic and geographic segments, but qualitative data might reveal entirely new
               psychographic segments of which that company was unaware. These new segments will have
               been identified based on common values and attitudes that have been verbalized or displayed

               during the qualitative research process. For example, a research focus group on a product for
               older  consumers  might  have  found  that  people  aged  65–75  years  old  do  not  consider

               themselves  as  being  older.  Because  they  are  still  leading  active  lives,  this  segmentation
               category based on age may have no meaning for them. Instead, they may identify themselves
               as ‘active adults’ who just happen to be retired or on their second career. They may also think

               that they have no attitudes in common with people in the traditional category called senior
               citizens.

                       Likewise, qualitative research data may uncover segments of individuals who identify
               with various types of hobbies. What they will all have in common is a specific interest, say in
               crafts,  and  will  therefore  identify  themselves  by  this,  for  example  as  crafters.  Qualitative

               research might also uncover new usage categories. In discussions of food consumption, it
               might be found that food ordinarily consumed at breakfast is also enjoyed at other times of the
               day. Based on a finding that cereal is also eaten at the office, researchers might recommend

               a new promotional campaign based on this usage.
                       Besides  new  market  segments,  qualitative  research  can  provide  insights  into
               consumer behavior processes. A company that makes readymade dinner entrées may be

               interested in the meal preparation processes of today’s busy dual career families. Analysis of
               ethnographic data might reveal that parents would like to have everyone sit down for meals

               together, but that children have their own diet preferences. Using this knowledge, researchers
               could recommend that a company produces prepackaged dinners with a choice of side dishes
               so that everyone can eat together and yet still have the food they each want. If it is found that

               parents still want to have their families maintain a little formality when dining, researchers
               might then recommend that the packaging includes decorative paper napkins.

                       An observational study on how people drive their cars might find that drivers need cup
               holders that can keep their beverages hot or cold when they spend long periods of time in the
               car. In addition, observing children traveling in their car seats may have revealed a need for a

               small  storage  area  for  their  food.  These  are  ideas  that  might  not  otherwise  have  been
               discovered  in  quantitative  survey  research.  However,  analyzing  the  data  from  qualitative
               research can reveal useful ideas such as these that can be recommended to companies.

                       While  researchers  are  analyzing  data,  they  may  note  some  differences  in  the
               consumer behavior process based on demographic or psychographic traits. For example, a
               qualitative research study might have been specifically designed to examine and compare the]]></page><page Index="314"><![CDATA[62


               differences in cell phone usage for different age groups. These types of differences will appear
               in  qualitative  data  from  focus  groups,  interviews  or  ethnographic  studies.  In  this  case

               researchers might perhaps find that women were using the photo feature to take pictures while
               shopping of possible purchases for their home that they can then view later. Meanwhile, it may
               also be found that males were using their cell phone cameras to take candid photos of their

               friends. These are ideas that can be developed into recommendations.
               Analyzing Quantitative Data

                       When  analyzing  the  data  from  quantitative  research,  consumers’  physical
               characteristics such as gender, age, religion, ethnicity, income, education level, or even their
               height,  hair  color  or  weight,  can  be  quantified.  In  addition,  consumers’  behavior  can  be

               quantified by frequency of purchase, consistency of purchase, place of purchase or size of
               purchase. Using statistical analysis, researchers will explain behavior using numbers rather

               than  words.  Furthermore,  if  the  sample  for  a  population  is  sufficiently  large  and  properly
               selected, researchers will be able to say with some certainty that the research findings are
               probably true for the total population (Hellebusch, 2006).

                       Scales of measurement
                       A computer will be used to tabulate the results of a survey, but the findings will still

               need  to  be  analyzed.  Before  the  methods  of  analysis  can  be  discussed  it  is  important  to
               understand measurement scales, as the type of scale used in designing the answer will affect
               the type of statistical analysis used.

                       People  use  measurement  scales  on  a  daily  basis.  When  consumers  decide  to
               purchase a rug for their bathroom floor, they may decide to use their own feet and pace out
               the floor space to be covered. When they go to the store, they can again measure off the

               space using their feet and find a rug that fits. Of course, it is simpler to use a measuring tape
               already marked off with standard units of measurement. In research it is also easier to use
               standard  measurement  scales.  The  four  standard  measurement  scales  researchers  have

               available  are  nominal,  ordinal,  interval  and  ratio.  There  is  a  very  good  reason  why  it  is
               important to understand the differences in measurement scales, as the choice of statistical

               procedure to analyze the data will depend on the scale being used.
                       The nominal scale. The nominal scale is used for characteristics that can be defined
               as different states of being. Male and female, for example, are two characteristics that are

               measured by the nominal scale. There are only the two states and a research participant must
               be one or the other. University graduate and non-university graduate are another example. A

               research participant can be one or the other, but not both. Nominal data are usually analyzed
               by simply counting the responses. A research study might find that of a study of 100 people
               on their favorite hobbies, 62 were male and 38 were female. The report might also state that]]></page><page Index="315"><![CDATA[63


               of  the  100  participants,  78  did  not  graduate  from  university  while  22  did  graduate.  When
               analyzing central tendency, the mode will be used.

                       Ordinal  measurement scale.  The  ordinal  scale  is  used  when  there  is not just  an
               absolute  difference,  such  as  male  or  female,  but  rather  a  degree  of  difference,  such  as
               preference. A question using the nominal scale would be ‘What type of pizza do you prefer?’

               This question, using an ordinal scale, would ask consumers to rank order their favorite types
               of pizza. Analyzing these data would provide a ranking such as participants’ favorite type of

               pizza  topping  is  pepperoni,  followed  by  cheese,  and  then  sausage.  While  this  measure
               provides information on ranking, what this type of measurement does not show is how much
               more popular pepperoni pizza is than cheese or sausage. When analyzing central tendency,

               the median will be used.
                       The interval scale. Using an interval scale will provide more information than just

               ranking. An interval scale adds a unit of measure with a start and finish, and the difference
               between  each  unit  of  measurement  being  the  same.  Researchers  construct  the  scale  by
               creating the starting and ending point of the scale and the units of measurement. In this type

               of ranking participants are given a choice of degrees. The question might ask if the pizza was
               very delicious, delicious, good, all right, or inedible. While the construction of the scale is
               arbitrary, it is assumed that the amount of difference between ‘delicious’ and ‘very delicious’

               is the same as the amount of difference between ‘good’ and ‘all right’. With this type of data
               researchers will be able to provide an average opinion of the pizza by all survey participants.
                       When constructing questions that will provide interval data, researchers can use a

               category rating scale, Likert scale or differential scale. A category rating scale gives a rating
               such as excellent, very good, good, poor, very poor, awful. In a Likert scale, five to seven

               choices are given that measure a participant’s opinion or agreement with a statement. This
               could be strongly agree, agree, undecided, disagree, strongly disagree. A number is attached
               to each category that allows researchers to provide an average. A semantic difference scale

               is also commonly used in interval measurement question construction. In this type of measure
               two opposing statements are made with seven points in between. A participant chooses where

               they stand on the subject by circling a number. An example of a semantic difference scale is
               an answer to the question ‘How would you rank our pizza?’ The possible responses would be
               given as: delicious 1-2-3-4-5-6-7 inedible. When analyzing central tendency, the mean will be

               used.
                       The ratio scale. A ratio scale has given start and end points that already exist and are
               not created by researchers. A consumer’s weight is an example of a ratio scale, as no person’s

               weight can be zero pounds. There is also an upper limit on what a human can weigh and still
               survive. On a ratio scale there is also the ability to measure exactly the difference between
               units. A person who weighs 200 pounds is exactly twice as heavy as a person who weighs]]></page><page Index="316"><![CDATA[64


               100 pounds. The use of the ratio scale in marketing is not as common as the use of the interval
               scale because marketing often asks questions about peoples’ preferences and opinions using

               an interval scale. When analyzing central tendency, the geometric mean will be used.

               Types of Statistical Analyses Used in Marketing Research

                       The problem confronting the marketing researcher when faced with a dataset is data
               analysis, which is defined as the process of describing a dataset by computing a small number
               of statistics that characterize various aspects of the data. Data analysis distills the dataset

               while  retaining  enough  information  so  the  client  can  mentally  envision  its  salient
               characteristics.
                       Five basic types of statistical analyses can be used by marketing researchers to reduce

               a dataset: descriptive analysis, inferential analysis, differences analysis, associative analysis,
               and predictive analysis. Each one has a unique role in the data analysis process; moreover,

               these various methods are usually combined into a complete analysis of the information to
               satisfy the research objectives. These techniques are progressively more complex, but at the
               same time, they convert raw data into increasingly more useful information as they increase

               in complexity.]]></page><page Index="317"><![CDATA[65

               sample dataset in such a way as to portray the “typical” respondent and to reveal the general

               pattern of responses. Descriptive measures are typically used early in the analysis process
               and become foundations for subsequent analysis.

                       Inference  analysis.  When  marketing  researchers  use  statistical  procedures  to
               generalize  the  results  of  the  sample  to  the  target  population  it  represents,  the  process  is

               referred to as inference analysis. In other words, such statistical procedures allow a researcher
               to draw conclusions about the population based on information in the dataset provided by the
               sample. Inferential statistics include hypothesis testing and estimating true population values

               based on sample information.]]></page><page Index="318"><![CDATA[66


                       Hypothesis  testing  is  used  to  compare  the  sample  statistic  with  what  is  believed
               (hypothesized) to be the population value prior to undertaking the study. The standard error is

               a measure of the variability in the sampling distribution based on what is theoretically believed
               to occur were we to take a multitude of independent samples from the same population.
                       Difference  analysis.  Occasionally,  a  marketing  researcher  needs  to  determine

               whether two groups are different. For example, the researcher may be investigating credit card
               usage and want to see if high-income earners differ from moderate-income earners in how

               often they use credit cards. The researcher may statistically compare the average annual peso
               expenditures charged on credit cards by high- versus moderate- income buyers. Important
               market segmentation information may come from this analysis. Or the researcher may run an

               experiment to see which of several alternative advertising themes garners the most favorable
               impression  from  a  sample  of  target  audience  members.  The  researcher  uses  difference

               analysis  to  determine  the  degree  to  which  real  and  generalizable  differences  exist  in  the
               population to help the manager make an enlightened decision on which advertising theme to
               use.  Statistical  differences  analyses  include  the  t  test  for  significant  differences  between

               groups and analysis of variance.
                       Association  analysis.  Researchers  use  other  statistical  techniques  to  determine
               systematic relationships among variables. Association analysis investigates if and how two

               variables are related. For instance, are advertising recall scores positively associated with
               intentions to buy the advertised brand? Are expenditures on sales force training positively
               associated with sales force performance? Depending on the statistic used, the analysis may

               indicate the strength of the association and/or the direction of the association between two
               questions on a questionnaire in a given study.

                       Predictive analysis. Techniques are also available if the researcher is interested in
               determining more complex patterns of associations. Statistical procedures and models are
               available to the marketing researcher to help make forecasts about future events, and these

               fall  under  the  category  of  predictive  analysis.  The  marketing  researcher  commonly  uses
               regression  analysis  to  enhance  prediction  capabilities.  Because  marketing  managers  are

               typically worried about what will happen in the future given certain conditions such as a price
               increase,  prediction  is  desirable.  Predictive  analysis  can  provide  valuable  insight  into  the
               nature of multiple relationships among the variables in a dataset.]]></page><page Index="319"><![CDATA[67


                                            Writing Report and Presentation

                       Marketing researchers should not conduct research purely for the purpose of knowing.

               Research study was conducted to find a solution to the dilemma. While the data has been
               gathered and analyzed, the analysis of the marketing researchers has not yet been completed.
               Over  all,  the  study  done  by  the  marketing  researchers  does  not  solve  the  management

               dilemma. Instead, it is the raw material that provides information that researchers can use to
               make  recommendations  to  solve  the  problem  (Schlaikjer,  2007).  If  the  researchers  have
               finished the study and established the recommendations, the next move is to convey this

               knowledge in a written and oral manner that is both accessible and feasible.


               Reasons for Preparing a Report

                   1.  Explanation of research terminology and methodology
                       Researchers must write a detailed study, since management may not be willing to

                   understand  the  research  methodology  or  the  theoretical  framework  without  a  good
                   description. Terms such as stratified sample’, ‘projective techniques’ or ‘confidence level’
                   might have no significance to anyone whose duty is to make research-based judgments.

                   Without  an  explanation  of  these  terms,  the  data  would  be  either  irrelevant  or
                   misunderstood. Marketing research is often used in fields other than consumer marketing.

                   For example, a study done on political issues may well have a reader acquainted with
                   political strategy but unfamiliar with research methodology (Wring, 2006).
                   2.  Preservation of knowledge for future employees

                       The  second  reason  for  a  written  report  is  that  the  information  obtained  from  the
                   research remains to be accessible in the future. Research findings and recommendations
                   are to be developed by both the marketing and management teams. All businesses have

                   workforce adjustments and it is especially important for marketing personnel to shift roles
                   regularly. Even the manager who commissioned the research may be promoted or leave
                   the company.  If there is no written paper, the new manager would not have access to the

                   information arising from the research study. Under this scenario, duplicate study can be
                   conducted.

                   3.  Documentation of actionable ideas based on research
                       An important purpose of the report is not only to report data or information. The written
                   report is where the recommendations that result from the data and analysis are explained.

                   These  recommendations  are  the  result  of  marketing  researchers’  analysis  and
                   interpretation of the data. These recommendations should be reported as actionable ideas

                   that management should consider implementing.]]></page><page Index="320"><![CDATA[68


                   4.  Clarification in case of misunderstanding

                          A final reason for writing the report is to ensure that the marketing researchers who
                   have conducted the research have a document that details findings and conclusions in
                   case of future misunderstanding. If management makes a decision that causes a future

                   loss  of  revenue,  it  might  be  easy  to  state  that  the  decision  was  based  on  research
                   conducted  by  the  marketing  department.  If  there  is  a  written  document  this

                   misrepresentation can be clarified.

               Writing a Professional Report

                   If the research report is going to be read, instead of just sitting on someone’s desk, it is
               important that it be readable, interesting, and concise. A report that contains too much jargon,

               is poorly organized and is visually unattractive will not be read. This is especially the case
               because  most  people  have  multiple  tasks  to  accomplish  each  day  and  will  complete  the
               easiest task first.

                   Readable. Problems that researchers should consider prior to writing a study may involve
               a writing style. It is just as crucial that the report is presented in the appropriate manner as it
               contains the right information. Before starting to compose a paper, researchers can determine

               about  which  the  research  is  being  written.  When  a  report  is  written  for  someone  in  the
               marketing department, a more professional format would be used. Here it may be expected
               that the reader would be comfortable with the terminology of research. However, if the report

               is written by someone who operates a small business researcher, they may write in a more
               colloquial style while being sure to describe each term.

                   Interesting. Any report should be exciting to read as well. Researchers can not only state
               the truth, but also include descriptions of interesting events that have happened during the
               research process. This sort of information would help to bring the data to life in the reader's

               mind. Another option to bring relevance to the study is to include the images of the people
               participating in the research process. If this is not possible, specific quotations should be used
               to give readers the idea that they were at the research sessions.

                   Concise.  The  report  should  be  kept  as  simple  as  possible  but  also  providing  all  the
               necessary information. It can also be arranged so that readers can access the amount of
               information they want without actually reading the whole report. This can be done by including

               a well-written summary overview and specifically naming of each part. In addition, headings
               and subheadings should be used throughout the report so that a specific issue can be found

               quickly.]]></page><page Index="321"><![CDATA[69


               Using Visual Material

                   The research findings section will contain a wealth of detailed numerical data. A report
               writer  should  use  visuals  to  help  communicate this  information  whenever  possible.  These
               visuals will assist readers in understanding the relationship between different sets of data. To

               assist readers, such detailed data can be presented in the form of tables, charts and graphs.
                   Tables. A table simply lists numbers in rows by categories. Individual numbers will still be

               discussed in the body of the text. However, if the report writer uses a table, they will not need
               to mention all the numbers. For a guide, see example below.































                                        Figure 7.1 Sample of a table in final research paper

                       Pie charts. A pie chart is a visual method to present raw numbers and their relationship
               as percentages of a whole. A pie chart is simply a circle that is divided into areas that are

               represented by size. Pie charts are useful when representing numbers that make up a whole,
               such as the percentage of customers in different age groups. The different sections of a pie
               chart should be shown in various colors or in shades of gray for each group. Using color to

               differentiate the sections makes a pie chart easier to read and use. Pie charts are static, in
               that they do not show changes over time. However, constructing more than one pie chart can
               be used to show how data have changed.]]></page><page Index="322"><![CDATA[70
























                                               Figure 7.2. Example of Pie Chart


                   Bar charts. Bar charts represent the values of different items so that these can be easily
               compared. The difference from pie charts is that bar charts do not necessarily show items that

               are part of a known whole. However, a bar chart will be used to show the relative size of the
               raw numbers of people in each age group who are product users. A bar chart can be shown
               with the bars vertical or horizontal. Bar charts can also be used to show changes over time by

               combining two sets of numbers collected at different dates. Each set of data can be shown
               next to each other on the chart.


















                                        Figure 7.3. Example of horizontal and vertical bar graphs


                   Line charts. A line chart is designed to show changes in data over periods of time. Time
               is shown on the horizontal axis, while the numerical measurement is shown on the vertical

               axis. A line chart can show the percentage change in a product’s sales by any measurement
               of time, such as by the day, month, season or year. The advantage of a line chart is that it can
               easily display movement in a value over time for more than one variable.]]></page><page Index="323"><![CDATA[71

               Oral Presentation

                       An  oral presentation  is an  opportunity  for  researchers to  clarify  and 'market' some
               findings  and  recommendations  from  the  research.  The  oral  analysis  often  encourages

               researchers  to  provide  a  more  accurate  description  of  the  research  methodology.  This  is
               because, during an oral presentation, the presenter, by observing their audience, may become
               mindful of where they encounter difficulties and can clarify some conflicting information more

               thoroughly. In addition, the presenter should clarify more precisely how the recommendations
               of the study apply to the findings of the research. Finally, an oral presentation provides a
               means to clarify any misunderstandings about the research process.


               Reasons for Oral Presentation

                  •   Α clearer explanation of methodology
                  •   An opportunity to explain the tie between research findings and recommendations
                  •   An opportunity to clarify misunderstandings

                   Everyone knows that a good presentation requires preparation. However, not everyone
               knows that there are other issues that must be considered if a presentation is to proceed
               flawlessly. These include:

                   Know the audience – including who they are, what they already know about the subject,
               what they want to learn from the presentation, and what management wants them to learn

               from the presentation.
                   Know the surroundings – including the comfort of the room, where the audience will sit,
               where the presenter will stand, whether the layout will allow the presenter to circulate around

               the room and the availability of flip charts, white boards and computer equipment
                   Know  the  presentation  –  including  the  length  of  time  required  by  practicing  the
               presentation while using the required equipment, either alone or in front of others.

                       In addition, a presentation should be performed in the same room if possible in front of
               a  similar  audience  that  will  be  used  later.  A  rehearsal  presentation  would  mean  that  the]]></page><page Index="324"><![CDATA[72


               presenter will be happier before the final presentation is made, and will be able to reflect on
               the crowd instead of the presentation.

               What to Avoid during Oral Presentation?
                   1.  Reading out the report
                   2.  Presenting PowerPoint slides that are unreadable

                   3.  Boring the audience
                   4.  Not interacting with the audience

                   5.  Using too much supporting material
                   6.  Not being emotionally involved with the presentation’s contents





                                               Communicating Findings

                       Research is not complete until it is written up and discussed results, not only with other
               researchers who can develop on it and further progress the study, but also with others who

               can benefit from it, who can use it, and who have an interested in it. Etymologically, the Latin
               "communio" is for engagement and collaboration. Communication and collaboration are two
               terms that express the same idea.

               Why Communicate Research Results?
                   1.  Essential for utilization

                   2.  Allows for other researchers to critique
                   3.  Stimulates others to replicate or develop similar studies
                   4.  Provides rewards for the researcher

                         •    Recognition
                         •    Advancement

                         •    Psychological boost
                         •    Financial compensation
                   5.  No research project is complete until the final report has been written

                   6.  Theses and dissertations
                   7.  Research results presented at professional

                   8.  Publishing a journal article
                   9.  Improve the dissemination and repackaging of research for continuing knowledge.
                   10. Strengthen the networking between researchers, policymakers and practitioners as

                       standard evidence-based practice.]]></page><page Index="325"><![CDATA[73


               Common Problems in Preparing the Marketing Research Report

                   •   Lack of data interpretation
                   •   Unnecessary use of complex statistics
                   •   Emphasis on packaging instead of quality

                   •   Lack of relevance
                   •   Placing too much emphasis on a few statistics

               Guidelines for Preparing Oral Presentations
                   •   Visual component should not detract from the information being communicated

                   •   Be friendly, honest, warm, and open your oral communication
                   •   Delivery should be knowledgeable and confident

                   •   Have a well-organized and inspiring dialogue prepared
                   •   Be an effective active listener
