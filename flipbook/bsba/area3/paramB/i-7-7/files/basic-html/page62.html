               The brand initially came out with new kind of distribution known as the sales party plan. This had one
        specific consumer demonstrate the product among his neighborhood and other consumers would probably
        pick up the product if they were impressed with it. When this was not working, the company decided to sell it

        through the conventional distribution route. The company took the extra precaution of trying to advertise the
        product in several kinds of media vehicles. It was there on television. It was there on newspapers. It was
        there on a variety of media. Despite these efforts, the question is, did the product succeed? So, the first

        message for the marketeer is that the marketeer would be interested in imparting learning to the consumer
        in a certain manner, but the consumer may not really be receptive to this kind of learning.
               Let us take the case of biscuits. Biscuit is a commonplace product. All of us know that, people from

        different kinds of age groups enjoy it and there are a variety of well-known brands in the Indian context. One
        can easily see that the involvement associated with learning associated with biscuits is very different from

        that which was associated with vacuumizer. There are differences with respect to products, differences with
        respect to usage, and differences with respect to how different sets of consumers from different segments
        even perceive it.

               Let us take the case of iPad or iPod or iPhone. The receptivity among consumers is so strong that
        consumers not only buy these products, many consumers learn how to use them and the diffusion or the

        spread of these products is almost revolutionary. The question is how did consumers learn with respect to
        iPhone and how did they not learn or were reluctant to learn when it came to vacuumizer. And in between,
        there is some learning that is going on with respect to these kids.

               Learning therefore, explores a number of aspects associated with how consumers learn. There are
        three things important from the viewpoint of learning. One, the consumer must have the motivation to learn.
        It has to come from within. The second point is that the marketeer has to ensure that whatever he says about

        his offering or the offering itself has to be in line with the consumer's motivation. And that's not the end of the
        story. The marketeer will have to ensure that the learning he imparts, or the company imparts is superior to
        the learning imparted by the competitors. So, these three basic aspects of learning are to be borne in mind

        before we go further into learning concepts.
        What is Learning?

               Learning is a process that evolves from changes as consumers acquire knowledge from experience
        and observations and interactions with others. There are several important aspects of this definition.
               First thing is it is a process, which also means that it is continuous. A consumer learns about products,

        services, circumstances, situations, categories, almost throughout his life. This can be any type of consumer.
        This can be a consumer who is struggling to make both ends meet, or it could be a consumer who is very

        rich and has a lot of discretionary income.
               Second aspect is that learning is dynamic. That was the reason why I asked you, do we use the same
        kind of cosmetics that we were using 10 years back?

               Third aspect is that there is knowledge, knowledge from experience, observations, and interactions
        with  others.  Essentially,  we  are  not  learning  in isolation. We are  learning  through  social  media. We  are

                                                                                                              48</code></pre>
