It has two                        branches: microeconomics and macroeconomics. Microeconomics deals with the behavior of                        individual  components  such  as  household,  firm,  and  individual  owner  of  production  while                        macroeconomics study the economy as a whole.                               This  module  is  for  business  management  students  who  are  taking  a  course  in                        microeconomics. It aims to provide relative information to understand the economic behavior                         of individuals, household, and firm in making economic choices. Economics, as a whole, can                        add knowledge for students who want to become successful entrepreneurs in the future. If they                        will establish their own business, aside from the basics of how to manage your own business,                        they need to know how the economy works, starting from the individual components, as their                        business will be part of it.                               The  topics  included  in  this  module  are  the  art  and  science  of  economic  analysis,                         economic tools, and economic systems. Demand and supply, the fundamental and powerful                        economic tool, its elasticity to price change, consumer and producer behavior, as well as the                        market structures are also included.                               May  the  students  who  will  use  this  module  find  microeconomics  challenging  and                        interesting.

Quantitative analysis helps in evaluating performance, assessing                financial  instruments,  and  making  predictions.  It  encompasses  three  main  techniques  of                measuring data: regression analysis, linear programming, and data mining.                        This module will introduce to you the importance of quantitative techniques in solving                managerial problems.  It helps you understand the step-by-step process in the quantitative                approach. It generally aims to perform a review analysis of a business model case study and                assess the potential effectiveness of the solution methodology.
