                                       VIDEO COMMENTARY REPORT WEEK 15-17


             Videos on Conceptualization of Consumer Behavior


             I have watched a very interesting video explaining the Conceptualization of consumer behavior. This
             taught us numerous things that might help us in the future needs since it talks about numerous factors
             that can broaden our knowledge towards this subject. Conceptualization is the process of building ideas
             or thoughts towards different product. He gave us example like dove and air fryer to explain how we
             perceived this product or how market discern this product. In regard to this example, Dove sees as a
             moisturizing bar and a beauty bar that make it stand out in soap categories. These examples can help
             us know how it is possible for us to monitor consumer attitude towards development categories and
             varieties that can be found in the marketplace. Also, he explains four main aspect in conceptualization
             of  consumer  behavior  these  are:  Industry  Structure,  Competitive  Structure,  Manner  of  Positioning
             Brands and Respective Audience. These aspects are explained through the use of his example and I
             believe when we say industry structure it explains the planning of a business or product that can manage
             the company strategies, Competitive structure talks about on how can a product compete in different
             varieties in the market, Manner of positioning brands defined as how we put our product in our consumer
             minds,  and  respective  audience  discuss  about  our  consumer  of  the  product  itself.  In  addition,  the
             relevance of this video is about how can we put our knowledge into the real situation since it also
             explains that market research takes place in knowing the desire and preference of your consumer. Like
             what  he  said  “Without  the  application  of  marketing  techniques,  the  conceptualization  of  consumer
             behavior  cannot  be  operationalized”  because  it  is  like  a  sequence  or  a  process  of  knowing  and
             improving the various ideals of your consumer and its behavior.


             Videos on Consumer Profiling

             Consumer  profiling  has  a  two  aspect  the  1   one  is  the  demographic  the  scientific  distribution  of
                                                         st
             population in terms of age, income, educational aspects. The demographics basic information such as
             gender,  age,  marital  status  and  education  second  the  psychographic  focus  on  understanding
             the consumer's emotions and values, so you can market more accurately.


             Videos on Value Associated with Brands

             Brand value is the economic value of the sustain it refers to the monetary value of a brand or it’s worth
             in currency Coca Cola’s brand value for example is estimated 81 millions dollars McDonald’s brand
             value is 124 billion dollars Mcdonald’s he corporate brand value in their franchise fee making it one of
             the most valuable brand names today brand value can also be a reflection of investor confidence to the
             business a company’s net worth share price and revenues can be uses to determined brand value.]]></page><page Index="6"><![CDATA[Videos on Act of Shopping

             Shopping is an activity in which a customer browses the available goods or services presented by one
             or more retailers with the potential intent to purchase a suitable selection of them. A typology of typer
             shops has  been  developed  by  scholars  which  identifies  one  group  of  shoppers  as  recreational
             shoppers,  that is, those who enjoy shopping and view it as a leisure activity
             Shopping frenzies are periods of time where a burst of spending occurs, typically near holidays in the
             United States, with Christmas shopping being the biggest shopping spending season, starting as early
             as October and continuing until after Christmas.
             Some religions regard such spending seasons as being against their faith and dismiss the practice.
             Many  contest  the  over-commercialization  and  the  response  by  stores  that  downplay  the  shopping
             season often cited in the War on Christmas.
             The National Retail Federation (NRF) also highlights the importance of back-to-school shopping for
             retailers which comes second behind holiday shopping, when buyers often buy clothing and school
             supplies for their children In 2017, Americans spent over $83 billion on back-to-school and back-to-
             college shopping, according to the NRF annual survey.
             Seasonal  shopping  consists  of  buying  the  appropriate clothing for  the  particular season.  In  winter
             people bundle up in warm layers and coats to keep warm, while in summer people wear less clothing
             to stay cooler in the heat. Seasonal shopping now revolves a lot around holiday sales and buying more
             for less. Stores need to get rid of all of their previous seasonal clothing to make room for the new trends
             of the upcoming season The end-of-season sales usually last a few weeks with prices lowering further
             towards the closing of the sale. During sales items can be discounted from 10% up to as much as 50%,
             with  the  biggest reduction  sales  occurring  at the  end  of  the  season.  Holiday  shopping  periods  are
             extending their sales further and further with holidays such as Black Friday becoming a month-long
             event stretching promotions across November . These days shopping doesn't stop once the mall closes,
             as people have more access to stores and their sales than ever before with the help of the internet and
             apps.

                                                         INTRODUCTION



                              Kuya J Group Holdings Inc. is a food service organization that offers 30 Filipino

                       Dishes for more than eight years and continues to serve a delicious and satisfying menu


                       locally. Their primary mission is to provide a Filipino taste cuisine and a Homey restaurant

                       atmosphere that will satisfy consumer preferences.


                              Moreover, Kuya J a local Filipino restaurant was established in January 2013 at

                       Escario,  Cebu,  from  being  an  eatery  known  as  “Ang Kan-anan ni Kuya J”,  the  owner

                       reorganized the establishment to a restaurant which is popularly known now as “Kuya J’s

                       Restaurant” with 106 branches all over the country. According to the owner the name Kuya


                       J was derived from the common Filipinos name such as; Jose, Jesus, James, and Jericho

                       and he believes that Kuya J is the appropriate name because most Filipino families have

                       a ‘J’ in their family, so he sees that Kuya J is very suitable for our restaurant.


                              Winglip K. Chang is the president and chief executive officer of iKitchen Inc., the

                       premier company behind Kuya J Restaurant. According to him, “Kuya J before is not the

                       same as Kuya J now, we retained the name Kuya J because we felt that the brand is


                       something we could use and own. We wanted it to represent  somebody who is a big

                       brother and somebody who cares to do it right".


                              They started as a humble eatery along the streets of Cebu and now making waves

                       to  capture  the  hearts  of  not  only  Cebuanos  but  also  Manileños  and  the  rest  of  the

                       Philippines by establishing a lot of branches, franchising their brand, and maximizing their

                       opportunities and Strengths. Also, the effective marketing strategy of the brand that makes


                       Kuya J Restaurant successful are the mouthwatering Filipino dishes that are made from

                       the heart, paired with remarkable service. Kuya J’s mission is to let their customers have

                       a heartwarming experience at any time of the day. Love is deep-rooted in the history of]]></page><page Index="15"><![CDATA[7


                       Kuya J, present until today and as it moves towards its future and Kuya J assures the staff

                       is always welcoming with heartfelt service. The ambiance should not be compromised by

                       making every customer feel relaxed and comfortable.



                       Although  Kuya  J  restaurant  has  good  strategic  planning,  their  operations  in  fulfilling

                       customers' satisfactions, such as; customer service, the food itself, and the relation of the

                       staff in customers' do not fully satisfy the market and it can be a threat for Kuya J.


                       In terms of managing the restaurant, Kuya J’s Restaurant is also facing incompetency. It

                       has a poor service, serving of the food is too slow and some of these are half cooked or

                       overcooked and it’s causing trouble for their strategies. The ‘spotlight’ in one restaurant is


                       the serving and the food, indeed. They have expensive food came in a big plate but have

                       a small quantity, that automatically a disappointment to customer's, obviously they should

                       put the food into a suitable plate which occupied how a length or weight of the food is.

                       Kuya J's Restaurant should be aware what are the customers needs and wants so they

                       can satisfy their customers.


                       As  well  as  managing  employees,  Kuya  J  must  also  develop  excellent  employee


                       management because prior employees have complained about their lack of management

                       assistance, which could also lead to poor customer satisfaction since employees are the

                       ones who communicate with customers.]]></page><page Index="16"><![CDATA[8

                       I.     Industry Analysis

                              A.  Industry features

                                 The  food  industry  is  very  large,  and  if  food  production,  manufacturing,

                                 marketing, restaurants and institutions are combined, it is the largest industrial

                                 enterprise.  An  appreciation  of the  size,  components,  interrelationships, and

                                 responsiveness  to  change  of  the  food  industry  enlarges  food  scientists’


                                 understanding of the environment in which they operate.



                              B.  Industry Boundaries

                                 From  the  word  boundary  itself  which  means  a  border  or  a  limit,  industry

                                 boundaries could be defined as the point at which industries ends or beyond

                                 which it becomes something else. This means that industry boundaries are the

                                 demarcations between two distinct industries, and so it encompasses both the


                                 supply and demand trajectories.

                                 Understanding  the  industries  and  its  sectors  and  monitoring  the

                                 macroeconomic  environment  are  the  two  main  objectives  of  industry

                                 boundaries whereby organizational strategies are at the core of the business

                                 conduct.




                              C.  Industry Environment

                                 Restaurants and other food-service providers are so widespread that half of all

                                 adults have worked in food service in one way or another at some point in their

                                 lives. The food service industry encompasses any establishment that serves]]></page><page Index="25"><![CDATA[17


                                 food  to  people  outside  their  home.  This  includes  restaurants,  carryout

                                 operations, cafeterias, university dining halls, catering and vending companies,

                                 hotels and inns, and rehab and retirement centers.




                                 This industry is divided into two groups: Those that prepare and serve food and

                                 those that produce and distribute food, equipment, and services needed by

                                 food providers. The most common example of the first group is restaurants.

                                 Restaurants employ front of the house people and back of the house people.

                                 The  former  includes  bartenders,  wait  staff,  hosts,  and  busboys.  The  latter


                                 includes chefs, cooks, managers, and dishwashers. Fast food restaurants limit

                                 their staff to food preparation people, managers, and cashiers. The trend of

                                 food trucks adds a mobile component to food service and requires just a few

                                 people to drive the truck, cook the food, and serve it through a window.



                              D.  Industry Structure

                                 Foodservice establishments are projected to capture 53 percent of consumers’


                                 food  expenditures,  whereas  in  1980,  foodservice  captured  less  than  40

                                 percent. The foodservice industry accounts for approximately 4 percent of the

                                 Gross  Domestic  Product  and  about  11  million  jobs.  It  has  been  rapidly

                                 changing  due  to  economic  factors,  technological  advances,  and  labor

                                 matters.1 This overview covers many of the issues and trends affecting the


                                 different segments of the foodservice supply chain including the foodservice

                                 operators,  distributors  and  food  manufacturers.  Changing  customer

                                 demographics are a driving force in the evolution of the foodservice industry.

                                 As the baby boomers reach middle age, they do not seem to have time to cook

                                 and their children and grandchildren do not seem to have the interest, or talent.]]></page><page Index="26"><![CDATA[18




                              E.  Industry attractiveness

                                 Products  will  continue  to  roll  out  to  meet  consumers’  health  and  wellness

                                 desires, and plant-based meats will keep making a dent in the market.


                                 Food and beverage service is the essential link between the customers and

                                 the menu,  beverages  and  other  services  on  offer  in  an  establishment. The

                                 server  is  the  main  point  of  contact  between  the  customers  and  the

                                 establishment  and  plays  an  important  role  in  a  profession  with  increasing

                                 national and international status.




                              F.  Industry Performance

                                 A performance appraisal for customer service expectations is more than simply

                                 evaluating employees on whether they greet customers with a smile or whether

                                 managers effectively resolve conflicts with suppliers who fail to provide high-

                                 quality food products for use in their restaurants. Performance appraisals for

                                 customer service in the F&B world delve deeper into duties such as how to


                                 ensure each restaurant patron has an enjoyable dining experience or the ability

                                 for  a  bartender  to  take  off  his  mixologist  hat  and  make  the  transition  to

                                 psychologist and confidante for a customer who stops in to have a cocktail after

                                 a stressful day in the office. Service standards also include the techniques for

                                 recommending selections to customers based on questions about customers’


                                 preferences, how to approach customers throughout their meal and the timing

                                 that wait staff should use when deciding whether to recommend the dessert

                                 selections or simply bring the bill.]]></page><page Index="27"><![CDATA[19


                              G.  Industry Practices

                                 The  food  industry  is  very  large,  and  if  food  production,  manufacturing,

                                 understanding of the environment in which they operate.



                              H.  Industry’s future prospect

                                 Between displaced demand from restaurants, constant innovation, and new


                                 safety  and  operational  challenges,  the  retail  foodservice  industry  has  been

                                 through  more  in  the  past  six  months  than  in  the  prior  six  years.  Throw  in

                                 continued uncertainty regarding consumer behavior and COVID-19 this fall,

                                 and impossible sales comparisons in the spring, and food retailers are faced

                                 with a set of circumstances unlike anything they’ve dealt with before. Beyond

                                 the basics of safety measures, the big opportunity going forward, according to

                                 Stein, is to elevate awareness of prepared foods and digitally integrate the


                                 offerings so they are available for pickup or delivery.]]></page><page Index="28"><![CDATA[20

                    A shell or seashell, additionally referred to just as a shell, is a hard, defensive external

               layer for the most part made by a creature that lives in the ocean. The shell is important for

               the body of the creature. Void shells are frequently tracked down appeared on sea shores by

               wanderers. The shells are unfilled in light of the fact that the creature has kicked the bucket

               and the delicate parts have deteriorated or been eaten by another creature.

                    A shell is normally the exoskeleton of an invertebrate (a creature without a spine), and is

               ordinarily made out of calcium carbonate or chitin. Most shells that are found on sea shores


               are the shells of calcium carbonate, and bear better compared to shells made or chitin.

                    Aside from mollusk shells, different shells that can be found on sea shores are those of

               barnacles, horseshoe crabs and brachiopods. Marine annelid worms in the family Serpulidae

               make shells which are tubes made of calcium carbonate solidified onto different surfaces. The

               shells of ocean imps are designated ‘tests’, and the shed shells of crabs and lobsters are


               exuviae. While most shells are outside, a few cephalopods have interior shells.

                    Our product which is Luscious Seashell can use as gifts or souvenir in any events, it can

               also use as decoration in house specially in kitchen or dining room.

                    Shells have been utilized by people for various purposes since the beginning and ancient

               times.  In  any  case,  shells  are  not  by  any  means  the  only  sort  of  shells;  in  different

               environments, there are shells from freshwater creatures, for example, freshwater mussels

               and freshwater snails, and shells of land snails.]]></page><page Index="62"><![CDATA[PRODUCT OVERVIEW





               I. Product Concept

                    Seashells or simply shells have various types and sizes. Animals from the sea are the

               ones who usually create it. These shells are mostly collected from around the world because

               of its vivid and unique construction. They are used for decorations, jewelry and buttons in the

               industry. Hence, they are not only used as display but also some of them can be eaten. These


               shells also help the country’s economy because of its uses and can be a great medium for

               researches.

                    Since Philippines is surrounded by bodies of water, we can’t deny that or country is fond

               of seashells. Plenty of handicrafts and decorations are being made of it. In 2016, Department

               of science and Technology (DOST) granted to boost the Capiz’ handicraft production in Cavite


               known in the Philippines as the mother-of-pearl shells. The granted them a new set of planting

               facility  with  complete  accessories  and  low-cost  furnace  dry  to  develop  and  enhance  the

               production capacity and quality. Through this, Cavite will be able to promote the importance

               of seashells to the industry and spread awareness on how these shells help or ecology to

               move forward. According to the 2001 Fisheries Administrative Order 208 of Philippines Laws,

               they must protect and conserve the rare, threatened and endangered species od shells from

               the people who collects and damages them only for their personal purposes.


                    We may think that shells are just shells but to biodiversity and ecology they mean so much

               than just a decoration. Shells are said to be the major players in the web of life. Once they are

               wiped out it would result in ecological imbalance that would result not only to our loss but also

               to the animals who mostly relies on it. It serves as the shelter of smaller marine lifeforms and

               some of kind of crabs. Some shells help fight the ocean acidification and the removal of large

               shells will also affect the rate of shore erosion.]]></page><page Index="63"><![CDATA[II. Market Size

                    According to Paul Zahl Ph. D. of National Geographic (1969), Philippines together with its


               thousands of islands, reefs and marine habitats, the country is considered a mecca of sea

               shell collectors. Along the vast region of the Philippines lies the Indo-Pacific region of the

               Philippines lies the Indo-Pacific region which contains the world’s most diverse sea shells.

               One of the best hunting grounds are said to be in the islands of Sulu Sea and also the province

               of Cavite.


                    There are 12,000 or more species of seashells in the Philippines, both the largest shells,

               Tridacna gigas, and smallest shells, Pisidum, can be found on the Philippines waters. Not only

               does the country has beautiful seashells but also has shells that can be eaten. It is common

               in Philippine cuisine to have different foods with shells such as mussels, mollusks and oyster.

                    Also, based on the study by Solidum, J.N (2011), several coastal islands especially the

               province of Cavite, produce most of the various types of shell waste that are normally thrown

               away on open garbage areas which somehow cause numerous problems to the citizens. So,


               in order to lessen the wastes being deployed, the wastes being reused and recycled. One of

               the products which clearly shows the reuse and recycle method is the Luscious Seashells. It

               consists  of  shells  that  are  beautifully  arranged  and  gathered  in  a  glass  dome  to  use  as

               decoration.

               III. Consumer Trends

               many more. People who have a great fashion attitude use to decorate their own room to make

               it more look beautiful and good in their own eyes. Besides they also did that for them to impress

               who visits their room. Seashells are the number one that comes to our mind that can use for

               decoration because are easy to find yet net expensive. But there are people who don’t know

               the value of seashells until you recycled it. So that we decided to make Luscious Seashells

               A.  Company Background

                        A seashell or sea shell, also known a simply as a shell, is a hard, protective outer layer
               usually created by an animal that lives in the sea. The shell is part of the body of the animal.
               Empty seashells are often found washed up on beaches by beachcombers. The shells are
               empty because the animal has died and the soft parts have decomposed or been eaten by
               another animal.

               an affordable and convenient price.]]></page><page Index="77"><![CDATA[PRODUCT OVERVIEW



               I.  Product Concept

                    Filipinos  always  finds  a  way  of  adopting  anything  foreign  that  we  like  If  not  that,  the


               Filipinos  may  just  have  our  own  version  of  something  and  does  not  have  to  copy  from

               foreigners. Whichever is the case, there is a Filipino version of the meatloaf – the Embutido.

                    Much like lumpia, Embutido is a popular dish prepared and enjoyed at Filipino gatherings

               and other special occasions. It can be served hot or chilled, and is usually dipped in banana

               ketchup or some other type of dipping sauce. Embutido is a staple Filipino dish for the holidays.


               But many homes do not limit their enjoyment of the embutido to a holiday. The dish maybe

               prepared in volume and stored in the refrigerator to last for several days or weeks. Then it

               may be enjoyed every day or anytime during the day while it lasts.


                    Many Filipino families have their own heirloom embutido recipes. Which may be taken to

               mean that the dish has been around in the country for quite a while already – “a while” meaning

               several generations. Yes, different embutido recipes would have their own twist to the dish.

               Embutido may be served fresh from the fridge or fresh from the frying pan. And while embutido

               is basically meatloaf, when the dish is called embutido the suggestion is that it’s homemade.


               Meatloaf is mainly understood as the commercial type found in supermarkets while embutido

               is the type that is especially made at home.

                    As of our own version, we further developed the popularly known Filipino dish, Embutido

               into Tinapa-embutido or smoked-fish embutido. It is a fish counterpart and took inspiration

               of the iconic Filipino meatloaf, which is the Embutido. It uses the equally iconic 'Tinapa' known

               as 'smoked-fish', which is abundant especially in the southern province of Cavite, specifically,

               at the coastal town of Tanza. The origin of using Fish in exchange of other proteins such as


               chicken or pork meat in the traditional embutido, can be traced when Spain colonized the

               Philippines for three and a half centuries beginning in the middle of the 15th century. During

               that time, the Spaniards introduced different recipes. In other words, “Embutido” belongs to a]]></page><page Index="78"><![CDATA[category of sausage recipes during the Spanish colonial period. Like most Filipino dishes in

               Philippine culinary history, Embutido has evolved over the passage of time from its Spanish

               origin.  Embutido  was  developed  by  Filipinos  to  suit  their  own  taste  and  liking,  hence  the

               development of 'Tinapa-embutido' also now known as Tinudopa.

                    The  love  of  meat  products  by  local  consumers  in  the  Philippines  saw  a  rise  in  meat

               consumption, most specifically for pork meat. By 2021, it was forecasted that pork would be

               the most consumed type of meat in the Philippines at approximately 15 kilograms per person


               per annum. The leading meat products consumed in the country are chicken and pork based.

               In 2020, the pork consumption per capita in the Philippines was about 14.9 kilograms per

               person,  while  13.74  kilograms  of  poultry  meat  per  capita  were  consumed  per  person.  In

               situations where animal feeds are at a shortage due to adverse weather conditions, or rising

               fuel prices halt the deliveries of meat, ripple effects are manifested mainly in pricing. In this

               case,  consumer's  interest  in  purchasing  meat  steers  the  increasing  domestic  price  of  the

               market.


                    Filipino consumers shop almost daily on a needs basis in wet and dry markets, which

               make up the largest distribution channel for fishing industry. With this being said, consumers

               now  look  for  alternatives  in  pork  or  chicken  meat,  which  are  Fish.  And  according  to  the

               Department of Agriculture (2021), Fish are now more affordable as supply stabilizes in Metro

               Manila, which also means, that the price of local-fresh marine fish commodities in the NCR


               has begun to stabilize. With the resumption of large supplies of fresh marine commodities in

               the market, consumers now have more affordable fish to choose from and put on their tables.

               The abundance of supply now is perfectly in time with the country's urgent need to ramp up

               efforts to ensure the nation's food security as we battle an even stronger challenge of the

               covid-19 pandemic.]]></page><page Index="79"><![CDATA[III. Consumer Trends

                    The  simplest  dishes  are  often  the  best,  and  proof  of  this  is  the  humble  embutido  or

               meatloaf. It’s practically just a log of minced meat peppered with whatever ingredients and

               techniques are available in the country it is adapted in.


                    In South Africa, there’s bobotie, which is spiced with curry and topped with eggs, while in

               the Middle East, the meat, made typically with lamb, clings onto sticks as they are grilled.

               Indonesia has otak-otak where fish replaces beef, and, instead of being baked, is wrapped in

               banana leaves then kissed by hot charcoal. Another technique used is steaming, like on the

               Chinese zheng rou bing, which is composed of pork and scallions. There are many other


               variations:  Vietnam  has  gio,  Bulgaria  has rulo  Stefani,  Chile  has  asado aleman, Italy  has

               polpettone, and our country has embutido, the egg-embedded, raisin-speckled meatloaf of our

               youth.


                    Not everyone's a fan of embutido partly because it is a mix of ground pork, hotdog, boiled

               eggs, relish, raisins etc. and then people can eat it cold which makes it more pretty unsettling.

               But  still,  there  are  those  who  love  the  dish  enough  that  it  remains  a  staple  at  all  special


               occasions and gatherings. Therefore, Filipinos have come up with different versions of it to

               eat during holidays or on a daily basis as 'ulam'. In our case, we use Tinapa or Smoked Fish

               in exchange of pork meat, making it an even affordable dish.


                    There is currently little to no direct competition for Tinapa Embutido as it is neither popular

               nor well-known in the market. Not only it has a different approach on how Tinapa was usually

               served, but also it is an affordable alternative in the kitchen instead of using chicken or pork

               meat on Embutido. This gives our product a unique and distinct competitive advantage as well

               as the fact that it is easy to distinguish for the consumers. It is a fresh, and home-made product


               that  can  be  prepared  just  as  simply  as  the  store-bought  brands  or  fried  directly  for  the

               customers upon purchase.


                    Believed to have been introduced during the American occupancy, the embutido is an

               underrated dish usually reserved for special occasions. But its simplicity begs regularity. Its]]></page><page Index="80"><![CDATA[level of difficulty is akin to a boxed mix: You toss everything into a bowl, make sure they’re

               well-combined, wrap in foil, and then steam.


                    Best of all, it adjusts to your liking. Substitute chicken eggs for quail eggs for aesthetics,


               throw in chopped nuts for texture and slather on banana ketchup for a slightly sweet flavor—

               embutido, or any type of meatloaf for that matter, can be designed to suit your palate, and it’s

               for these reasons why it deserves prevalence and more credit than it is given.]]></page><page Index="81"><![CDATA[SITUATIONAL ANALYSIS

               Philippinarum. The green mussel or “Tahong” as it is locally known is the only species of

               mussel farmed commercially in some areas in the Philippines. And of course, the Embutido,

               or Embotido, is a Philippine meatloaf made with ground pork and stuffed with hard-boiled eggs

               and sliced ham or various sausages. It is traditionally wrapped in aluminum foil and steamed,

               though it can also be baked. Embutido is commonly prepared during Christmas, fiestas, and

               other special occasions.

               I.  Product Concept

                  Musselicious Embutido are inspired by “tahong” that we buy in the market. Since Tahong


               is one of Tanza's most popular food, we used this to make embutido, but instead of using the

               original ingredient of it which is Ground Pork, we change it and make it musselicious embutido.

               We get this idea by searching first what is the most famous food in Tanza and we discover

               that tahong is included, so we now start to think about what we”re going to do, which is to

               create a one of a kind product using tahong that no one has ever done before, and we arrive


               at  the  conclusion  that  we  could  make  embutido  with  tahong  instead  of  pork.  Additionally,

               Musselicious embutido inspired by those people who loves tahong and embutido, especially
