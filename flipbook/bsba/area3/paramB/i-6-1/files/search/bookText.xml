               Facebook Live.


                       Dubbed  as  “The  New  Normal  of  Online  Business:  Setting,  Starting  and

               Selling”,  the  webinar  were  attended  by  aspirant  online  business  owners  and  other


               participants coming from different sectors and organizations. The webinar served as a

               platform to train the participants on the new normal of online business in terms of setting-


               up, starting and selling.

                       During  the  webinar  about  setting-up  an  online  business,  Ms.  Mary  Joy  Olazo,

               online business owner and  a marketing specialist, shared some guides on how to set-up


               an online store. According to her, the first step is to start with a really great idea by having

               a business or product idea that potential customers will be interested in, and confirmed it


               with market research. They need to be creative and do a little bit of online market research

               to find a suitable product for the online store. The next thing to do is to create an ideal


               business  name.  It  is  time  to determine  how  the  business  will appear to  the  world  by]]></page><page Index="34"><![CDATA[settling on a name for the online business. The name is the biggest decision to make as

               they need to work on their brand, and it’s likely the most important decision since it will


               set the foundation of their business and other decisions to make.  She also mentioned

               that  the  most  important  part  of  setting-up  a  business  is  to  do  a  business  plan.  The


               business plan includes an analysis of the competition and a clear positioning statement

               of where they business fit within the market. It should also include information on  the


               target audience, which the market research should have given them a nice head start on

               collecting.


                       The next resource speaker is Mr. John Daniel Olazo. His talk focused on how to

               start an online business in the new normal. The highlight of his talk focused on choosing


               and building the online platform for the business. For an online business, that platform is

               everything. They need it to look good, be intuitive to navigate, and make a clear case to

               visitors why they should buy. Take time to get it right, and run the finished product by


               some  other  people  (ideally  people  in  their  target  audience)  to  get  feedback.  He  also

               shared that before they launch their business, they should establish a marketing plan.


               Every business is different and marketing isn’t one size fits all. Because they are starting

               an online business, they need to make use of a mix of content marketing, social media


               promotion, and paid search promotion. These will boost their online market presence.

                       The last resource speaker is Mr. Arnel Arnaiz Pioz, a marketing strategist, focused


               his discussion on no cost marketing which is the best tool to market products online. He

               emphasized on his talk that a marketing plan that does not require any costs or expenses


               to be made is called no-cost marketing. This technique is very popular among  online

               businesses. No-cost marketing typically involves curating zero or negligible marketing]]></page><page Index="35"><![CDATA[techniques that can promote your products and create brand awareness. According to

               him, the internet is one of the biggest mediums of this type of marketing strategy.  This


               involves the use of social media which has a plethora of free resources and options that

               can boost your business sales. It is one of the easiest and cost-efficient methods to start


               the marketing journey. One of the biggest advantages of social media platforms is the

               level of engagement and awareness that they can create. Brands can easily build their


               personality  over  social  media  and  target  their  potential  customers.  Mr.  Pios  also

               suggested budget-friendly ads on apps like Facebook, Instagram, and Tiktok that can be


               customized according to their target audience.

                       Indeed, this webinars has provided valuable information on how aspirant online


               business owners can set-up, start and sell in the new normal.
