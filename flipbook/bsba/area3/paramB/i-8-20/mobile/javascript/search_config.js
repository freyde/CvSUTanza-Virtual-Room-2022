Industry Analysis                                A.  Industry features                                   The  food  industry  is  very  large,  and  if  food  production,  manufacturing,                                   marketing, restaurants and institutions are combined, it is the largest industrial                                   enterprise.  An  appreciation  of the  size,  components,  interrelationships, and                                   responsiveness  to  change  of  the  food  industry  enlarges  food  scientists’                                    understanding of the environment in which they operate.                                  B.  Industry Boundaries                                   From  the  word  boundary  itself  which  means  a  border  or  a  limit,  industry                                   boundaries could be defined as the point at which industries ends or beyond                                   which it becomes something else. This means that industry boundaries are the                                   demarcations between two distinct industries, and so it encompasses both the                                    supply and demand trajectories.                                   Understanding  the  industries  and  its  sectors  and  monitoring  the                                   macroeconomic  environment  are  the  two  main  objectives  of  industry                                   boundaries whereby organizational strategies are at the core of the business                                   conduct.                                   C.  Industry Environment                                   Restaurants and other food-service providers are so widespread that half of all                                   adults have worked in food service in one way or another at some point in their                                   lives. The food service industry encompasses any establishment that serves","17                                    food  to  people  outside  their  home.  This  includes  restaurants,  carryout                                   operations, cafeterias, university dining halls, catering and vending companies,                                   hotels and inns, and rehab and retirement centers.                                      This industry is divided into two groups: Those that prepare and serve food and                                   those that produce and distribute food, equipment, and services needed by                                   food providers. The most common example of the first group is restaurants.                                   Restaurants employ front of the house people and back of the house people.                                   The  former  includes  bartenders,  wait  staff,  hosts,  and  busboys.  The  latter                                    includes chefs, cooks, managers, and dishwashers. Fast food restaurants limit                                   their staff to food preparation people, managers, and cashiers. The trend of                                   food trucks adds a mobile component to food service and requires just a few                                   people to drive the truck, cook the food, and serve it through a window.                                  D.  Industry Structure                                   Foodservice establishments are projected to capture 53 percent of consumers’                                    food  expenditures,  whereas  in  1980,  foodservice  captured  less  than  40                                   percent. The foodservice industry accounts for approximately 4 percent of the                                   Gross  Domestic  Product  and  about  11  million  jobs.  It  has  been  rapidly                                   changing  due  to  economic  factors,  technological  advances,  and  labor                                   matters.1 This overview covers many of the issues and trends affecting the                                    different segments of the foodservice supply chain including the foodservice                                   operators,  distributors  and  food  manufacturers.  Changing  customer                                   demographics are a driving force in the evolution of the foodservice industry.                                   As the baby boomers reach middle age, they do not seem to have time to cook                                   and their children and grandchildren do not seem to have the interest, or talent.","18                                   E.  Industry attractiveness                                   Products  will  continue  to  roll  out  to  meet  consumers’  health  and  wellness                                   desires, and plant-based meats will keep making a dent in the market.                                    Food and beverage service is the essential link between the customers and                                   the menu,  beverages  and  other  services  on  offer  in  an  establishment. The                                   server  is  the  main  point  of  contact  between  the  customers  and  the                                   establishment  and  plays  an  important  role  in  a  profession  with  increasing                                   national and international status.

Industry Performance                                   A performance appraisal for customer service expectations is more than simply                                   evaluating employees on whether they greet customers with a smile or whether                                   managers effectively resolve conflicts with suppliers who fail to provide high-                                   quality food products for use in their restaurants. Performance appraisals for                                   customer service in the F\&B world delve deeper into duties such as how to                                    ensure each restaurant patron has an enjoyable dining experience or the ability                                   for  a  bartender  to  take  off  his  mixologist  hat  and  make  the  transition  to                                   psychologist and confidante for a customer who stops in to have a cocktail after                                   a stressful day in the office. Service standards also include the techniques for                                   recommending selections to customers based on questions about customers’                                    preferences, how to approach customers throughout their meal and the timing                                   that wait staff should use when deciding whether to recommend the dessert                                   selections or simply bring the bill.","19                                 G.

And finally, their products                 were originally made in the Philippines.                      The MSE also has its weaknesses. They do not include components like where the firm                 competes.  And  the  products  are  made  only  in  the  Philippines,  but  there  are  some  cities                 where MSE is not popular.","8                          E.

Industry Features                             Features of the shoe industry in the Philippines, the core of which is located in                     Marikina City in the northeast of the Manila Metropolitan Area. Initial discussions delve                     with general remarks on industrial clusters and commodity chains with a detailed account                     of their internal structure and changing fortunes. The deeply-rooted failures of the cluster                     since the early 1990s are pinpointed. These can be directly related to the liberalization of                      the Filipino economy, and the concomitant increase in Chinese-made shoes on domestic                     markets. Various private and public responses to the crisis are described and evaluated.                     It is argued that as helpful as many of these responses may be, their overall impact is                     likely to remain limited. Series of possible policy options and their high risks of failure are                     emphasized.  In  conclusion,  the  study  presents  a  developmental  scenario  based  on                     cluster upgrading and intensified export activity.                     B.
