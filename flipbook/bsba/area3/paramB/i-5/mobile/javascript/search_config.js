CASE ANALYSIS (50 points)          Direction: Answer the case by using the format provided below.                                                  Tesco’s Fresh and Easy                 Tesco is currently the UK’s most successful supermarket with a UK. The company has developed         internationally  over  the  past  10  years  particularly  in  Central  and  Eastern  Europe  and  the  Far  East.         International expansion is a key element of Tesco’s strategic development particularly as opportunities for         further expansion in the UK become increasingly limited.                In February 2006 Tesco announced that it was planning to enter the US retail grocery market. Tesco         planned to invest around $400m per annum, over a five year period, in its US venture. This was estimated to         be sufficient to pay for between 100 and 150 stores in the first year of operation. Tesco undertook detailed         market research including visiting shoppers at home to see what they bought and asking people to keep a         food diary to observe what they consumed. A mock store was built in a warehouse on an industrial estate to         help  develop  the  model  for  the  US  market.  This  had  to  be  kept  secret  to  avoid  competitors  obtaining         knowledge of Tesco’s plans and the stock for the mock store was purchased in the eastern states of America         and shipped to California. The proposed market entry caused a great deal of interest in the USA where Tesco         was expected to raise a serious competitive challenge to existing food retailers including Trader Joe’s, 7-         Eleven, Kroger, Safeway, and Wal-Mart. Tesco thought that 7-Eleven with more than 5000 stores nationwide         and  Trader  Joe’s  (owned  by  the  German  company  Aldi)  with  some  300  branches  would  be  their  major         competitors. Tesco believed that its strategic format would enable it to undercut its main competitor’s prices,         with the exception of Wal-Mart, by between 10% to 25%.                Tesco decided not to open large supermarket style outlets but opted instead to introduce a chain of         low cost convenience stores similar to those operated in the UK under the ‘Tesco Express’ brand. The aim         was to provide a classless retailer capable of operating in both upmarket and deprived areas with Tesco         planning to open stores in so-called ‘food deserts’ (urban areas which had been abandoned by the major US         supermarkets). However, there is a key difference between convenience stores in the USA and the UK. In         the US convenience stores are associated with gas (petrol) stations whereas in the UK they are essentially         self-standing.                Tesco planned to introduce the British model into the USA believing that this would provide an element         of competitive advantage in a highly competitive market where small food retail outlets are relatively unknown.         It was agreed that the first stores would be located on the West Coast of the USA in California, Arizona and         Nevada. Unlike their other international operations it was decided not to use the Tesco brand name. The         stores were to be named ‘Fresh \& Easy’ and referred to as Neighborhood Markets. If the initial stores proved         successful then a move into other areas of the west coast of the USA would take place.                                                                                                     V01-2018-10-01","The first ‘Fresh \& Easy’ store was opened on 8 November 2007 in the town of Hemet east of Los         Angeles with a further four opening in Las Vegas on 14 November. The company planned to open a further         100 outlets in the following 12 months. By mid – July 2008, 71 ‘Fresh \& Easy’ outlets were in business. The         format of the new stores came as something of a surprise to American consumers. The muted green branded         stores are bright and clean with a bias towards fresh and organic foods much of which is pre-packed, a         relatively unusual feature in the USA. Around half of the products are ‘Fresh \& Easy’ ‘own brands’ including         high ‘value-added’ ready meals. This, again, is unusual in America where brands dominate the food retail         scene. First perceptions by some customers at the Hemet store were that prices were relatively high and that         people were ‘looking’ rather than ‘buying’. In addition there are no in-store checkout staff and customers are         required to scan the bar codes on their purchases before paying. This means that many of the products on         sale have to be packaged to carry a barcode which somewhat undermines the company’s environmental         claims.                In February 2008 ‘Fresh \& Easy’ announced that it was moving into northern California with plans to         open 19 stores in and around Sacramento. However, at the same time Piper Jaffray, a major US broker,         suggested that ‘Fresh \& Easy’ was not performing as well as Tesco had expected. This was denied by chief         executive Tim Mason who has been quoted as saying ‘We are very pleased with the performance of all of         our stores. Every single week brings more good news as sales, customer numbers and repeat visits are all         growing.’  In  March  2008  reports  were  emerging  that  ‘Fresh  \&  Easy’  was  performing  badly  with  one         commentator saying that sales targets were being missed by up to 70% as a result of very weak ‘footfall’1.         Tesco  responded  by  saying  that  the  claims  were  untrue  and  that  they  were  bewildered  by  the  report.         However, at the end of March 2008 Tesco announced that it was ‘freezing’ the ‘Fresh\& Easy’ store opening         program for three months to allow the business to ‘settle down’. The store opening program was expected to         resume at the beginning of July 2008 and this did, indeed, happen. However, the expansion plan has slowed         and by 2009 the company will have opened around 60% of its original target.                However, Tesco continued to experience problems because of the financial and economic crisis which         hit the USA in mid-2007 and which has seen consumer expenditure fall dramatically in some parts of the         country. Three of the States (California, Arizona and Nevada) in which Tesco established ‘Fresh \& Easy’         have been the most seriously affected by the economic crisis and this has created fresh problems for the         company. In January 2009, to counter these problems, a range of 98cent products and $1 special offers were         launched along with ‘$6 off’ coupons for customers who spent more than $30 in a single visit. The company         has claimed that the 98c packs increased sales by 11%. This is a competitive strategy which may work in the         current economic climate and some analysts have argued that ‘Fresh \& Easy’ may benefit as shoppers trade         down to lowerpriced stores. Some analysts continue to argue that Tesco’s attempt to enter the US market         has been a failure and that the company should withdraw.                Tesco’s expansion into the USA has not been without its critics. The company’s environmental claims         have come under scrutiny, along with its property strategy, its non-unionisation policy in a relatively strongly         unionised sector of business and its refusal to sign a community benefits agreement. Community benefits         agreements are used by stores in the USA to gain customer loyalty. Tesco, in turn, has countered these         criticisms. Tesco’s Annual Review Statement for 2008 contained the following comment on its American         venture, ‘The early responses of customers to our offer has surpassed our expectations with our research         regularly confirming that they like the quality and freshness of our ranges, as well as the prices and convenient         location of the stores’.

What two main functions does the foreign exchange market serve and why is knowledge of that market                important to the international marketing manager??                11-25.  When  international  marketers  take  their  products  or  services  to  overseas  markets,  they  need  to                consider all cultural elements when investigating the new market. Two of the elements discussed in                the text-book are education and language. Using examples, discuss how these two elements would                affect the way a company markets its product or service in a foreign country.               26-35. Today’s global economy is dominated by three major currency blocs: the US dollar, the Japanese                yen and the European euro.
