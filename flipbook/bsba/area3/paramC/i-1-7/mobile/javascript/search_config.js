Bachelor of Science in Business Management major in Marketing Management. Cavite                        State University-Tanza Campus, Tanza, Cavite. January 2022. Adviser: Ms. Debbie                        Rose B. Fabian.                                This study was conducted to determine the online shopping personality types                         and consumers' buying behavior in Cavite. Specifically, the study aimed to determine                          the demographic profiles of the participants; describe the online shopping personality                         type of consumers; identify the type of buying behavior of online shoppers; determine                         if there is a significant difference between their personality type and buying behavior                         when grouped according to their demographic characteristics.                                The study followed a descriptive design. It was used to describe the online                          shopping personality types of consumers. It was also used to identify online shoppers'                         buying  behavior  and  determine  if  there  is  a  significant  difference  between  their                         personality type and buying behavior when grouped according to their demographic                         characteristics. Furthermore, the researchers used quota sampling to determine the                         number of participants.                                The  data  were  gathered  using  self-administered  survey  questionnaires  that                         were distributed to 200 online shoppers in Cavite.                                     The researchers gathered data from September to December 2021. As a result,                         most  of  the  participants  belonged  to the  age  bracket  of  25-40  years  old  and  were                         female. Also, most of them are employed and have a monthly income ranging from                         10,000 and below.                                Furthermore, researchers gathered data that online shopping personality types                          are  shopping  lovers  and  fun-seekers,  and  consumers'  buying  behavior  is  complex                         buying behavior, dissonance-reducing behavior, and habitual buying behavior. Based                         on the result, there is a significant difference between online shopping personality type,                                                                  xii","which is business users, in terms of age, sex, and monthly income. Meanwhile, there                         is a significant difference between buying behavior in age and employment status. The                         null  hypothesis  formulated  for  this  research  study  was  no  significant  difference                         between their personality types and buying behavior when grouped according to their                          demographic profile. The null hypothesis was rejected.                                Most of the participants belonged to the age bracket of 25-40 years old and                         were female, and most of them were employed and had monthly incomes ranging from                         10,000 and below. The personality types of consumers were fun-seekers, and the type                         of buying behavior of online shoppers was complex buying behavior. Meanwhile, in                          the  significant  difference  between  personality  types  and  buying  behavior  when                         grouped according to their demographic profile, it is shown that age, sex, employment                         status, and monthly income have a significant difference in business users, fearful                         personality  types  and  buying  behavior  have  a  significant  age  difference,  and                         employment status in variety-seeking buying behavior.                                E-retailers  can  use  the  findings  of  this  study  to  allocate  their  marketing                         resources  better  and  create  a  more  successful  marketing  mix  for  each  of  their                          products. Future researchers will use the study as another reference or source if they                         have the  same study  or  are  likely about the  online  shoppers'  personality type  and                         buying behavior. Marketers can collect ideas about the typologies of online shoppers                         and their buying behavior. Also, this study would help the psychologist to understand                         customers' behavior with a high degree of reliability.                                                                                xiii","TABLE OF CONTENTS                                                                                                             Page                      BIOGRAPHICAL DATA………………..…………………………….………...........                               iii                        ACKNOWLEDGMENT……...…………………………………….………................                             vi                       ABSTRACT……………………………………………………………………............                                    xii                       LIST OF TABLES……….……………..………………………………………..........                                xvi                       LIST OF APPENDICES………………………………………………………...........                                xix                       INTRODUCTION…………...…………………………………………………............                                1                              Statement of the Problem…………...….…….……...………....................           3                              Objectives of the Study..………...……….……..…...…….…....................        3                               Hypothesis ……………………………………………………………………                                      4                              Conceptual Framework……………………………...…………..................                   4                              Significance of the Study ….….…………...…..……...……..…….............           5                              Time and Place of the Study………..……….…………...…......................         5                              Scope and Limitation of the Study………….…..…...…….…………........               5                               Definition of Terms……………………………………...…………..............                     6                       REVIEW OF RELATED LITERATURE……………………………………............                            8                               Synthesis of Related Literature and Studies...........................................   28                       METHODOLOGY………………..……………………............................................           29                              Research Design………………………...…………………………..............                        29                               Participants of the Study……...………………………………………..........                    29                              Sampling Technique……...………………………………………................                     29                              Data Gathered............…...……………...…...……….……….....................      30                              Statistical Treatment of Data…….…………...…...……...….……..............         30                        RESULTS AND DISCUSSION…………………………………………..................                         32                                                                      xiv","Reliability Analysis…………………………………………………………..                              32                               Demographic Profile…………………………………………………………                                 33                               Online Shopping Personality of Consumer………………………….……                      34                               Buying Behavior of Online Shopper……………………………………….                         41                                 Significant Difference among their Personality Type, Buying Behavior     45                                  and Demographic Characteristics;……………………………………..

INTRODUCTION                                  Online shopping is an easy solution to the busy life in today's world. There has                         been  a  massive  change  in  customers'  shopping  in  the  past  decade.  Despite                         consumers'  continued  buying  from  a  physical  store,  the  users  or  buyers  feel  very                         convenient  with  online  shopping.  Online  shopping  saves  crucial  time  for  modern                         people because they get so preoccupied that they are unable or reluctant to devote                          much time to shopping.(Rahman, 2018).                                Consumers decide to purchase products through e-commerce. The behaviors                         themselves — identifying a problem or deciding to make a purchase — are based on                         ever-evolving  expectations  and  needs.  And  while  needs  look  different  for  every                         shopper, the new expectations that drive online consumer behavior are entrenched in                         commonality (Wenzl, 2021).                                The extent of involvement in a purchase decision determines consumer buying                          behavior. The most common types of buying behavior are complex buying behavior,                         dissonance-reducing buying behavior, habitual buying behavior, and variety-seeking                         buying behavior (Clootrack, 2021).","2                                 There  are  different  online  shopper  personality  types  or  behavioral                         characteristics  of  shoppers.  It  includes  adventurous  explorers,  shopping  lovers,                         business  users,  fearful  browsers,  shopping  avoiders,  and  fun-seekers.  Each  has                         certain traits, and skillful marketing professionals stress the importance of learning                          each  type  to  design  attractive  shopping  services  for  members  of  every  customer                         segment (Bajaj, 2018).                                Statistics show that only two percent of Filipino netizens have purchased goods                         or services online before the pandemic. Fashion apparel, athletic goods, and footwear                         were the greatest sellers in the pre-COVID era. In the post-COVID age, a new category                          has developed. Personal protection equipment, sanitary supplies, and consumables                         have  all  become  hot  commodities  in  recent  years.  Consumers  have  put  off  non-                         essential purchases due to their time spent at home (Masigan, 2020).                                Because of the growth of e-commerce in the Philippines due to COVID-19,                         consumers  chose  to  buy  essential  and  non-essential  goods  online.  This  research                         describes consumers' personality types and buyers' behavior when they shop online.","3                          Statement of the Problem                                The study aimed to determine the online shopping personality types and their                         buying behavior.

Is there a significant difference between their personality type and buying                                   behavior when grouped according to their demographic characteristics?                         Objectives of the Study                                The study mainly aimed to determine the online shopping personality types                         and their buying behavior.                                 Specifically, the study aimed to:                                1.  determine the demographic profile of the participants in terms of;                                       a.  age;                                       b.  sex;                                       c.  occupation; and                                        d.  monthly income;                                2.   describe the online shopping personality type of consumers;                                3.   identify the type of buying behavior of online shoppers; and                                4.  determine if there is a significant difference between their personality type                                   and  buying  behavior  when  grouped  according  to  their  demographic                                   characteristics;","4                          Hypothesis                                 The  null  hypothesis formulated  for this  research  study  was that there  is  no                         significant  difference  between  their  personality  type  and  buying  behavior  when                         grouped according to their demographic characteristics.

It illustrates how the concept is interrelated to achieve the study's objectives.                         The variables being studied are online shopping personality and their buying behavior                         on  essential  and  non-essential  goods.  According  to  Bajaj  (2018),  there  are  many                         different online shopper personality types or behavioral characteristics of shoppers,                          including adventurous explorers, shopping lovers, business users, fearful browsers,                         shopping avoiders, and fun-seekers.                                The  study's  demographic  characteristics,  age,  sex,  monthly  income,  and                         occupation  were  determined  as  the  type  of  online  shopping  personality  and  their                         buying  behavior.  After  identifying  those  variables,  the  researchers  described  the                         significant difference between online shopping personality type and buying behavior                          when grouped according to their demographic profile.

Also, it will give them valuable insight into the behavioral features of each                         consumer segment and their buying behavior.                                 Furthermore,  future  researchers  will  use  the  study  as  another  reference  or                         source if they have the same study or likely about the online shoppers' personality type                         and  buying  behavior.  This  research  will  give  them  an  idea  about  the typologies  of                         online shoppers and their buying behavior because they are responsible for creating                         an involvement chain between the customer and the product or service offered by the                         company.                          Time and Place of the Study                                The  study  was  conducted  in  Cavite.  The  researcher  gathered  data  from                         September to December 2021.                         Scope and Limitations of the Study                                The study focused on determining the demographic profile of the participants                         in terms of age, sex, occupation, and monthly income, the online shoppers’ personality                          types, and the type of their buying behavior. The online shopping personality types                         under  study  are  adventurous  explorers,  shopping  lovers,  business  users,  fearful                         browsers, shopping avoiders, and fun-seekers. The buying behavior types included                         are complex buying behavior, dissonance-reducing buying behavior, habitual buying                         behavior, and variety-seeking buying behavior.                                The study selected participants from Cavite. The result of the study was limited                         to the responses of consumers buying online.","6                          Definition of Terms                         This section presents the terms that were used in the study:                                Adventurous  explorers believe  online  shopping  is  fun.  They  are  likely  the                         opinion leaders for all things online.                                 Business users use the Internet primarily for business purposes.                                Buying behavior refers to people's decision processes and acts in buying and                         using products.                                Complex buying behavior occurs when the consumer is highly involved with                         the  purchase  and  when  there  are  significant  differences  between  brands.  This                          behavior can be associated with purchasing a new home or a personal computer.                                Dissonance-reducing  buying  behavior occurs  when  a  consumer  buys  an                         easily available product.                                E-commerce refers to a business model that allows companies and individuals                         to buy and sell goods and services over the Internet.                                Fearful browser fears about credit card security, shipping charges, and buying                         products sight unseen were overcome.                                 Fun seekers see the entertainment value on the Internet, but buying things                         online frightens them.                                Habitual buying behavior occurs when consumers buy products that they use                         for their daily routine, they do not put a lot of thought.                                Online shoppers are those who purchase products and services online.                                 Personality is  a  characteristic  way  of  thinking,  feeling,  and  behaving.  It                         embraces moods, attitudes, and opinions and is most clearly expressed in interactions                         with other people.                                Shopping avoiders do not like to wait for products to be shipped to them, and                         they like seeing merchandise in person before buying.                                Shopping  lovers enjoy  buying  online  and  do  so  frequently.  They  are                         competent computer users and will likely continue their shopping habits.","7                                 Variety-seeking buying behavior occurs when consumers might want to try                         out new products just out of curiosity or boredom.","8                                                    REVIEW OF RELATED LITERATURE                                  This  section  contains  different  articles  that  are  used  to  support  the                         conceptualization  of  the  study.  It  also  includes  relevant  studies  that  support  and                          contribute in the development of the study.                         Online Shopping During Pandemic                                In  the  past,  consumers  around  the  world  had  been  more  skeptical  about                         shopping  online;  however,  with  time,  that  sentiment  has  decreased  considerably,                         especially during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.                                  In  2020,  over  80  percent  of  consumers  across  the  globe  shopped  online:                         reaching nearly 90 percent each; the leading regions that year were South America                         and Asia. North America had the lowest share, with just over three in four consumers                         buying  items  on  the  internet.  The  online  store  that  was  used  most  frequently  by                         shoppers worldwide was Amazon.com. Retail e-commerce sales worldwide amounted                         to 4.28 trillion US dollars, and e-retail revenues are projected to grow to 5.4 trillion US                         dollars in 2022. Online shopping is one of the most popular online activities worldwide.                                 According to Campos (n.d.), as cited by Masigan (2020), 91 percent of Filipino                         internet  users  searched  for  goods  and  services  to  purchase  during  the  quarantine                         period. Of all those who searched, 76 percent consummated the transaction. This is a                         clear  indication  that  Filipinos  are  finally  warming  up  to  e-commerce.  From  a  sales                         turnover of $500 million in 2015, e-commerce in the Philippines is seen to top $12                          billion by the year 2025. It already realized $3 billion in 2019. In the first six months of                         2020, growth has already doubled in terms of the number of buyers and the peso value                         of purchases compared to 2019.                                A survey conducted by Global Web (2020) shows that 48 percent of Filipinos                         plan to do more online shopping after the pandemic is over. During the pre-COVID era,                         fashion apparel, sporting goods, and footwear were the best sellers at 54 percent, 18                         percent, and 10 percent of the sales mix. A new category has emerged in the post-","9                          COVID era. Nowadays, essentials that include personal protective equipment, sanitary                         goods, and groceries have emerged as brisk sellers.                                    Time  spent  at  home  has  caused  consumers  to  delay  any  non-essential                         purchases. This has led to pent-up demand. A recent survey indicates that when the                          Filipinos  are  able,  they  will  prioritize  purchasing  clothing  at  19  percent,  home                         appliances and devices at 18 percent, home furniture and accessories at 15 percent,                         electronic gadgets at 15 percent, and smartphones at 11 percent.                                     According  to  a  survey  conducted  by  Rakuten  Insight,  41  percent  of  the                         respondents stated they purchased more online during the COVID-19 pandemic in the                          Philippines as of May 2020. In contrast, only 20 percent said they did not make online                         purchases (Statista Research Department, 2021).                                The pandemic has changed the focus to the top priority of better health. That                         is why consumers' thoughts have changed toward the basic needs, increasing the                         demand for hygiene, staples, and cleaning products while decreasing the order for                         non-essential  categories.  For  the  consumers,  the  top  priority  is  personal  health,                         followed by that of family and friends. Financial security, food, personal safety, and                          medical security are other priorities. People focus on products with health defense                         benefits on beverage and food products, especially those with immunity benefits and                         natural products. Given this is an unpredictable period, we are uncertain about the                         economic future. Thus, many consumers are concentrating on their short-term and                         primary needs. During crises, consumers tend to focus on goods and services at low                          prices, requiring a tangible reason to go for more expensive ones (Bohlen, Carlotti \&                         Mihas, n.d.as cited by Sharma, 2020).                                Due to the sudden outbreak of COVID-19, e-commerce platforms saw a surge                         in their activities as people actively resorted to online buying of the respondents who                         have  purchased  essential  goods  from  online  platforms  mainly  due  to  the  COVID                         outbreak. Groceries and hygiene products were given preference over luxury products                         during  the  pandemic  of  the  population  purchased  groceries  and  59.5  purchased","10                          hygiene products online, while 31 of the population purchased clothing apparel and                         16.8 purchased ready-made food items from various online platforms. Hygiene and                         health were the most important things to be maintained during the pandemic to avoid                         infection. People were seen shifting their online platforms due to scarcity of goods on                          their preferred platforms and trust and hygiene maintenance issues. Respondents will                         be ready to shift the platforms due to scarcity of products, 17 claimed to be loyal to                         their daily online platforms, and 48 were still confused. (Salunke P. 2020)                                According to the study of Laguna (2020), changes in the popularity of searches                         related  to  food  were  observed  during  the  lockdown  period.  People's  interest  in                          restaurants decreased, and interest in recipes and delivery reached huge popularity,                         comparable  or  higher  than  searches  related  to  health  (symptoms  and  spread).                         People's concerns about diet decreased, but the interest in food products like flour,                         bread, fruits, milk, and chicken (related to cooking, baking, and storage conditions)                         increased.                                Geographically,  38  percent  of  all  e-commerce  transactions  occur  in  Metro                         Manila,  nine  percent  in  Cavite  and  Laguna,  six  percent  in  Cebu,  six  percent  in                          Pampanga  and  Bulacan,  three  percent  in  Davao,  and  three  percent  in  Rizal,  two                         percent in Iloilo, and two percent in Batangas. The rest of the regions are too small to                         be categorized. Cash on delivery is still the preferred mode of payment, comprising 67                         percent of all transactions. Credit cards follow this at 24 percent. Paypal has a five                         percent  share  of  payment  transactions,  while  G-Cash  has  a  two  percent  share.  A                          massive  79  percent  of  all  e-commerce  transactions  are  consummated  over  the                         smartphone (Masigan, 2020).                         Demographics Characteristics of Online Shoppers                                The Philippine population of 110.3 million people skews towards a young, tech-                         savvy group of Millennial and Gen Z consumers (the country's average age is 25.7                         years). Unsurprisingly, these consumers are prolific users of the Internet, spending an                         average of 10 hours and 56 minutes2 browsing the Internet each day. Nearly half of","11                          that time—4 hours and 15 minutes—is spent on social media. Like other countries in                         Southeast Asia, the advent of powerful and affordable mobile devices is at the heart of                         this surge of Internet usage among Filipinos. The Philippines has been a mobile-first                         nation since 2014, and this can be seen in Hootsuite, and We Are Social's findings that                          98.5 percent of adult Filipinos use mobile phones of any type. In contrast, only 77.3                         percent have a laptop or desktop computer (Bahasa \& Leong, 2019).                                Filipinos shop online to find products not found locally or in brick-and-mortar                         stores. Social media listening will go a long way towards understanding the unmet                         needs of Filipino online shoppers. (Benedict, 2021)                                 Benedict (2019) reveals that 67 percent (73.91 million) of the country's total                         population of 107.3 million people are active Internet users. 38.88 million. Based on                         the same report, people in the Philippines have purchased a product or service online.                         25 to 34-year-olds, followed by 16 to 24-year-olds, shop at least 3 to 6 times a week.                         These groups are more likely to shop online every day than all the age groups. More                         women (11.5 percent) shop online than men (8.2 percent), even if fewer women have                         credit cards. Cash on Delivery is still the preferred payment method in the Philippines,                          with  71  percent  of  the  Philippines'  population  being  unbanked.  The  increase  in  e-                         commerce adoption was nationwide and not limited to urban areas.                                In terms of demographics, 72 percent of Filipino online shoppers are female,                         while 28 percent are male. Age-wise, 45 percent are between 25 to 35 years old, 22                         percent are between 18 to 24 years old, 16 percent are between 35 to 44 years old,                          and 17 percent are 45 years old or older (Masigan, 2020).                                    According  to  Goldring  and  Azab  (2020),  the  study  compares  differences  in                         market mavens between two generations: the young adult portion of Gen Z, born from                         approximately 1997 through 2012, to their Gen X parents, taken from 1965 through                         1980,  using  a  field  study  of  traits,  shopping  habits,  and  social  media  behaviors.                         Building  on  generational  cohort  theory  conducted  paired  comparisons  across                         generations  and  in  mavens  versus  non-mavens.  They  found  differences  between","12                          mavens  and  non-mavens  related  to  value  consciousness,  marketplace  interfaces,                         status  consumption,  need  for  uniqueness,  and  social  outcomes  decision  making.                         Significant differences were also found between Ganz's and GenX's mavens regarding                         status consumption and social outcomes decision making. We also analyzed social                          media  engagement  by  product  category  and  platform  and  suggested  managerial                         implications.                                According to the study by Kiyuci (2012), the Internet is an essential facilitator                         for humans. Humans use this medium in almost every phase as a shopping medium;                         the Internet attracts humans, attracting researchers. In this research, younger people                          can adopt newer technologies to adapt to the Internet as a shopping tool. It is tried to                         define college of education students' online shopping behavior and online shopping                         activities; research results show that male students are more familiar and have a more                         positive  attitude  than  female  students.  Teacher  students  who  have  more  monthly                         income and have more internet self-efficacy have a positive attitude and intention to                         shop online. Participants with credit cards have no more familiarity and less anxiety                         concerning internet shopping.                          Consumer Typologies                                Consumer typologies classify heterogeneous populations into meaningful and                         distinct subgroups (Lee, Kim, \& Lee, 2013). From a marketing perspective, consumer                         typologies provide a basis for more precise and effective segmentation, targeting, and                         positioning strategies (Yankelovich \& Meer, 2006).                                 According  to  Teodorescu  et  al  (2008),  the  typology  of  buyers  and  buying                         actions  contracts  are  specific  categories  of  consumer  behavior,  determining  group                         buyers and buying actions in classes, to fragment the markets. Market fragmentation                         through buyer typology and/or segmentation is presently characterized by a multitude                         of theoretical approaches and are especially generated by the common practice in the                         respective business. These two concepts are used for the same purpose, the essential                         difference  being  their  starting  point:  the  segmentation  fragments  the  markets  as  a","13                          whole, while the typology of the buyer and of buying actions generate classifications                         starting from individual cases.                                There  are  many  different  online  shopper  personality  types,  or  behavioral                         characteristics of shoppers. Each has certain traits, and skillful marketing professionals                          stress the importance of learning each type in order to design a shopping services that                         are attractive to members of each type or customer segment (Bajaj, 2018). Here are                         some of the online shopping personality types:                                Adventurous explorers.  Adventurous explorers, (30% of online spending)                         are  a  small  segment  that  presents  a  large  opportunity.  They  require  little  special                          attention by Internet vendors because retailers should nurture and cultivate them to be                         online community builders and shopping advocates.                                Shopping  lovers.  Shopping  lovers,  (24%  of  online  spending)  enjoy  buying                         online  and  do  so  frequently.  They  are  competent  computer  users  and  will  likely                         continue their shopping habits. They also spread the word to others about joys of online                         shopping  whenever  they  have  the  opportunity.  They  represent  an  ideal  target  for                         retailers.                                 Business users. Business users, (19% of online spending) are among the                         most computer literate. They use the Internet primarily for business purposes. They                         take a serious interest in what it can do for their professional life. They don’t view online                         shopping as novel and aren’t usually champions of the practice.                                 Fearful browsers. Fearful browsers, (5% of online spending) are on the cusp                         of buying online. They are capable Internet and computer users, spending a good deal                         of time “window shopping.” They could become a significant buying group if their fears                         about credit card security, shipping charges and buying products sight unseen were                          overcome.                                Shopping  avoiders.  Shopping  avoiders,  (3%  of  online  spending)  have  an                         appealing income level, but their values make them a poor target for online retailers.","14                          They  don’t  like  to  wait  for  products  to  be  shipped  to  them  and  they  like  seeing                         merchandise in person before buying. They have online shopping issues that retailers                         will not easily be able to overcome.                                Fun seekers. Fun seekers, (2% of online spending) are the least wealthy and                          least  educated market  segment.  They  see  entertainment value  in  the  Internet,  but                         buying things online frightens them. Although security and privacy issues might be                         overcome, the spending power of the segment suggests that only a marginal long-term                         payback would be possible (Bajaj, 2018).                                According to Bajaj (2018), many consumers (online) have different traits and                          habits. Since every industry dynamic are different, so are the consumer habits.                                Meanwhile, Brophy and Hodge (2021) identified eight types of shoppers on                         physical stores.                                The bargain hunter. Most retailers regularly encounter bargain hunters in their                         shops. Also called discount shoppers, bargain hunters are usually armed with coupons                         or discount codes, know when all of the best sales are, and rarely buy without some                         sort of deal in hand.                                 Whereas some shoppers are looking for something sentimental, the bargain                         hunter’s  purchase  will  be  primarily  determined  by  price  and  a  sense  that  they  are                         saving money. The bargain hunters need sales and deals.                                The browser. Browsing customers, sometimes called wandering customers,                         are shoppers who are not looking for a particular item or to purchase from a specific                          location. They happened to come across your store and are curious as to what you                         have to offer. The browsing customer is motivated to make a purchase based on an                         experience or a connection.                                The showrooming customers. This type of shopping is particularly popular                         among  people  in  the  market  for  furniture,  appliances,  or  other  large,  expensive                         products that are supposed to last. While large companies like Ikea have molded their                         entire  business  model  on  the  show  rooming  customer,  show  rooming  can  be","15                          problematic for small businesses because often, shoppers will view your product only                         to purchase it from another retailer at a lower price. If you can give the show rooming                         customer’s  peace  of  mind  and  simplify  their  shopping  process,  you  will  meet  their                         needs and convert them into an in-store sale.                                 The impulse shoppers. Impulse shoppers make unplanned purchases based                         on items that appeal to them in the moment. I am sure that you have been in line at                         the grocery store or convenience shop and have grabbed a pack of chips at checkout.                         That is an impulse buy. Typically, impulse shopping is often buying small items that                         catch people’s attention.                                 The  mission-driven  shopper.  Mission-driven  buyers  are  on  the  hunt  for                         particular products or are shopping from a list. They are even sometimes called “list                         shoppers” because they so often come with a physical litany of things they want to                         buy. Others have termed them “need-based” and “reluctant” shoppers because, for                         them,  buying  is  driven  strictly  by  need  and  not  because  they  necessarily  enjoy                         shopping.                                The indecisive patron. Indecisive shoppers are looking to make a purchase                          but  are  reluctant  or  hesitant  to  do  so  because  of  price,  information  overload,  or                         insufficient information. I know I ran into this type of shopper all the time at my store.                         They would try things on, but struggle to make a decision and constantly make excuses                         as to why they shouldn’t buy the piece.                                The educated consumer. The educated shopper researches products or a                          store’s  inventory  online,  reads  customer  reviews,  and  scans  general  pricing                         information before visiting the store. They also typically have an idea of what they want                         to buy by the time they make it in.                                The  loyal  customer.  Loyal  customers,  or  regular  customers,  are  every                         retailer’s  favorite.  The  loyal  customer  is  someone  who  visits  your  shop  often  and                         makes regular purchases. You might even know them by name and have a rapport                         with them (Brophy \& Hodge, 2021).","16                                 According  to  Gautam  and  Prasad  (2019),  develops  a  typology  based  upon                         motivations for online shopping. They identified the types of online shoppers labeled                         as  fear  shoppers,  convenience  shoppers,  novice  seekers,  trusted  buyers  and                         traditional  shoppers.  The  fear  shoppers  worried  about  their  security  and  privacy                          concern. The convenience shoppers are more motivated by convenience. The novice                         seekers  are  substantially  more  motivated  by  information  seeking  across  retail                         alternatives. Trusted buyers are moderately motivated by quality and variety seeking.                         The traditional shoppers are more motivated by physical store orientation.                          Consumer Buying Behavior                                Consumer buying behavior refers to consumers' actions taken (both on and                         offline) before buying a product or service. This process may include consulting search                          engines, engaging with social media posts, or various other actions. It is valuable for                         businesses to understand this process because it helps companies better tailor their                         marketing  initiatives  to  the  marketing  efforts  that  have  successfully  influenced                         consumers to buy in the past (JD, TEAM 2020).                                    A consumer's buying decision depends on the products they need to buy. A                         consumer's behavior while buying a coffee is different from while purchasing a car.                          Based on observations, it is clear that more complex and expensive purchases involve                         higher deliberation and many more participants.                                    Consumer  buying  behavior  is  determined  by  the  level  of  involvement  in  a                         purchase decision. The amount of risk involved in purchase also determines the buying                         behavior.  Higher-priced  goods  tend  to  have  a  higher  risk,  thereby  seeking  higher                         involvement in buying decisions. The following are the types of purchasing behavior.                                Complex  buying  behavior.  Complex  buying  behavior  is  encountered                          particularly  when  consumers  are  buying  an  expensive  product.  In  this  infrequent                         transaction, consumers are highly involved in the purchase decision. Consumers will                         research thoroughly before committing to invest.","17                                 Consumer  behaves  very  different  when  buying  an  expensive  product  or  a                         product that is unfamiliar to him. When the risk of buying a product is very high, a                         consumer consults friends, family, and experts before making the decision.                                For  example,  when  a  consumer  is  buying  a  car  for  the first  time,  it’s  a  big                          decision as it involves high economic risk. There is a lot of thought on how it looks,                         how his/her friends and family will react, how will his/her social status change after                         buying the car, and so on.                                In complex buying behavior, the buyer will pass through a learning process. He                         will first develop beliefs about the product, then attitudes, and then making a thoughtful                          purchase choice.                                For  complex  buying  behavior  customers,  marketers  should  have  a  deep                         understanding  of  the  products.  It  is  expected  that  they  help  the  consumer  to                         understand about their product. It is important to create advertising message in a way                         that influences the buyer’s beliefs and attitudes.                                Dissonance-reducing  buying  behavior.  In  dissonance-reducing  buying                         behavior  consumer  involvement  is  very  high.  This  might  be  due  to  high  price  and                          infrequent  purchase.  In  addition,  there  is  a  low  availability  of  choices with  less                         significance differences among brands. In this type, a consumer buys a product that is                         easily available.                                Consumers will be forced to buy goods that do not have too many choices and                         therefore consumers will be left with limited decision making. Based on the products                          available,  time  limitation  or  the  budget  limitation,  consumers  buy  certain  products                         without a lot of research.                                For example, a consumer who is looking for a new collapsible table that can be                         taken for a camping, quickly decides on the product based on few brands available.                         The main criteria here will be the use and the feature of the collapsible table and the                         budget available with him.","18                                 Marketers  should  run  after-sale  service  camps  that  deliver  focused                         messaging.  These campaigns should aim to support consumers and convince them                         to continue with their choice of their brand. These marketing campaigns should focus                         on building repeat purchases and referrals by offering discounts and incentives.                                 Habitual  buying  behavior.  Habitual  buying  behavior is  depicted  when  a                         consumer has low involvement in a purchase decision. In this case the consumer is                         perceiving only a few significant differences between brands.                                When consumers are buying products that they use for their daily routine, they                         do not put a lot of thought. They either buy their favorite brand or the one that they use                          regularly – or the one available in the store or the one that costs the least.                                For example, while a consumer buys a loaf of bread, he tends to buy the brand                         that he is familiar with without actually putting a lot of research and time. Many products                         fit into this category. Everyday use products, such as salt, sugar, biscuits, toilet paper,                         and black pepper all fit into this product category.                                Consumer just go for it and buy it – there is no brand loyalty. Consumers do                         not research or need information regarding purchase of such products.                                 Habitual  buying  behavior  is  influenced  by  radio,  television  and  print  media.                         Moreover, consumers are buying based on brand familiarity. Hence marketers must                         use repetitive advertisements to build brand familiarity. Further to initiate product trial,                         marketers should use tactics like price drop promotions and sales promotions.                                Marketers should attract consumers using visual symbols and imagery in their                          advertising. Consumers can easily remember visual advertisements and can associate                         with a brand.                                Variety  seeking  buying  behavior.  In  variety  seeking  consumer  behavior,                         consumer involvement is low. There are significant differences between brands. Here                         consumers often do a lot of brand switching. The cost of switching products is low, and                         hence  consumers  might  want  to  try  out  new  products  just  out  of  curiosity  or","19                          boredom. Consumers  here,  generally  buy  different  products  not  because  of                         dissatisfaction but mainly with an urge to seek variety.                                For example, a consumer likes to buy a cookie and choose a brand without                         putting much thought to it. Next time, the same consumer might may choose a different                          brand out of a wish for a different taste. Brand switching occurs often and without                         intention.                                Brands have to adopt different strategies for such type of consumer behavior.                         The  market  leader  will  persuade  habitual  buying  behavior  by  influencing  the  shelf                         space. The shelf will display a large number of related but different product versions.                                 Marketers  avoid  out-of-stock  conditions,  sponsor  frequent  advertising,  offer                         lower  prices,  discounts,  deals,  coupons  and  free  samples  to attract consumers.                         (Clootrack, 2021).                         Consumer Buying Behavior towards Online Shopping                                Today’s  online  consumers  have  more  control  and  bargaining  power  than                         consumers  of  conventional  stores  because  the  Internet  offers  more  interaction                         between  customers  and  products/service  providers  and  greater  availability  of                          information  about  products  and  services.  The  Internet  has  fundamentally  changed                         customers’  notions  of  convenience,  speed,  price,  product  information,  and  service                         (Patro, 2018).                                Online  shopping  has  unique  characteristics,  emphasizing  that  the  lack  of                         physical interaction tends to be the critical impediment in online retail sales, followed                          by the privacy of individual information and security of financial transactions over the                         Internet (Esha, Sultana \& Molnar, 2018).                                Consumer attitudes toward online shopping usually been determined by two                          factors; one is trust, and another is perceived benefits. Therefore, trust and perceived                         benefits  seem  to  be  the  critical  conjectures  of  consumer  behavior  toward  online                         shopping (Sultana \& Chakravorty, 2018).","20                          Also, demographic variables such as age, gender, and income level play a facilitating                         role because they influence consumer perception and consumer behavior that drives                         them towards online shopping (Molnar, 2018).                                Huseynov and Yıldırım (2014) emphasized that the lack of physical interaction                          tends to be the critical impediment in online retail sales, followed by the privacy of                         individual  information  and  security  of  financial  transactions  over  the  Internet.                         Demangeot and Broderick (2016) also revealed that perceived ease of use does not                         affect the behavioral pattern but is rather influenced by security and privacy issues. No                         relationship  is  built  between  the  customer  and  the  online  shop  in  the  presence  of                          perceived online risk, even if a customer spent hours on the Internet (Zuroni \& Goh,                         2012).                                Day-by-day tastes, preferences, and choices vary regarding different factors                         such as Internet emergence. However, this development needs more understanding                         of the consumer’s behavior. Consumer behavior research identifies a general model                         of  buying  behavior  that  depicts  the  processes  used  by  consumers  in  making  a                         purchase decision (Vrender, 2016). Those designs are paramount to the marketer as                          they  can  explain  and  predict  consumer  purchase  behavior.  Jarvenpaa  and  Todd                         (1997) proposed a model of general attitude, behavior, and shopping intention towards                         Internet shopping. The design includes several indicators classified into four broad                         categories: product value, quality services offered through the website, the shopping                         experience, and the risk perception of online shopping.                                 Chang, Cheung, and Lai (2016) studied categories of variables that drive online                         shopping activity. In their study, they divided the features into three broad categories.                         Perceived characteristics of the web sale channel are the first one which includes risk,                         online shopping experiences, advantage, service quality, and trust.                                The  second  category  is  a  website  and  product  features:  risk  reduction                         measures, site features, and product characteristics; and the last group is consumer                         characteristics.  Various  features,  demographic  variables,  consumer  shopping","21                          orientations, consumer innovativeness and psychological variables, computer, Internet                         knowledge, and usages drive consumer characteristics. Consumer attitudes toward                         online shopping usually been determined by two factors; one is trust, and another is                         perceived  benefits  (Hoque,  Ali,  \&  Mahfuz,  2016).  Therefore,  trust  and  perceived                          benefits  seem  to  be  the  critical  conjectures  of  consumer  behavior  toward  online                         shopping  (Al-Debei,  Akroush,  \&  Ashouri,  2016;  Hajli,  2017).  Moreover,  information                         quality,  merchandise  attribute,  website  design,  transaction  capability,  payment,                         security/privacy,  delivery,  self-consciousness,  state  of  mind,  the  consumer’s  time                         sense,  and  customer  service  are  strongly  predictive  of  online,  Rahman  Cogent                          Business \& Management (2018).                                Time-saving  and  available  varieties  of  products  are  the  main  grounds  for                         shopping online. All these four factors motivate an online shopper to buy over the                         Internet.  Therefore,  companies  should  design  strategies  and  develop  varieties  of                         products to attract and retain online shoppers. This finding also confirms the findings                         of Gong (2013) and Hoque et al. (2015), where the respondents found to adopt e-                         commerce for its usefulness.                                 According to Kaemingk (2020), like it or not, in the confusing and busy world of                         online  shopping,  people  want  reassurance  before  committing  to  a  purchase.  Your                         potential customers are turning to online review sites to learn all about your service or                         product. Sites like Yelp, Google Maps, and TripAdvisor allow customers to give advice                         or to read past customer experiences directly from the source. How powerful is this                          route to market on customer buying decisions? The answer is very. 91% of 18-34-                         year-olds trust online reviews as much as personal recommendations, and 93% of                         consumers say that online reviews influence their purchase decisions.                                Online reviews give power to the customers to tell their side of the buying story.                         This provides social proof to other potential customers. Social proof is the level of                         credibility that the public offers to a service or product. The more people who use or                         enjoy a product, the more likely others are to follow. Positive public endorsement of a","22                          brand by a celebrity can provide high social proof, directly impacting sales. Likewise,                         a negative review can drive customers away. There’s also evidence to suggest that                         online  reviews  are  the  primary  way  to  choose  where  to  shop  locally.  Nearly  all                         consumers (97%) now use online media when researching products or services in their                          local area.                         Spending Habits                                According to Bump (2021), most consumers were more conscientious about                         purchases  than  before  the  pandemic.  Because  of  this,  most  households  primarily                         budgeted  around  essential  products  and  services.  As  businesses  and  economies                          closed down due to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, consumers also tightened up                         their budgets. When someone is on a tight budget, each dollar they spend has to be                         worth  it.  This means that the  products  or  services  they  buy  have  to  help  them  do                         something essential, solve a common pain point, save them time or money, or fulfill                         other major needs.                                Consumers  sometimes  see  low  prices  as  simply  good  deals.  Shoppers’                         perceptions of a low price depend on what they’re thinking about when deciding to buy                          a product. Younger generations are also more likely to be price conscious and to price                         compare, as over half of those two age segments report they are annoyed when they                         can find products they want for lower prices elsewhere. While 18-29 year olds and 30-                         44 year olds are fairly aligned on getting products at lower prices and getting irrelevant                         offers, the 30-44 year old group is not nearly as sold on finding the best price at the                          expense of finding unique products (Baird, 2019).                                According  to  Glover  (2021),  many  best  practices  and  marketing  tactics                         encourage natural word of mouth, but campaigns — particularly on social media —                         can have the explicit aim of promoting an online business’ social exposure. 92 percent                         of  people  trust  recommendations  from  friends  and  family  over  any  other  type  of                         advertising.  And  that  75  percent  of  people  don’t  believe  adverts,  yet  90%  trust                         suggestions from family and friends and 70 percent trust consumer reviews. Word of","23                          mouth marketing means your brand is being recommended in the most trustworthy                         context possible. And first time browsers are much more likely to take that crucial extra                         step of handing over their payment details.                         Factors that Influence Buying Behavior                             Consumer behavior is influenced by many different factors. A marketer should try                         to understand the factors that influence consumer behavior.                            Psychological factors. Human psychology is a major determinant of consumer                         behavior. These factors are difficult to measure but are powerful enough to influence                         a buying decision. Some of the important psychological factors are:                             Motivation. When a person is motivated enough, it influences the buying behavior                         of  the  person.  A  person  has  many  needs  such  as  the  social  needs,  basic  needs,                         security needs, esteem needs and self-actualization needs. Out of all these needs, the                         basic needs and security needs take a position above all other needs. Hence basic                         needs and security needs have the power to motivate a consumer to buy products and                         services.                            Perception.  Consumer  perception is  a  major  factor  that  influences  consumer                          behavior. It is a process where a customer collects information about a product and                         interprets the information to make a meaningful image about a particular product.                            When  a  customer  sees  advertisements,  promotions,  customer  reviews,  social                         media feedback relating to a product, they develop an impression about the product.                         Hence  consumer  perception  becomes  a  great  influence  on  the  buying  decision  of                          consumers.                            Learning. When a person buys a product, he/she gets to learn something more                         about  the  product.  Learning  comes  over  a  period  of  time  through  experience.  A                         consumer’s learning depends on skills and knowledge. While a skill can be gained                         through practice, knowledge can be acquired only through experience.","24                             Attitudes  and  beliefs.  Consumers  have  certain  attitude  and  beliefs  which                         influence the buying decisions of a consumer. Based on this attitude, the consumer                         behaves in a particular way towards a product.                            Social factors. Humans are social beings and they live around many people who                          influence their buying behavior. Human try to imitate other humans and also wish to                         be socially accepted in the society. Hence their buying behavior is influenced by other                         people around them. These factors are considered as social factors. Some of the social                         factors are:                            Family. Family plays a significant role in shaping the buying behavior of a person.                          A person develops preferences from his childhood by watching family buy products                         and continues to buy the same products even when they grow up.                            Reference groups. Reference group is a group of people with whom a person                         associates  himself. Generally,  all  the  people  in the  reference  group  have  common                         buying behavior and influence each other.                            Roles and status.  A person is influenced by the role that he holds in the society.                         If a person is in a high position, his buying behavior will be influenced largely by his                          status.                            Cultural  factors.  A  group  of  people  are  associated  with  a  set  of  values  and                         ideologies  that  belong  to  a  particular  community.  When  a  person  comes  from  a                         particular community, his/her behavior is highly influenced by the culture relating to                         that particular community. Some of the cultural factors are:                             Culture.  Cultural  factors  have  strong  influence  on  consumer  buyer                         behavior.   Cultural  factors  include  the  basic  values,  needs,  wants,  preferences,                         perceptions, and behaviors that are observed and learned by a consumer from their                         near family members and other important people around them.                            Subculture.  Within  a  cultural  group,  there  exists  many  subcultures.  These                         subcultural groups share the same set of beliefs and values. Subcultures can consist","25                          of  people  from  different  religion,  caste,  geographies  and  nationalities.  These                         subcultures by itself form a customer segment.                            Social class. Each and every society across the globe has form of social class.                         The social class is not just determined by the income, but also other factors such as                          the occupation, family background, education, and residence location. Social class is                         important to predict the consumer behavior.                            Personal  factors.  Factors  that  are  personal  to  the  consumers  influence  their                         buying  behavior.  These  personal  factors  differ  from  person  to  person,  thereby                         producing different perceptions and consumer behavior. Some of the personal factors                          are:                            Age. Age is a major factor that influences buying behavior. The buying choices of                         youth differ from that of middle-aged people. Elderly people have a totally different                         buying  behavior.  Teenagers  will  be  more  interested  in  buying  colorful  clothes  and                         beauty  products.  Middle-aged  are  focused  on  house,  property  and  vehicle  for  the                         family.                            Income. Income has the ability to influence the buying behavior of a person. Higher                          income gives higher purchasing power to consumers. When a consumer has higher                         disposable income, it gives more opportunity for the consumer to spend on luxurious                         products.  Whereas  low-income  or  middle-income  group  consumers  spend  most  of                         their income on basic needs such as groceries and clothes.                            Occupation. Occupation of a consumer influences the buying behavior. A person                          tends to buy things that are appropriate to this/her profession. For example, a doctor                         would buy clothes according to this profession while a professor will have different                         buying pattern.                            Lifestyle.  Lifestyle  is  an  attitude,  and  a  way  in which  an  individual  stay  in  the                         society. The buying behavior is highly influenced by the lifestyle of a consumer. For                         example when a consumer leads a healthy lifestyle, then the products he buys will                         relate to healthy alternatives to junk food.","26                             Economic factors. The consumer buying habits and decisions greatly depend on                         the economic situation of a country or a market. It bear a significant influence on the                         buying decision of a consumer. Some of the important economic factors are:                            Personal income. When a person has a higher disposable income, the purchasing                          power increases simultaneously. Disposable income refers to the money                            Family income. Family income is the total income from all the members of a family.                         When  more  people  are  earning  in  the  family,  there  is  more  income  available  for                         shopping basic needs and luxuries. Higher family income influences the people in the                         family  to  buy  more.  When  there  is  a  surplus  income  available  for  the  family,  the                          tendency is to buy more luxury items which otherwise a person might not have been                         able to buy.                            Consumer credit. When a consumer is offered easy credit to purchase goods, it                         promotes higher spending. Sellers are making it easy for the consumers to avail credit                         in the form of credit cards, easy installments, bank loans, hire purchase, and many                         such  other  credit  options.  When  there  is  higher  credit  available  to  consumers,  the                         purchase of comfort and luxury items increases.                             Liquid assets. Consumers who have liquid assets tend to spend more on comfort                         and luxuries. Liquid assets are those assets, which can be converted into cash very                         easily. Cash in hand, bank savings and securities are some examples of liquid assets.                         When a consumer has higher liquid assets, it gives him more confidence to buy luxury                         goods.                             Savings. A consumer is highly influenced by the amount of savings he/she wishes                         to set aside from his income. If a consumer decided to save more, then his expenditure                         on buying reduces. Whereas if a consumer is interested in saving more, then most of                         his income will go towards buying products. (Clootrack, 2021).                                According to the study of Vidyapeetham (2018), it was identified that the five                         factors, quality product, product price, brand name, product packaging and advertising                         have greater impact on customer buying decision. Consumers go through the rigorous","27                          thought processing making their buying decisions, since there are alternative products                         which compete in the areas close proximity, relatively cheaper price, quality, brand,                         quality and price are one among the strong competing factors in the decision making                         process. When it comes to beauty products, it is even more intense that all the five                          factors play a major role in consumer buying decision. Manufacturers and retailers of                         beauty products must have this thought at the back of their mind as they embark on                         the marketing of their products (Flores \& Castaño 2020).                         Synthesis of Related Literature and Studies                                According to Clootrack (2021), a consumer's buying decision depends on the                          types of products that they need to buy. The behavior of a consumer while buying a                         coffee is a lot different from while purchasing a car. Meanwhile, learning the personality                         type is important for marketers in designing shopping services that are attractive to                         each type (Bajaj, 2018; Teoderescu et al., 2008).                                Because  of  the  pandemic,  Filipinos  have  increased  their  shopping  online                         (Campos,  n.d.  as  cited  by  Masigan,  2020;  Global  Web,  2020;  Statistica  Research                         Department, 2021). This sudden change engaged the researchers to study consumers'                          buying behavior and personality type when buying online.                                In terms of demographics, 72 percent of Filipino online shoppers are female,                         while 28 percent are male. Age-wise, 45 percent are between 25 to 35 years old, 22                         percent are between 18 to 24 years old, 16 percent are between 35 to 44 years old,                         and 17 percent are 45 years old or older (Masigan, 2018). This became the basis of                          the sampling technique used by the researchers as they divided their sample according                         to the age/generation they belonged to. They also wanted to determine if there is a                         significant  difference  in  the  personality  type  and  buying  behavior  in  terms  of  their                         demographic profile.","28                                                           METHODOLOGY                                  This chapter presents the research design and the sampling techniques used                         in  selecting  the  participants  of  the  study.  It  also  presents  the  data  gathering                          procedures, the data analysis and the statistical treatment to be employed to achieve                         the objectives of the study.                         Research Design                                The study used descriptive design. The study focused mainly on describing the                         online shoppers’ personality types and their buying behavior.                          Participants of the Study                                 The participants of the study are online shoppers. The data were gathered                         from the responses of the participants in Cavite.                         Sampling Technique                                The  researchers  used  the  quota  sampling  technique.  A  questionnaire  was                         developed to be used in this study. It is a structured questionnaire made up of several                         statements which will determine the online shoppers in Cavite. Two hundred (200)                          online  shoppers  answered  the  questionnaire.  Before  the  actual  distribution  of  the                         instrument, the developed questionnaire was pre-tested on online shoppers in Cavite.                         They were not part of the study to determine its validity and reliability. Once the validity                         and reliability were established, this was sent to the selected online shoppers in Cavite,                         wherein  35  percent  are  18-24  years  old,  50  percent  are  25-40  years  old,  and  15                          percent are 41-56 years old. Simultaneously, each participant was contacted through                         any communication forms available such as, but not limited to, texts, social media sites,                         and emails.                         Data Gathered                                A  survey  questionnaire  was  developed  to  describe  the  online  shopper's                         typology when buying online.","29                                 Demographic  profile.  The  study  determined  the  participants'  demographic                         profile, such as age, sex, occupation, and monthly income.                                    The online shopping personality type of consumers. The study looked into                         the  different  personalities  of  buyers  when  purchasing  online.  This  section  of  the                          research provided data to determine their online shopping personality.                                    The type of buying behavior of online shoppers. The research work is aimed                         at the different types of purchases made by online buyers. This helped identify the                         purchasing habits of internet shoppers.                         Statistical Treatment of Data                                 To analyze the data in terms of online shoppers' personality and the types of                         their  buying  behavior,  it  used  a  set  of  statements  to  obtain  participant's  degree  of                         agreement  where they would  check five  if they  strongly  agreed;  4  for agree;  3 for                         neither agree or disagree; 2 disagree; and 1 for strongly disagree.                                Demographic profiles of the participants were collected in terms of descriptive                         statistics-frequency counts and ratings.                                 A conversion table using the Likert scale was used to determine the online                          shopping  personality  types  and  consumers'  buying  behavior.  It  was  also  used  to                         measure the online shopping personality types and type of buying behavior.

F-statistics or F-value was used in presenting the test of the difference between                         their personality types and type of buying behavior when grouped according to age,                         sex, employment status, and monthly income.","30                                 P-value was also used to determine whether there was a significant difference                         or no significant difference. If  it is less than or equal to 0.05, there is a significant                         difference, but there is no significant difference if it is greater than 0.05.                                Furthermore,  the  T-statistics  or  T-value  was  used  to  present  the  test  of                          difference in their personality types and type of buying behavior grouped according to                         their  demographic  characteristics.

The data included age, sex, civil status,                         and monthly income.                                Table 4 shows that most of the participants (50%) belonged to the age bracket                         of 25-40 years old and were female (68.50%). Mostly, (89.50%) of the participants are                         employed (47.50%) and have monthly income ranging from Php 10,000 and below.                           Millennials prefer online shopping because it is more convenient in shipping, delivery,                          and price comparison. It allows them to shop from the comfort of their own home or                         office. Women are more enthusiastic about e-commerce and online shopping than                         men,  who  prefer  to  shop  in  physical  stores  (Columbus,  2020).  The majority  of  the                         participants have a job and a steady income that makes it possible to purchase a                         product through online shopping.","33                                 According to the study of Horrigan (2018), he stated that low-income people                         might be expected to benefit most from finding bargains online – something half the                         online population sees as a benefit of using the internet to shop. Certain features of                         online shopping might make using the internet for shopping attractive to low income                          people.                          Table 3.

This means that they believe online shopping is fun, and they                         are likely to become opinion leaders because of their shopping personality.

These  consumers  highly  prefer  online                          shopping because they do not need to get ready and go to the neighborhood market.

Consumers  are  highly  involved  in  purchasing  decisions  and  thoroughly  research                         before  buying  products.  Shopping  online  is  risky  because  the  consumer  will  pass                          through  a  learning  process.  They  will  first  develop  beliefs  about  the  product,  then                         attitudes, and make a thoughtful purchase choice.

It can be said that a business user's personality type has a significant difference                         in  terms  of  age.  This  means  that  the  business  user's  personality  type  may  differ                         according  to  age.  Others  such  as  adventurous,  shopping  lovers,  fearful,  shopping                         avoiders, and fun-seekers have no significant difference when grouped according to                          age. This means that the personality of a business user varies with age because being                         an entrepreneur is dependent on the person who holds it.

Others                         such  as  dissonance-reducing  and  habitual  have  no  significant  difference  when                          grouped according to age.                                This implies that complex buying behavior and variety-seeking behavior have                         a  significant  age  difference.  According  to  Clootrack  (2021),  age  is  a  major  factor                         influencing buying behavior. The buying choices of youth differ from that of middle-                         aged people. Elderly people have different buying behavior. Teenagers will be more                          interested in buying colorful clothes and beauty products. Middle-aged is focused on                         house, property, and vehicle for the family.                         Table 17.

As a result,                         the  study  revealed  a  significant  difference  between  the  business  user  and  fearful                         browsers according to sex.                                This means that the study discovered a significant difference between business                          users. Ward (2019) found that society's positive perception of entrepreneurship has a                         stronger effect on females than males pursuing entrepreneurial activities. Women are                         generally more concerned about their privacy on the web than men. The main concern","46                          that  discourages  women  from  engaging  in  electronic  commerce  is  the  possible                         disclosure of personal information; however, men are willing to accept that risk for the                         earned profit (Bouhnik, 2018). In addition, fearful browsers based on sex have different                         perspectives on online buying. For example, women prefer to buy what they will use                          online, whereas men prefer to see the product before purchasing.                          Table 18.

Summary                                This study was conducted to determine the online shopping personality types                         and consumers' buying behavior in Cavite. Specifically, the study aimed to determine                         the demographic profiles of the participants; describe the online shopping personality                          type of consumers; identify the type of buying behavior of online shoppers; determine                         if there is a significant difference between their personality type and buying behavior                         when grouped according to their demographic characteristics.                                The study followed a descriptive design. It was used to describe the online                         shopping personality types of consumers. It was also used to identify online shoppers'                         buying  behavior  and  determine  if  there  is  a  significant  difference  between  their                         personality type and buying behavior when grouped according to their demographic                          characteristics. Furthermore, the researchers used quota sampling to determine the                         number of participants.                                    The  data  were  gathered  using  self-administered  survey  questionnaires  that                         were distributed to 200 participants' online shoppers in Cavite.                                    The researcher gathered data from September to December 2021. As a result,                          most  of  the  participants  belonged  to the  age  bracket  of  25-40  years  old  and  were                         female. Also, most of them were employed and had a monthly income ranging from                         10,000 and below.                                Furthermore, researchers gathered data that online shopping personality types                         are  shopping  lovers  and  fun-seekers,  and  consumers'  buying  behavior  is  complex                         buying behavior, dissonance-reducing behavior, and habitual buying behavior. Based                         on the result, there is a significant difference between online shopping personality type,","52                          which is business users, in terms of age, sex, and monthly income. Meanwhile, there                         is a significant difference between buying behavior in age and employment status.                         Conclusion                                After the analysis of the results, the following conclusion were drawn:                                 1.  Most of the participants belonged to the age bracket of 25-40 years old and                                   were female. Also, most of them were employed and had monthly incomes                                   ranging from 10,000 and below.                                2.  It is shown in the results that online shoppers are fun-seekers and shopping                                   lovers. Most of the participants strongly agree that they are fun-seekers                                    because they see the entertainment value in the online shop but are careful                                   when buying the product and shopping lovers result as they enjoy shopping                                   online with no regrets.                                3.  The type of buying behavior of online shoppers is complex buying behavior.                                   This means that the consumer is highly involved in the purchase decision,                                   and the consumer will research thoroughly before buying products. They                                   also strongly agree that dissonance-reducing buying behavior means that                                    consumers buy a readily available product and will be forced to buy goods                                   that  do  not  have  many  choices.  Therefore,  consumers  will  be  left  with                                   limited decision-making. Lastly, they strongly agree that they have habitual                                   buying behavior, which means that the consumer is buying products that                                   they use for their daily routine, and they do not put a lot of thought into the                                    product. They tend to buy products that are familiar to them.                                4.  There is a significant difference between business user personality types in                                   terms of age, sex, and monthly income, while fearful browsers' personality                                   types have significant differences according to sex. There is a significant                                   difference  between  the  participants  in  variety-seeking  behavior  when                                   grouped  according  to  age  and  employment  status  in  terms  of  buying","53                                    behavior.  Meanwhile,  there  is  a  highly  significant  difference  in  complex                                   buying behavior according to age.                         Recommendations                                The researcher further recommends the following:                                 1.  Online retailers should ensure that their online shopping process through                                   their website is easy, simple, convenient, and secure for consumers. They                                   should also build a secure platform to prevent cyber hacking, especially for                                   customers who are hesitant to buy online because of security issues.                                2.  This  study  provides  a  foundation  for  future  researchers  in  studying                                    consumer behavior and types of online shoppers. Further research can be                                   possible by increasing the sample size, including a rural population that                                   may reflect the entire scenario of consumer behavior of online shopping in                                   Cavite.  Furthermore,  the  variables  identified  in  this  study  may  not  be                                   sufficient,  and  more  variables  are  to  be  considered  in  future  research.                                   Researchers may also look for factors that influence the online shopping                                   personality types and types of buying behavior.                                 3.  These findings may provide online business entrepreneurs with pertinent                                   information to create and plan marketing strategies that are in line with the                                   online shopping behavior of the consumer considering online shopping is                                   the most popular online activity. To build consumer trust or loyalty, online                                   store sites are advised to make useful features such as price comparison                                    features,  make  online  shop  sites  user-friendly  and  provide  the  latest                                   information, because the utility of online shop sites will foster trust in the                                   minds of consumers.                                4.  The online business should drive clients to pay more attention to product or                                   service  information  research,  promote  the  products  for  customer                                   awareness, and then increase the online shopping experience to boost the                                   online shopper’s acceptance, trust, and loyalty.","54                                                                  REFERENCES                           Almonte et al (2020).
