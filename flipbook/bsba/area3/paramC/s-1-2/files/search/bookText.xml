            I. APPLICATION
            1-10.     Imagine you are the marketing manager for a US manufacturer of disposal
                      diapers.  Your firm is considering entering the Brazilian market. Your CEO
                      believes the adverstising message has been effective in the United States
                      will suffice in Brazil. Outline some possible objections to this. Your CEO
                      also believes that the pricing decision in Brazil can be delegated to local
                      managers. Why might she be wrong?


                      Before they enter at Brazilian Market they need to do some market
                      research first. In able to know If their product would be popular at Brazil.
                      Also it can help their business to have an ideas in order to have a new and
                      good advertisement. Using used advertisement even if it’s effective in US it
                      doesn’t mean it will be successful in Brazil.]]></page><page Index="35"><![CDATA[These are the possible objection if they use the existing advertisement of
                      US in Brazil.
                      1. It can lead to deceptive advertisement.
                      2. Different point of view of two countries.
                      3. Culture inside of advertisement.
                      4. Popularity of using disposal diapers in country.
                      5. There is a chance of violating some International economic institutions
                      and agreements.
                      6. Also you need to consider the Legal environment.
                      7. Language Barrier
                      In the second hand, Pricing decision also can be solve by doing market
                      research, In order to know what is the right price for their items and
                      convert it in price that can be affordable for every Brazilians. Also the CEO
                      is not wrong as long as it is Pricing Manager. In fact having a local
                      manager in one country can be an advantage of a businesses in the
                      reason that they know how pricing works in their country and can lead to
                      profit in their business














            11-20.   You  are  the  marketing  manager  of  a  food  products  company  that  is
                      considering entering the Indian market. The retail system in India tends to
                      be very fragmented. Also, retailers and wholesalers tend to have long term
                      ties  with  Indian  food  companies;  these  ties  make  access  to  distribution
                      channel difficult. What distribution strategy would you advise the
                      company to pursue? Why?
                                                                 5/10
                      I will advise the Selective Distribution in able to know what are the possible
                      good areas to build a business. It can help the company to handle it well
                      because there are few numbers of distributor that can lead to better
                      communication and it can help to build more productive working relationship.
                      Also as a Marketing Manager, I’m going to pursue the company to adopt
                      online selling platform because nowadays most of the transactions on
                      purchasing products are coming from online. Which is more efficient and way
                      faster, also it is more convenient than buying personally at stores.]]></page><page Index="36"><![CDATA[21-30.     You are the assistant to the CEO of a small textile firm that manufactures
                      qualifty, premium priced stylish clothing. The CEO has decided to see what

                      Companies to know what are the possible opportunities awaits in exporting.
                      The Importance of asking the Export Management Companies is to help
                      identify export opportunities. As an Assistant, These are the steps that I will
                      advice to our CEO, first step is we need to gather informations and to do that
                      we are going to Department of Commerce in able to gather information in the
                      matchmaking process. Ask some advices from the other business that are
                      already in exporting. Next, I will suggest to hire some experienced export
                      management company or export consultant to avoid most of the pitfalls. Last
                      is execute all the knowledge that you gain.
