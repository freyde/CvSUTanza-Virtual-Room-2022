Good governance is defined by UNESCAP (n.d.) as the process of decision-making                      and  the  process  by  which  decisions  are  implemented  (or  not  implemented).  It  is  a                     common  knowledge  that  many  of  the  problems  or  struggles  being  faced  by  the                      constituents  can  be  traced  back  to  the  “decisions”  or  “indecisions”  of  its  public                     officials. Looking into the barangay level, good governance is also being expected by                      the government and of the people.                            Daang Amaya I is a barangay in the municipality of Tanza, in the province of                      Cavite. Its population as determined by the 2015 Census was 3,607. This represented                     1.59%  of  the  total  population  of  Tanza..  Daang Amaya II  reported  6,505  was                     determined  by  the  2015  Census.

Its  population  as  determined  by  the                     2015 Census was 3,916. This represented 1.73% of the total population of Tanza.                             Along this line, the Sangguniang Barangay members shall enact ordinances as                     may  be  necessary  to  discharge  the  responsibilities  conferred  upon  it  by  law  or                      ordinance and to promote the general welfare of the inhabitants therein. As such, all                     the  elected  officials  are  expected  to  perform  their  functions  accordingly,  most                      especially considering the interests of all residents through good governance.                            A  barangay  is  the  smallest  administrative  division  in  the  Philippines  it  has                      several powers, duties, and functions. The Punong Barangay is the one who enforce                     all laws and ordinances; maintain public order; ensure the delivery of basic services;                     enforce  laws  and  regulations  relating  to  pollution  control  and  protection  of  the                      environment; adopt measures to prevent and control the proliferation of squatters; and","adopt  measures  to  prevent  and  eradicate  drug  abuse,  child  abuse,  and  juvenile                     delinquency. While the Sangguniang Barangay can enact ordinances; levy taxes and                      other  revenue  measures;  provide  for  construction  and  maintenance  of  barangay                     facilities  and  other  public  works;  regulate  use  of  public  facilities,  including                      waterworks; etc.                            Therefore, this research aim to know what are the the duties and responsibility                      of  public  officials  and  civil  servants  and  exploring  the  consequences  of  lack  or                     absence of good governance on the part of service users.

Officials.                             The barangay, which is the focus of this study, is the basic political unit which                      serves  as  the  primary  planning  and  implementing  unit  of  government  policies.                     Performance  is  equated  with  the  local  government’s  responses  to  the  community’s                      needs,  particularly  the  provision  of  basic  and  essential  public  services.  High                     performance is the result of rational decision-making; optimal use of resources such                      as  funds, personnel,  equipment,  etc.; and the delivery  of basic public services in  a                     timely  and  sustained  manner.  Performance  can  be  assessed  in  terms  of  the  local                     governments’  capabilities  to  respond  to  the  community’s  need  for  basic  essential                      services.  Local  government  performance  is  then  measurable  through  discernible                     improvement in the quality of life of individuals, the society as a whole, and more                      importantly the poor . (Acosta, 1991)                             The concept of corporate social responsibility is a straightforward subject of                      discussion among companies and stakeholders that continued drawing the attention of                     the governance of the companies. This happened as a result of the requirements of the                      members of the community toward the need of businesses to include communities’                     environmental  and  social  problems  into  the  company’s  activity  strategy  since  the                      company’s  interests  are  beyond  making  a  profit  to  only  shareholders,  but  to  both                     stakeholders and shareholders. The companies are expected to be more productive in                      thinking, more especially, on the ways and processes of alleviating and solving the                     needs  of  different  groups  of  stakeholders.  Stakeholders  comprise  employees,                     government, members of the community, Consumers and the owners of businesses                      who have a stake in a company. Moreover, in a competitive business environment,","companies  are  required  to  accommodate  the  interests  of  the  different  stakeholder                     groups, to gain image and reputation. Besides, firms are supposed to be accountable                      and open to the stakeholders. As a result, owners are evaluating companies, financial                     performance and government are evaluating companies’ compliance with the relevant                      legislation (Thi and Pham, 2018                             In  assessing  the  delivery  of  services  in  the  social,  economic,  political,  and                      environmental  sectors,  Functionality  performance  is  used.  In  Functionality                     Performance, the degree of productivity is determined by comparing the actual LGU                      services  against  service  standards  prescribed  by  the  national  government  agencies                     concerned.  On  the  other  hand,  Service  Delivery  Outcome  Assessment  is  used  to                     determine the effect of the services delivered by the LGUs to the citizen’s quality of                      life,  particularly  the  impact  of  the  services  to  the  socioeconomic  conditions  of  the                     residents,  especially  the  poor.  (  World  Academy  of  Science,  Engineering  and                      Technology International Journal of Economics and Management Engineering Vol:2,                     No:10, 2008 )                              According to Haslinda, Alia, and Faizah (2016) corporate social responsibility                     is  the  responsibility  of  companies  to  incorporate  the  economic,  legal,  ethical  and                      philanthropic needs of the community in their business plans at a given time. This                     shows  that  firms  should  offer  some  things  that  communities  need.  Furthermore,                      businesses  might  merely  have  a  means  of  staying  alive  for  a  long  time,  if  they                     accomplish  their  CSR  activities.  Likewise,  the  communities  should  encourage  and                      assist  companies  to  attain  their  economic  goals,  this  would  be  done  through  the                     provision  of  product  safety  and  proper  provision  of  employees’  health  facilities.                     Supplementary communities are anticipating the companies to perform their ethical                      responsibilities, through making their business activities in accord with societal values.","Finally,  voluntary  responsibilities  are  those  social  activities  required  by  the                     communities higher than economic, legal and ethical commitments.                              In the Philippines, through the Department of Interior and Local Government,                     Seal  of  Good  Local  Governance  for  Barangay  Assessment  (SGLGB)  is  one  of  the                      most commonly used performance indicator systems at the barangay level. It is a self                     assessment  LGU  performance  by  measuring  multi  sectorial  impact  and  the                      presence/number of services, facilities, projects, plans, programs, and policies, while                     emphasizing on good governance and administration. The result of the evaluation will                      guide  the  policy  makers  in  making  decisions  towards  the  modification  of  their                     strategies in implementing a program. SGLGB can also be used in the identification                     of Bottlenecks or impediments in the program mechanisms for the purpose of early                      corrective  measures  in  order  not  to  waste  resources  and  energies.  The  system  is                     essential in determining the LGU particularly the barangay its level of functionality                      and  performance  in  order  to  enable  local  leaders  to  improve  the  quality  of  local                     policies,  programs,  and  services  for  greater  transparency  and  accountability  in                      government operations. (DILG, 2001)                             Local governments also have a very crucial role to play in the attainment of                      government goals under the Sustainable Development Goals Declaration. The need to                     encourage local governments to reallocate resources towards basic social services and                      intensify efforts towards the implementation of programs, projects, and activities that                     are responsive to sustainable Development Goals or SDG had been underscored time                      and  again.

Each target has between 1 and 3 indicators used to measure progress toward reaching","the  targets.  The  innovative  strategies  and  tested  approaches  in  promoting  good                     governance  and  pursuing  sustainable  development,  are  now  being  implemented  in                      several Philippine communities. Thus, in keeping with the theme of the campaign, the                     United Nation’s Agenda 2030 and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) pick up                      where  the  Millennium  Development  Goals  (MDGs)  left  off.  The  SDGs  set  forth  a                     formidable task for the global community and international sustainable development                      over  the  next  15  years.  Learning  from  the  successes  and  failures  of  the  MDGs,                     government  officials,  development  experts, and  many other  groups understood that                      localization is necessary to accomplish the SDGs but how and what to localize remain                     as questions to be answered.(Patole,2018)                             Epistemologically,  legitimacy  theory  describes  CSR  activities  conducted  by                      companies  as  a  standard,  ethics,  duties,  and  approaches  to  gaining  a  standard                     legitimacy. Therefore, legitimacy is a process of making the company being suitable,                      sustainable  and  good  to  the  members  of  the  community  as  well  as,  making  the                     companies operate under a socially build system of standards, ethics, and beliefs of                      the society .(Odoemelam and Okafor, 2018)                              One  notable  study  was  that  of  Caldo  (2015)  who  tried  to  link  good                      governance to the competency of the barangay officials. He assessed the competency                     measures  of  the  barangay  council  officials,  and  the  findings  show  that  the  Punong                      Barangay  and  Sangguniang  barangay  members  have  strong  belief  that  they  are                     competent  in  performing  their  duties  and  functions;  but  this  contradicts  to  the                      response of selected residents who said that they are uncertain to the performance of                     their barangay officials.","According to Antal Szerletics (2000), the notion of good governance can be                     conceived as  a basket  of many practices,  including, for example, professional  civil                      service,  anti-corruption  policies,  transparency  and  accountability,  democratic                     decision-making,  the  principle  of  the  rule  of  law,  protection  of  human  rights  and                      independent judiciary. The constitutive elements of good governance vary according                     to the particular international organization and the particular document we examine.                              According to Lipson (1965), Politics involves the fundamentals of social order                     with the formation of groups. Society is a system of groups which are the breeding                      grounds for politics. Good governance can foster public participation in policymaking                     and promote inclusion in decision-making processes. A society that is well governed                     should provide maximum opportunities for every individual to realize his full human                      potential. Thus by practicing  good  governance in a basic political  unit  such as the                     barangay, it can be an effective tool for the promotion of the general welfare of the                      people,  thus  would  serve  as  an  assessment  for  the  performance  of  the  elective                     barangay  officials.  This  inquiry  notes  that  good  governance  of  a  barangay  can  be                      affected by the lack of capabilities of officials; indecisiveness during assumption of                     duties as officers‐in‐charges.","METHODOLOGY                            This chapter presents the methodology of the study.

Daang Amaya l, ll, and lll Tanza                     Cavite. In this study, sex is an individual self-conception as being male and female of                      the respondents. The findings showed that majority of the respondents is female with                     60% and 40% for the male. We found out that the residents are satisfied with what the                      barangay officials have done for them, but there are still a few who are not. We also                     noticed based on our information gathered that almost 35% of the residents disagreed                      with ensuring that their barangay is clean. Another positive information we gathered                     is  that  Brgy.  Daang  Amaya  l,  ll,  and  lll  offer  health-related  services  to  their                     community. Since we have a pandemic, it is important for everyone to prevent the                      spread of the virus. The researchers were pleased with the good results of the survey                     questionnaire  because  only  a  few  were  not  satisfied  with  the  management  of  their                      residence.  Hopefully,  the  results  of  the  study  will  help  other  barangay  officials  of                     Brgy. Daang Amaya l, ll, and lll Tanza Cavite. Since there are still a few residents                      who  are  not  satisfied  to  their  barangay  official,  hopefully  they  will  focus  on  other                     things  in  their  community  such  as  just  keeping  the  community  clean  because  the                      residents  are  not  agree  with    the  cleanliness  of  their  barangay.  In  this  study,  the                     researchers hope that the Brgy. Officials pay attention in the few people who did not                      have a good results of the findings. But for all intents and purposes, l hope the good                     governance of Brgy.
