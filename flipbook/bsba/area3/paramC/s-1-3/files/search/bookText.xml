                       Class Millennials in Tanza, Cavite. Undergraduate Thesis. Bachelor of Science in
                       Business  Management  major  in  Marketing  Management.  Cavite  State  University-
                       Tanza Campus, Tanza, Cavite. January 2022. Adviser: Mr. Ritch M. Banate.

                              The study was conducted to determine the acceptability and usage of cashless

                       payment  systems  among  the  working-class  millennials  in  Tanza,  Cavite.  It  was

                       conducted in Tanza, Cavite from September to January 2022. It specifically aims to;

                       determine the socio-demographic profile of the participants in terms of age, sex, civil


                       status, monthly income, frequency of using cashless payment per week and purpose

                       of  using  cashless  payment;  identify  the  perceived  level  of  acceptance  of  selected

                       working-class millennials towards cashless payment system in terms of benefits, trust,

                       self-efficacy, ease of use and security; determine if the perceived level of acceptance

                       of selected working-class millennials has influence on their usage of cashless payment

                       system; and identify if the profiles of the participants have significant relationship to

                       their perceived level of acceptance and usage of cashless payment system.


                              The  study  used  descriptive-correlation  design  to  collect  data  on  the

                       participants’ socio-demographic profile, perceived level of acceptance and usage of

                       cashless payment among working-class millennials in Tanza, Cavite. The relationship

                       of  demographic  profiles  to  perceived  level  of  acceptance  and  usage  of  cashless

                       payment system among working-class millennials was also described.


                              The data was gathered from the responses of 150 working-class millennials in

                       Tanza, Cavite and who are using cashless payment system. Purposive sampling was

                       used in selecting the participants from Tanza, Cavite.

                              The study revealed that majority of the participants have high acceptability on

                       cashless payment system in terms of benefits, trust, self-efficacy, ease of use and

                       security. On the other hand, their perceived level of acceptance has high influence on

                       their usage of cashless payment system.

                                                        INTRODUCTION



                              The biggest game changer in the field of financial technology came at the start

                       of  the  21st  century  with  the  rise  of  the  internet.  Because  of  these  mobile  money

                       services, consumers were able to do fund transfers and remittances, pay bills, and


                       purchase goods with the use of only their mobile phones. These developments, in turn,

                       were the motivation for the Bangko Sentral ng Pilpinas to issue electronic money or

                       “e-money” regulations as a way of creating an enabling regulatory environment that

                       can support the growth of mobile money services in the country. With the growing

                       young  and  technical  school  savvy  population  and  low  rates  of  monetary  inclusion,

                       these mobile cash services carried the possible to acquaint these segments of the


                       population with a simple and convenient way of digitally storing value and using these

                       funds to perform different payments transactions (Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, 2020).

                              One of the most essential notions nowadays is the cashless transaction. Mobile

                       wallets and electronic payment systems account for about 52 percent of all financial

                       transfers in the Philippines. Cashless transactions are ideal for shopping, bill paying,

                       and financial transaction scheduling from home, workplace, or wherever they have a]]></page><page Index="45"><![CDATA[2



                       smartphone.  It  also  decreases  the  cost  of  producing  and  transporting  cash  notes

                       (Carlos, 2021).

                              As these kinds of transactions enter the modern economy, it does not mean

                       that  there  is  shortage  of  cash.  Rather,  cash  transactions  are  just  reduced  and


                       nowadays  people  have  learned  to  handle  their  money  digitally  with  the  use  of

                       electronics.  Some  millennials  today  prefer  the  rising  applications  such  as  Gcash,

                       PayMaya and many more; regular or day-to-day basis for buying meals at fast foods

                       and restaurants, shopping for clothing, groceries, paying bills; and even buying gas at

                       gas stations.


                              At present, the country is combating the Covid-19 pandemic which has had a

                       purchases to primarily online transactions with the use of cashless payment system.

                       Thus,  this  study  attempted  to  determine  if  the  perceived  level  of  acceptability  of

                       working-class millennials have influence on their usage of cashless payment system.

                                             REVIEW OF RELATED LITERATURE



                              This section covers the review of literature and study related to the cashless

                       payment system: acceptability and usage among the working-class millennials. This


                       also presented a synthesis of other research that supported the objectives of the study.

                       Cashless Payment System

                              Arrival  of  the  new  age,  and  growth  of  technology,  comes  a  new  means  of

                       making  payments.  These  means  are  called  cashless  transactions.  Cashless

                       transaction may be payment method that doesn’t involve physical money. Instead of


                       cold  hard  cash,  it  uses  virtual  money  through  the  use  of  credit  or  debit  cards,  or

                       electronic  wallets  (e-wallets).  This  is  also  done  using  a  method  other  than  actual

                       currency. Cashless transactions are on the rise as a result of developing trends driven

                       by  customer  desire,  convenience,  and  efficiency  in  dealing.  Mobile  wallets,  online

                       payment providers, and near field communication technology (NFC) are all constantly

                       changing  the  way  consumers  trade,  mostly  through  tap-and-go  payment  options

                       (Cristobal et al., 2018).


                              The development of cashless payment instruments is accelerating in tandem

                       with advances in technology and payment system strategies that have lately had a

                       significant influence on the stakeholders involved in the banking system. With the help

                       of  ever-improving  technology,  users  and  non-cash  payment  system  providers  are

                       always seeking alternatives to non-cash payments. Devices that are more effective


                       and safer. Supporting the degree of security provided by cashless transactions entails,

                       it is important for service providers to enhance information transparency, such as by

                       providing  more  information  regarding  fulfillment  or  completion,  as  well  as  privacy

                       protection, account security, technology security, and etc. (Seytano & Sunarjo, 2021).

                              Sumathy & KP (2017), found in their study that it is necessary to move away

                       from  the  cash-based  system  to  cashless  (electronic)  payment  system.  The  results

                       showed  that  it  will  provide  several  advantages  like  it  reduces  the  currency]]></page><page Index="52"><![CDATA[9



                       management cost, tracks every transaction, frequently checks tax avoidance or fraud

                       etc.,  enhances  financial  inclusion  and  progressively  integrate  the  parallel  economy

                       with the mainstream. Furthermore, the usage of mobile wallets crosses the boundaries

                       of big cities and gains popularity in villages also.


                              Consumers have taken interest in payment cards as they reduce risks faced

                       with  carrying  tangible  cash.  As  well  as  this  benefit,  it  is  the  preferred  option  for

                       merchants as it improves operations. The most recent technological advancement into

                       the card payment market is contactless payment. This recent technology works by

                       waving the payment card within 10cm of the contactless reader rather than inserting


                       the payment card into the card reader. The contactless payment card does not require

                       a PIN to be entered or any form of authorization. The adoption of contactless payment

                       cards has been said to reduce the effort and duration of payment whilst also making

                       the process more fun for the customer. An additional cashless payment method that is

                       favored by many includes the use of mobile payments. Mobile payment is defined as

                       a  transaction  processing  within  which  the  payer  uses  mobile  communication

                       techniques  in  conjunction  with  mobile  devices  for  initiation,  authorization  and


                       confirmation of an exchange of financial value in return for goods and services (Davies,

                       2017).

                              Cashless payments can be advantageous to the consumer as it is seen as

                       quick  and  convenient.  Wulandari  et  al.,  (2016),  follows  this  view,  providing  that

                       electronic payment methods can be done quickly as there are no problems faced with


                       the methods such as queues. Digital and technology innovation has a large role in the

                       developing cashless society. There are new and improved ways to make payments

                       that aim to replace the use of physical cash. The innovation of payment systems that

                       involve  advantageous  factors  to  consumers  has  the  chance  to  advance  within  the

                       market of payment habits and procedures. Typically, the digital payment system is

                       transforming economic consumption, with smartphone users increasingly relying on

                       these  applications  for  their  daily  transactions.  As  many  payment  innovators  are]]></page><page Index="53"><![CDATA[10



                       competing in the market, there must be a way to advance by allowing the newest

                       technology  to  adopt  features  that  have  greater  suitability  to  making  the  payment

                       process rapid. Some of the most popular applications include Google Wallet, Apple

                       Pay, Samsung pay, Wechat Pay, Alipay, and so forth. The System Is used not only to


                       transfer  money  between  individuals  but  also  to  pay  salaries,  handbills,  purchasing

                       products and services, and make cross-currency remittances. Non-bank entities have

                       relied on their existing broad consumer bases in areas such as e-commerce to expand

                       into the mobile payment arena. Along with the consumer side, digital payments can be

                       advantageous to the consumer as it is seen as quick and convenient. Nemcova &


                       Dvorak  (2013)  found  that  consumers  have  taken  much  interest  in  the  contactless

                       payment  method  as  it  provides  an  improved  shopping  experience  since  the  new

                       payment  platform  is  faster  and  efficient  service,  it  is  to  encourage  consumers'

                       purchasing behavior. In sum, one key advantage of a digital payment system is that a

                       digital  payment  system  is  generally  part  of  an  ecosystem,  an  ecosystem  that  can

                       continuously  communicate  with  the  user  and  provide  additional,  personalized

                       information.


                              According to the study of Olsen (2011), agreed that a cashless society would

                       lower costs of production and distribution of money, as well as the cashless society,

                       would cut companies ‘costs by narrowing down several staffing levels. The leader of

                       the very first cashless society is Sweden. This is down to financial innovation, and

                       more  importantly,  their  developed  electronic  payment  system.  Sweden  has  been


                       known to dislike cash to such an extent that it would be the one country that could take

                       on negative interest rates (Dalebrant, 2016). Moreover, the vast majority of the Sweden

                       nation's banks have long stopped allowing customers to withdraw or pay in cash over

                       the counter. Sweden has seen the circulation of notes and coins as a percentage of

                       gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  drops  year  after  year,  as  Swedes  make  fewer

                       withdrawals  and  look  to  digital  methods  of  transactions  (Browne,  2018).  They  use

                       digital payment systems on mobile phone applications such as iZettle to make it easier]]></page><page Index="54"><![CDATA[11



                       for  small  business  owners  to  operate  cash-free  (Gosheh,  2018).  Furthermore,  the

                       growth  of  contactless  payments Ireland  is  a  good  example  of just  how  quickly the

                       landscape is changing (Horgan, 2018).

                       Use of Cashless Payment among Working-Class Millennials


                              According to Due.com (2017), eight out of ten millennials reported that they’re

                       going to be able to do all of their shopping and pay their bills online via mobile phone.

                       A  study conducted  by  Linkedin  and  Ipsos  revealed  that  32  percent  of  Millennials

                       fantasize a cashless society where currency will not be needed for transaction. Around

                       67 percent of Millennials want digital budgeting features, together with services like


                       mobile payments, mobile banking, and wealth management. In fact, having these sorts

                       of features where you’ll be able to budget, monitor, and track your spending are major

                       sticking points for Millennials. Since Millennials grew up with a lot of technology than

                       the  previous  generations,  this  should  not  come  as  a  surprise.  They’re  willing  to

                       embrace new technology and challenge the stablished order if it enhances their lives.

                              The millennials have embraced application based mostly monetary services

                       and mobile payment apps. The concept of a mobile phone can be used for monetary


                       services like mobile banking, or mobile payments could charm to millennials who are

                       known to be less concerned about cyber security. They view the phone and also the

                       associated financial apps being developed as tools that permit them get things done

                       quickly  and  simply.  For  millennials  new  technologies  are  approached  without

                       intimidation and with an innate understanding of a way to use them. Smartphones


                       which today also can be used during point-of-sale (POS) transactions as a contactless

                       payment method (Copeland, 2020).

                              Mobile devices have transformed the whole world by a click of a button anything

                       from purchase, payment or transfer can happen. During a survey conducted by Nielsen

                       (2016) identified that millennial and generation X are engaged mobile banking users.

                              According to Krismawintari & Komalasari (2019), that exposed the millennial

                       transaction data are recorded, easy to trace, paperless, more convenient, efficient,

                       faster, attractive promos, and that they are ready to use technology well and compared

                       to  X  generation,  they  prefer  to  use  cash  payments  because  it  is  faster  and  more

                       convenient.  In  every  20-25  years,  different  generations  are  going  to  be  formed


                       (Bozavli,  2016).  Each  generation  has  a  different  perspective,  resulting  in  clashes

                       between the present generation and the previous generation. The current generation

                       lives in an era of globalization, and technology is rapidly developing. Meanwhile, the

                       previous generation lives when globalization has not yet occurred and technology has

                       not yet developed. The existence of this globalization has resulted in many cultures


                       entering.

                              According to the study of Rossya (2021), the current generation is a dynamic

                       generation with high mobility, where they always want to keep up with the times, as

                       well as the development of financial technology or buying and selling transactions so

                       that this will lead to different perspectives in making payments or transactions, the

                       younger  generation  (Z  and  Y)  prefers  non-cash  transactions.  Meanwhile,  the  X

                       generation uses cash transactions more often.


                              According to Wolsztynski (2021), pointed out mobile payments are already the

                       preferred  method  among  millennials  in  China,  India,  and  other  Southeast  Asian

                       countries. This development will also doubtlessly be seen in Germany, albeit with a

                       time  delay.  Also,  millennials  are  keener  to  try  out  mobile,  digitized  services  than

                       previous generations, such as Generation X or Baby Boomers, because they were the


                       first ones to grow up as digital natives. On the other hand, they are in a different stage

                       of their lives in comparison to following generations, such as Generation Z or Alpha.

                       Millennials are well into adulthood, oftentimes having finished studies and establishing

                       their careers. Millennials being slightly younger, with the bulk of them being in their

                       mid-20’s and early 30’s can be a suitable indicator helping to predict how the situation

                       will develop in the short- to mid-term future.]]></page><page Index="56"><![CDATA[13



                       Usage of Cashless Payment System

                              According  to  Chatterjee  &  Bolar  (2018),  different  variables  of  mobile  wallet

                       usage  intention  in  the  Indian  setting  were  discovered.  The  researchers  used  a

                       structured  questionnaire  to  collect  consumer  perceptions  on  their  plans  to  utilize


                       mobile wallets. The researchers used the principal component analysis method and

                       structural equation modeling to assess the study's assumptions. The findings show

                       that mobile wallet users' perceived ease of use, compatibility, perceived behavioral

                       control, and trust have a significant and favorable effect on their intention to use mobile

                       wallets.  The  study  found  that  while  designing  mobile  wallet  apps  for  their  clients,


                       managers and designers should include mental cost components.

                              According to Ramada & Aita (2017), conducted a qualitative study to establish

                       a  conceptual  model  for  investigating  the  perceived  satisfaction  of  mobile  payment

                       users  in  nine  Middle  Eastern  countries.  The  researchers  used  a  mixed  method

                       approach and focus group interviews to investigate Arab consumers' attitudes on the

                       use of mobile payment applications. The findings demonstrate that the quality of mobile

                       payment applications, as well as the experience and expectations of Arab customers,


                       have a significant and positive effect on perceived customer satisfaction. Furthermore,

                       the researchers advised focusing on seven critical key criteria when developing mobile

                       applications with appealing features in order to attract and keep Arab customers.

                              According to Atan & Mei (2021), the results of the study show that consumers’

                       perception of these factors of TAM has an impact on cashless payments. The factors


                       include  the  perceived  usefulness,  perceived  ease  of  use,  perceived risk  and  trust.

                       Based on the results study, most respondents agree that they enjoyed using cashless

                       payment and are willing to use this transaction in the future. Therefore, the intention of

                       respondents  to  use  cashless  payment  transactions  is  very  high.  Also  show  the

                       significant values of perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, perceived risk and

                       trust are below Hence, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, perceived risk

                       and trust individually affect the usage of cashless payment.]]></page><page Index="57"><![CDATA[14



                              According to Aji et al., (2020), the use of e-wallet is the best solution to prevent

                       the risk of transmitting COVID-19. Most studies found that the effect of perceived risk

                       on  intention  is  negative  such  as  in  the  context  of  tourism,  internet  and  online

                       application. However, the results can be different for this study context. In the study,


                       the  upper  the  COVID-19  risk  on  physical  cash  perceived  by  the  individuals,  the

                       stronger the intention to use e-wallets for the payment transaction. It’s also important

                       to  contemplate  those  individual  decisions  in  adopting  an  application  system

                       determined by the perceived usefulness. In other words, perceived usefulness of e-

                       wallets  will  encourage  the  patrons  to  utilize  e-wallets  because  the  anticipation  for


                       COVID-19.

                              According to Teoh et al., (2013), to view the promising growth of payment in

                       Malaysia. The use of payment by the majority of respondents confirms that there is a

                       great potential for future expansion of such payment devices. The challenge is to make

                       sure that it continues to satisfy consumers’ expectations which is able to subsequently

                       cause to its increased adoption and use. Study uses multiple linear regressions; it

                       reveals  that  benefits,  self‐efficacy,  and  ease  of  use  exert  significant  influences  on


                       consumers’ perception towards e‐payment.

                              According  to  the  study  of  Lohana  &  Roy  (2021)  the  result  shows  that

                       demographic  profiles  have  no  relation  to  their  perception  and  usage  of  cashless

                              Millennials  are  “Tech  Savvy”,  who  also  known  for  being  comfortable  with


                       technology. Millennials put their priority on speed, ease, efficiency and convenience in

                       every transaction; these consumers are always in a hurry (Cheng et al., 2018).

                       benefit  from  increased  performance.  User’s  get  benefits  as  a  relative  advantage,

                       where these benefits will reflect the amount of efficiency and performance when using.


                       The  perceived  benefits  may  also  be  described  because  the  level  of  trust  to  use

                              According to Diana & Leon (2020), convenience is one of FinTech’s extrinsic

                       motivations that refers to time and location flexibility, and one of the most important

                       factors of the success of online and mobile services. Convenience refers to time and

                       place  flexibilities  as  the most  important  factor  in  the  success  of  online and  mobile


                       service. Users can obtain convenience and efficiency that previously never existed

                       through  mobile  gadgets,  without  having  to  visit  financial  institutions.  Convenience

                       becomes the main factor in users’ experience in using FinTech. Convenience is the

                       biggest factor perceived by users in terms of the benefits.

                              According  to  the  study  of  Bezhovski  (2016),  cashless  payment  methods


                       provide easy access to payment services anywhere and anytime and the likelihood to

                       avoid making queues to payment centers as it provides contactless payment options.

                       (Fernando et al., 2020), provides less effort in currency operation costs, maintain track

                       of spending, accessible at any time and from any location as long as users are linked

                       to the internet. He also emphasized that cashless payment is moving into the digital

                       grid resulting in a breakthrough mobile wallets and online e-commerce that made life

                       easier over the past few years.


                              Trust. are often defined as confidence within the performance of the providers’

                       system when using electronic payment or electronic receipt services. It’s confidence

                       that the provider encompasses a good system to guard their information, and ensure

                       that an accurate transaction was made. The level of consumer confidence that their

                       cash and personal information will be secure and that all parties won't go against the


                       interests of users is referred to as "trust." In line with Pestek et al., (2011), trust is the

                       key  factor  that  determines  the  success  or  failure  of  Internet-based  operations.  If

                       customers lack trust, transactions won’t occur.

                              According to Zhou (2013), found out that trust provides a subjective guarantee

                       that consumers obtain a positive experience about the ability, honesty and goodwill of

                       mobile payment service providers. That’s if the consumers don't build trust in mobile

                       payment service providers, they can't gain a convincing experience.]]></page><page Index="60"><![CDATA[17



                              According to Yuvaraj & Eveline (2018), results show on their study that most

                       users are confident to use cashless payment on their online purchases as in case of a

                       problem in their transactions, the money can be easily returned without the need of

                       visiting the physical store. Furthermore, the use of cashless payment system is typical


                       to young professionals who relies more on using it for any of their transactions compare

                       on paying in cash.

                              Self-efficacy. It is one of the extensive studies in the perception of ease of use

                       and key concepts of social cognitive theory. Self-efficacy is defined as "an assessment

                       of  the  ability  of  people  to  organize  and  carry  out  the  actions  needed  to  suit  the


                       prospective  situation".  Self-efficacy  influences  people's  behavior  to  perform,

                       measuring  the  effort  needed,  and  measuring  the  time  needed  to  solve  a  problem.

                       Users involved in various types of communication and function media tend to have

                       higher  self-efficacy  when  compared  to  individuals  with  low  self-efficacy.  Therefore,

                       self-efficacy is a finding that will affect the use of the electronic money perspective

                       (Rahim, 2019).

                              According to Ali et al., (2021), self-efficacy affects the adopted behavior, time,


                       and  the  amount  of  effort  given  to  the  task  as  well  as  the  time  given  to  learn  the

                       operational difficulties in the execution of a task. Self-efficacy is a significant factor to

                       measure knowledge, skill, and ability to use a certain technology. It defines perceived

                       self-efficacy as the judgement of consumers’ abilities to use CB technology and found

                       that  self-efficacy  has  an  effect  on  consumers’  anxiety,  which  directly  affects  the


                       perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness.

                              According to the study of Swiecka (2021), participants who have better financial

                       knowledge  with  higher  educational  attainment  tend  to  be  cashless  payment  users

                       rather  than  cash-only  users  for  day-to-day  transactions.  The  studies  on  cashless

                       payment methods also show that participants who have higher educational attainment

                       tend  to  use  cashless  payment  methods  rather  than  cash  because  they  are

                       knowledgeable about the advantages of using it.]]></page><page Index="61"><![CDATA[18



                              Ease of use. As has been stated, ‘perceived ease of use’ is the most influential

                       factor influencing consumer acceptance of cashless payment. For this factor, most of

                       the respondents agree that cashless payment is easy to use and learn. It also provides

                       various payment channels that ease online shopping process and cashless payment


                       have a clear and understandable system and can be proven that cashless payment is

                       easy  to  use  and  more  flexible  enough  to  consumers  to  be  used  in  their  daily  life

                       (Mohamad et al., 2020).

                              One of the concerning factors of a consumer in adopting a new system, in this

                       case  the QR mobile  payment  system,  is  how  easy  the  system  is for  them to  use.


                       Perceived  ease  of  use  is  “the  degree  to  which  an  individual  believes  that  using  a

                       particular system would be free of physical and mental effort.” This factor is considered

                       as one of the largest influencers on the acceptance of new technology. Should an

                       individual think that the new system is easy to use, and it is effortless to understand,

                       learn and use the system, he or she will find the system is worth trying and adopting.

                       Similarly, an individual might refuse to try and adopt a new system if he or she found

                       or thinks that the system is difficult to use, tedious and complex. With regards to mobile


                       payment systems (Mun et al.,2017).

                              According to Bezhovski (2016), found an important aspect of compatibility for

                       users to adopt cashless payment methods is the flexibility of these systems so that

                       they can be easily integrated into their daily lives. Cashless payment methods are

                       found to be most convenient for small payments and expect it to become less complex


                       in the future.

                              Security. A set of procedures and programs to verify the information source.

                       Within  the  context  of mobile  payment  meanwhile,  security  can  be  categorized  into

                       three areas, which are systems security, transaction, and legal (Teoh et al., 2013).

                              Lack of perceived security is one the factors that lead to low rate of mobile

                       payment usage. Nowadays, there are various technologies used in providing high-level

                       of  security  in  mobile  transactions  such  as  cryptography  (Crowe  &  Tavilla,  2012).]]></page><page Index="62"><![CDATA[19



                       Although the security feature of mobile payment systems is on par with other payment

                       systems such as credit cards (Aydin and Burnaz, 2016), the concerns on the perceived

                       security of mobile payment systems create a barrier in the adoption, not the actual

                       security, (Ovum, 2012). Fear of online cyber theft, fraud, and passive confidentiality


                       are the barriers that consumers resist to use the mobile wallet payment (Yang et al.,

                       2012).

                              Despite many benefits in cashless transactions there is a question about the

                       privacy concern. Increasing technological advancement has also increased the level

                       of risks. Because technologies were also being used for negative purposes. Most of


                       the  mobile  payment  systems  collect  the  personal  information  about  the  users  to

                       provide  them  with  offers  and  other  benefits  based  on  the  information  given.  This

                       information can be misused by hackers to steal the personal details of the consumers.

                       There are also malware apps which cause other problems. Sidi, et al., (2013), found

                       that  with  the  education  qualification  the  awareness  level  changes,  for  example

                       consumers with high education background change their password often and create

                       unique password whereas, consumers with low education qualification are not aware


                       of technical measures such as scanning email attachments, reading privacy and policy

                       information.

                              According to Rose, J. et al., (2014), says that millennial generations are less

                       concerned about their privacy than other generations of consumers. It was also found

                       that developed countries are more concerned about privacy than that of developing


                       countries. It is understood that depending on the nature of the consumers the concern

                       for security increases. (Hassan, 2020) reveals confidentiality is extremely essential for

                       cashless  payment  system  due  to  the  possibility  that  hackers  might  get  the  users

                       sensitive details. In cashless payment, a client ought to be allowed to use the payment

                       system after effective verification. The information entered by the customer is not easily

                       accessible to other customers using the cashless payment system. Confidentiality is

                       an  assurance  that  information  is  shared  solely  among  authorized  individuals  or]]></page><page Index="63"><![CDATA[20



                       companies.  Only  an  authorized  receiver  should  be  able  to  acquire  the  encrypted

                       message  so  that  others  cannot  view  its  contents.  It  must  protect  confidential

                       information from any unauthorized person, process, or device.

                       Customer Acceptance on Cashless Payment System


                              According to Tee & Ong (2016), exhibits the study of the adoption of cashless

                       payment to card payment, cheques, telegraphic transfer, and electronic money in five

                       EU countries. The transformation of the current payment method to a total cashless

                       one may not be possible in the near future, but continuous innovation in technologically

                       aided payment systems will certainly expand the society’s accessibility to cashless


                       payment. Although the adoption of one type of cashless payment will affect another

                       type of cashless payment in the short run, the consequences of adopting cashless

                       payment on economic growth can only be significantly observed in the long run. Hence,

                       any policy that promotes cashless payment will not affect the economy immediately.

                              Mobile consumer adoption involves the consumer's propensity to accept and

                       to assimilate new technologies, specifically a mobile wallet in this instance. Mobile

                       consumer  adoption  consists  of  three  variables,  as  derived  from  the  technology


                       acceptance  model,  to  include  perceived  ease  of  use,  perceived  usefulness,  and

                       attitude toward using the mobile wallet. These factors of mobile consumer adoption,

                       while separately important, form the basis for a higher-level construct that aggregately

                       measure the consumer's overall tendency to use the mobile wallet in a way that it will

                       find  useful.  (Amoroso  &  Watanabe,  2012)  evaluated  what  key  influences  affected


                       consumers  to  use  mobile  payments  and  found  that  subjective  security  was  not  a

                       primary driver of mobile payment acceptance. They found that perceived confidentiality

                       of payment details and perceived trustworthiness were strongly correlated. Four key

                       variables  were  found  to  directly  impact  consumer  intention  and  usage  behavior:

                       performance  expectancy,  effort  expectancy,  social  influence,  and  facilitating

                       conditions.]]></page><page Index="64"><![CDATA[21



                              More Filipinos were adopting e-wallet or payment systems than credit cards in

                       2018. Platforms such as GCash and PayMaya are options for Filipinos to do digital

                       financial transactions without physical cash and credit cards (Zoleta, 2021). Additional

                       data also show that more Filipinos are becoming aware of contactless payments and


                       see such services’ benefits. The Visa Consumer Payment Attitudes study revealed

                       that  80  percent  of  respondents  were  aware  of  payment  systems  (Visa,  2019).

                       However, despite the Filipino consumers’ awareness of the benefits of digital payment

                       platforms, the actual number of payment accounts dropped to 8.6 million from 11.4

                       million in 2018, according to the BSP’s Financial Inclusion Survey.


                              According  to  Yang  et  al.,  (2021),  digitalization  has  been  a  major  factor  of

                       consumer’s behavior that has led to new ways of living. With the increasing adoption

                       of online services, electronic payment has become more trustworthy, along with the

                       expansion  of  the  range  of  suppliers  and  the  size  of  their  delivery  networks.  The

                       emergence  of  digitalization  through  the  Internet  has  accelerated  the  flow  of

                       globalization and payment systems from manual to online transactions. This has led

                       to the dependency on electronic money (e-money) usage in performing transactions.


                       To date, digital wallets and online transactions have addressed issues related to cash

                       handling and long-distance transactions. In addition, e-wallets may be recharged by

                       another similar device with money in its wallet using any mode of transaction. Factors

                       that motivated the Indonesian youth to use e-wallet in light of their intention to use an

                       e-wallet  and  adoption  of  an  e-wallet.  Prior  studies  have  probed  the  perceived


                       usefulness,  adoption  of  digitalization  to  perceived  use,  social  influence,  facilitating

                       condition, lifestyle compatibility, perceived trust, and intent towards the adoption of an

                       e-wallet.

                              According to Chawla & Joshi (2020), lifestyle compatibility is defined as the

                       natural alignment of lifestyle choices and value. This aspect of lifestyle compatibility is

                       important to reduce the potential uncertainty of using technology in relation to a user’s]]></page><page Index="65"><![CDATA[22



                       value,  experiences,  lifestyle,  and  preferences.  Accordingly,  lifestyle  compatibility

                       influences  one’s  behavior  and  offers  great  benefits  in  estimating  consumers’

                       behavioral  intention.  Similarly,  Herrero  et  al.,  (2014),  depicted  that  lifestyle

                       compatibility with technology, which is related to prior experience and value, displayed


                       a  direct  impact  on  the  adoption  of  an  e-wallet.  If  consumers  are  accustomed  to

                       interacting  with  apps,  they  will  probably  assume  that  technology  offers  them

                       convenience to purchase a product.

                              As  consumers  begin  trusting  a  system  or  a  service  provider,  they  will

                       continually use the application to purchase products. Hoque & Alam (2018) asserted


                       that knowledge induces the level of trust in the information source. Hence, identifying

                       the opportunity to leverage the existing knowledge of the consumer to build trust can

                       intensify the consumer’s purchase intention. Thus, trust in the information source can

                       significantly affect purchase intention. Sullivan & Kim (2018) noted that repurchase

                       intention in e-commerce may be increased by increasing trust through low perceived

                       risk  that  consumers  gain  from  online  systems.  According  to  Kim  et  al.,  (2017),

                       perceived  trust  (PT)  has  a  crucial  role  in  predicting  one’s  purchase  intention  by


                       reducing perceived risk during the transaction. Therefore, perceived trust towards a

                       mobile payment system is a vital factor in increasing business profits (Wong & Mo,

                       2019).

                              Consumers  believe  that  using  such  a  system  can  fulfil  their  financial  and

                       lifestyle  desires,  besides  increasing  efficiency  in  the  way  they  conduct  various


                       transactions. Moreover, it has been proven to display a positive effect on the intention

                       to use payment in uncertain conditions. This usefulness may add other services to

                       ensure consumers enjoy using e-wallets as an alternative payment, especially to curb

                       the  spread  of  COVID-19.  The  digital  infrastructure  contributes  to  the  information

                       delivery system, thus enhancing the effect of the perceived usefulness of the system

                       on intention to use the technology (Yang et al., 2021).]]></page><page Index="66"><![CDATA[23



                       Perceived Level of Acceptance of Working-class Millennials

                              According to Indrawan et al., (2021), on top of existing strategy of marketing

                       and operating the system, there are specific characteristics of Millennials that can be

                       targeted  by  service  providers  to  increase  effectiveness  of  such  strategy  that,  if


                       followed,  can  increase  the  acceptance  of  e-money  application.  Working-class

                       millennials  are  more  interested  in  the  benefits  they  get  from  using  e-money

                       applications  rather  than  how  (the  ease)  to  use  the  system.  Further,  working-class

                       millennials are also more interested to be involved (to have experience) when making

                       decisions,  especially  in  the  existence  of  risk  involved  with  the  behavior  (using  the


                       system) and thus by only providing them with information about the system would not

                       very much affect their attitude of using the system. Working-class millennials also need

                       the system to be secure and dependable.

                              Pratiwi and Dewi (2018) found out that the working-class millennials’ perceived

                       level of acceptance has high influence on their usage of cashless payment system.

                       The  results  of  his  study  indicated  that  working  millennials’  perception  positively

                       influenced their usage of cashless payment system as more business are offering this


                       payment  option  to  avoid  long  queues  and  for  health  reasons.  Another  reason  that

                       drives the increase use of cashless payment is that it provides hassle-free transaction

                       and payments can be made anytime and anywhere.

                              Several  researchers  have  examined  the  trust  factor  in  using  electronic

                       payments. Trust and social factors are predictors in influencing someone to use e-


                       money (Tello et al., 2018). Trust is an essential factor in improving one's behavior in

                       using technology. The Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT)

                       is  a  theory  in  measuring  a  person's  behavior  in  using  technology  developed  by

                       (Venkatesh et al., 2012). Some empirical research related to the behavior of using

                       electronic money in creating millennials is still minimal. Therefore, this study excludes

                       technology acceptance factors and trust in the use of electronic money.]]></page><page Index="67"><![CDATA[24



                              Performance expectations are individuals who use technology will benefit from

                       increased  performance.  Users  get  benefits  as  a  relative  advantage,  where  these

                       benefits  will  reflect the  level  of  efficiency  and  performance  when  using  technology

                       (Alwahaishi & Snášel, 2013). The perceived benefits can also be described as the level


                       of  trust  to  use  technology  that  will  improve  job  performance.  Explained  that

                       performance  expectations  become  better  factors  for  predicting  consumers  in

                       technology  acceptance  and  influencing  technology  use  behavior.  This  variable  is

                       interpreted  as  extrinsic  motivation,  work  suitability,  and  outcome  expectations  (Yu,

                       2012). Users will intend to use it because they are satisfied with the technology.


                              It was found that effort expectancy was a critical factor in e-wallet acceptance

                       among Generation Y in India (Trivedi, 2016). A mobile wallet in Japan, Mobile Suica,

                       had been carrying and using for several years due to the fact that it did not require any

                       mental effort in adopting it. Early adopters are the second fastest to adopt e-wallets.

                       Early majority refer to those in a dilemma whether or not to adopt e wallets. They need

                       some time to make a decision regarding technology adoption. The majority are unsure

                       about digital wallets. They become involved in using e-wallets only after they have


                       seen other people’ satisfying results from adopting e-wallets. Laggards normally resist

                       using e wallets. They either have no interest in technology or want to preserve their

                       traditional way of payments (Cheng et al., 2018).]]></page><page Index="68"><![CDATA[25



                       Synthesis of Related Literature and Studies

                              This  contains  relevant  literature  that  supported  the  conceptualization  of  the

                       study. It includes a review on some related studies relevant to the assumptions made

                       by the researcher. The content contributes to the concept of the study.


                              The  idea that  a  mobile phone  could  be  used  for financial  services  such  as

                       mobile banking, or mobile payments may appeal to working-class millennials who are

                       known  to  be  less  concerned  about  cyber  security.  They  view  the  phone  and  the

                       associated  financial  apps  being  developed  as  tools  that  let  them  get  things  done

                       quickly and easily (Copeland, 2020).


                              According to Krismawintari & Komalasari (2019), the working-class millennial

                       generation  prefers  to  use  cashless  payments  rather  than  cash  payments  because

                       transaction data are recorded, easy to track, paperless, more convenient, efficient,

                       faster, attractive promos, and they are also able to use technology well. According to

                       Wolsztynski (2021), pointed out mobile payments are already the preferred method

                       among millennials in China, India, and other Southeast Asian countries.

                              According to Teoh et al., (2013), the use of cashless payment by the majority


                       of respondents confirms that there is a great potential for future expansion of such

                       payment devices. They also reveal that benefits, self‐efficacy, and ease of use exert

                       significant influences on consumers’ perception towards e‐payment. Users get benefits

                       as a relative advantage, where these benefits will reflect the level of efficiency and

                       performance  when  using  (Alfanzi  &  Daulay,  2020).  Several  researchers  have


                       examined the trust factor in using electronic payments. Trust and social factors are

                       predictors in influencing someone to use e-money (Tello et al., 2018).

                              Self-efficacy  influences  people's  behavior  to  perform,  measuring  the  effort

                       needed, and measuring the time needed to solve a problem. Users involved in various

                       types of communication and function media tend to have higher self-efficacy when

                       compared to individuals with low self-efficacy. Therefore, self-efficacy is a finding that


                       will affect the use of the electronic money perspective (Rahim, 2019).  Perceived Ease]]></page><page Index="69"><![CDATA[26



                       of  Use  is  the  most  influential  factor  influencing  consumer  acceptance  of  cashless

                       payment. For this factor, most of the respondents agree that cashless payment have

                       a clear and understandable system to be used in their daily life (Mohamad et al., 2020).

                       Although the security feature of mobile payment systems is on par with other payment


                       systems such as credit cards (Aydin and Burnaz, 2016), the concerns on the perceived

                       security of mobile payment systems create a barrier in the adoption, not the actual

                       security, (Ovum, 2012).

                              The  Visa  Consumer  Payment  Attitudes  study  revealed  that  80  percent  of

                       respondents  were  aware  of  payment  systems  (Visa,  2019).  However,  despite  the


                       Filipino consumers’ awareness of the benefits of digital payment platforms, the actual

                       number  of  payment  accounts  dropped  to  8.6  million  from  11.4  million  in  2018,

                       according to the BSP’s Financial Inclusion Survey. These literatures and studies cited

                       are the reason why the researchers attempted to determine the perceived level of

                       acceptability of working-class millennials towards cashless payment system.

                              Mobile wallets and electronic payment systems account for about 52 percent

                       of all financial transfers in the Philippines. Cashless transactions are ideal for shopping,


                       bill paying, and financial transaction scheduling from home, workplace, or wherever

                       they have a smartphone. It also decreases the cost of producing and transporting cash

                       notes  (Carlos,  2021).  The  researchers  used  this  to  determine  if  perceived  level  of

                       acceptability of working-class millennials have influence on their usage of cashless

                       payment system.]]></page><page Index="70"><![CDATA[27


                                                           METHODOLOGY



                              This  chapter  sets  out  the  steps  and  procedures  that  were  followed  in

                       conducting  the  study.  Specifically,  the  chapter  presents  the  procedure  that  was


                       followed  in  selecting  research  subjects,  developing  the  instrument,  collecting  and

                       analyzing data and finally, making sense of data collected.

                       Research Design

                              The research design that was used in this study is a descriptive- correlational

                       research method. The descriptive- correlation method was used to describe the socio-


                       demographic profile of the participants, perceived level of acceptance and usage of

                       cashless payment system. The relationship of profiles to their level of acceptability and

                       usage of cashless payment system was also determine.

                       Participants of the Study

                              The data were gathered from the responses of 150 working-class millennials in

                       Tanza, Cavite who are 25-40 years old and currently using cashless payment system.

                       Sampling Technique


                              The  researchers  used  a  purposive  sampling  technique  in  selecting  the

                       participants from Tanza, Cavite. These selected participants were asked about their

                       age,  employment  status,  and  if  they  used  any  cashless  payment  method  before

                       agreeing to participate in the study. Then the survey questionnaire link was sent to

                       selected  cashless  payment  users.  Each  participant  was  contacted  through  any


                       communication forms available such as, but not limited to, social media sites, and

                       emails. The researchers have found that this approach was the quickest and least

                       expensive technique to get responses from relevant participants.

                       Data Gathered

                              A survey questionnaire was developed for the study that made up of several

                       statements which determined perceived level of acceptability and usage of cashless

                       payment system among working-class millennials in Tanza, Cavite. The questionnaire]]></page><page Index="71"><![CDATA[28



                       has two parts that were answered by the selected 150 participants who are working-

                       millennials and currently using cashless payment system:

                              Socio-demographic profile. This part of the questionnaire includes the age,

                       sex, civil status, monthly income, cashless payment method currently using, frequency


                       of  using  cashless  payment  per  week  and  the  purpose  of  using  cashless  payment

                       system. This information was used to determine the socio-demographic profiles of the

                       participants.

                              Acceptance  and  usage  of  cashless  payment  system.  This  part  of  the

                       questionnaire includes statements to determine the perceived level of acceptability of


                       working-class millennials on cashless payment system in terms of benefits, trust, self-

                       efficacy, ease of use, and security as well as its influence on their usage using the 5-

                       point Likert scale by checking 5 for strongly agree, 4 agree, 3 slightly agree, 2 disagree,

                       and 1 strongly disagree.

                              Prior to the actual distribution of the instrument, the developed questionnaire

                       was pre-tested to selected working-class millennials from Trece Martires City, Cavite

                       who were not part of the study to determine its validity and reliability.  Once the validity


                       and reliability were established, this were sent to the participants in Tanza, Cavite.

                       Simultaneously,  each  participant  was  contacted  through  any  communication  forms

                       available such as, but not limited to, social media sites, and emails.

                              The developed questionnaire was administered to 30 participants, who were

                       not  included  in  the  study,  to  determine  its  internal  consistency  before  it  was


                       administered to the participants.

                              Table  3  presents  the  Cronbach’s  alpha  reliability  coefficients  of  the  scales

                       under study after accounting for the reversely-worked items. Generally, the minimum

                       acceptable requirements of Cronbach’s alpha coefficient should be greater than 0.70

                       (Hair et al., 1998; George & Mallery, 2003) to achieve internal consistency among the

                       test items]]></page><page Index="72"><![CDATA[29



                              The Cronbach’s alpha reliability coefficient of each scale was greater than 0.70.

                       Moreover, the Cronbach’s alpha reliability coefficients for the working-class millennials

                       perceived level of acceptance and usage of cashless payment system reach the basic

                       threshold for reliability.

                       Statistical Treatment of Data


                              Prior to data analysis, the survey questionnaire was evaluated for validity and

                       reliability using Cronbach’s alpha analysis.

                              Data  was  analyzed  using  statistical  tools  such  as  frequency  counts,

                       percentage, means and standard deviation to describe the socio-demographic profiles,

                       perceived level of acceptability and usage of cashless payment system.


                              A  test  of  association  was  used  in  describing  the  relationship  among  socio-

                       demographic profiles, perceived level of acceptability and usage of cashless payment

                       system.

                              The  researchers  used  descriptive-correlation  method  in  determining  the

                       influence of perceived level of acceptability on the usage of cashless payment system

                       among the working-class millennials by means of determining their level of agreement

                       using a 5-point Likert scale. The following conversion scales were used in interpreting


                       the data.

                              Table 1 shows the verbal and descriptive interpretation for perceived level of

                       acceptability of cashless payment system.]]></page><page Index="73"><![CDATA[30

                                                 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION



                              This  chapter  presents  the  findings  of  the  data  as  a  result  of  the  survey

                       conducted. It also presents pertinent information regarding the problem under study.


                       Reliability Analysis

                              The developed questionnaire was administered to 30 participants, who were

                       not  included  in  the  study,  to  determine  its  internal  consistency  before  it  was

                       administered to the participants.

                              Table  3  presents  the  Cronbach’s  alpha  reliability  coefficients  of  the  scales


                       under study after accounting for the reversely-worked items. Generally, the minimum

                       acceptable requirements of Cronbach’s alpha coefficient should be greater than 0.70

                       (Hair et al., 1998; George & Mallery, 2003) to achieve internal consistency among the

                       test items

                              The Cronbach’s alpha reliability coefficient of each scale was greater than 0.70.

                       Therefore, the Cronbach’s alpha reliability coefficients for the working-class millennials

                       perceived level of acceptance and usage of cashless payment system reached the


                       basic threshold for reliability.

                       Socio-demographic Profile

                              The socio-demographic profiles of the participants were collected through the

                       survey questionnaires that were distributed to them. The data included their age, sex,

                       civil  status  monthly  income,  frequency  of  using  cashless  payment  per  week  and


                       purpose of using cashless payment system.

                              Table 4 shows that most of the participants (76.66%) belong to the age bracket

                       of 25-31 years old and are female (58%). Majority, (74.67%) of the participants are

                       single  and  have  monthly  income  ranging  from Php5,000-Php10,000.  Also, most  of

                       them are using cashless payment once a week.

                       of  4.293  was  interpreted  as  excellent  because  the  security  features  of  cashless

                       while the lowest weighted mean of 4.180, which was interpreted as very good, means

                       might get the users sensitive details. In cashless payment, a client ought to be allowed

                       to use the payment system after effective verification. The information entered by the

                       satisfaction.

                              According  to  Raon  et  al.,  (2021),  the  results  of  the  study  showed  that  the

                       influence of the constructs namely perceived risk, trust, security, use of web assurance


                       seals, perceived usefulness, and perceived advantage were inadequate to determine

                       its  relationships  with  the  intention  to  adopt  e-payment  systems  in  the  Philippines.

                       Therefore, the factors used in this study are not the only drivers that would influence

                       customers’ decisions.

                              Pratiwi and Dewi (2018) known that the working-class millennials’ perceived


                       level of acceptance has high influence on their usage of cashless payment system.

                       The  results  of  his  study  indicated  that  operating  millennials’  perception  completely

                       influenced their usage of cashless payment system as a lot of business are giving this

                       payment choice to avoid long queues and for health reasons. Another excuse that

                       drives the rise use of cashless payment is that it provides hassle-free dealing and

                       Relationship of Demographic Profile to Perceived Level of Acceptance on Usage
                       of Cashless Payment System among Working-Class Millennials

                              Table 11 shows the relationship of demographic profile to perceived level of

                       acceptance on usage of cashless payment system among working-class millennials.

                       The result of the study shows that socio-demographic profile of the participants has no

                       significant relation to their perceived level of acceptance.

                              According to the study of Lohana and Roy (2021) who investigated the impact


                       of demographic factors such as sex, age, education, marital status and income on

                       consumer perception and usage on various cashless payment methods in India. The

                       result shows that their demographic profiles have no significant relationship to their

                       perception  and  usage  of  cashless  payment  system.  This  can  be  explained  by  the

                       Covid-19  pandemic  outbreak  where  most  of  the  participants  are  using  cashless

                       payment for their daily purchases and other transactions.


                              Yang et al., (2021), found out that the moderation effect of demographic profile

                       was assessed on the perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, social influence,

                       facilitating condition, lifestyle compatibility and perceived trust with the intention to use

                       cashless payment system. As the result, age factor failed to moderate the relationships

                       between  perceived  usefulness,  perceived  ease  of  use,  social  influence,  facilitating

                       condition, lifestyle compatibility and perceived trust and the intention to use cashless


                       payment system. Sex factor failed also to moderate the relationship of social influence,

                       facilitating  condition  and  perceived  trust  with  the  adaptation  of  cashless  payment

                       acceptability on cashless payment system in terms of benefits, trust, self-efficacy, ease


                       of use and security. On the other hand, their perceived level of acceptance has high

                       usage of cashless payment system.


                       Conclusion

                              After conducting the study, the following conclusions were drawn:

                                  1.  Majority of the participants belong to the age bracket of 25-31 years

                                      old  and  are  female.  Majority  of  them  are  single  and  have  monthly

                                      income  ranging  from  Php5,000-Php10,000.  Also,  most  of  them  are

                                      using cashless payment once a week for bills or utilities payment.

                                  2.  The participants have high acceptability on cashless payment system


                                      in terms of benefits, trust, self-efficacy, ease of use and security. This

                                      means that the  participant  has  good  experience  on  using  cashless

                                      payment system that resulted to their high acceptability.

                                  3.  Working-class  millennials’  perceived  level  of  acceptance  has  high

                                      influence on their usage of cashless payment system. This means that


                                      their positive view on the use of cashless payment system affects their

                                      usage.

                                  4.  Socio-demographic  profile  of  the  participants  has  no  significant

                                      relationship  to  their  perceived  level  of  acceptance  and  usage  of

                                      cashless payment system. This means that their profile has nothing to

                                      do  with  their  acceptability  and  usage  of  cashless  payment  system.]]></page><page Index="89"><![CDATA[46



                                      Thus, the null hypothesis formulated for this research study system

                                      was accepted.

                       Recommendations

                          In order for a country to prosper as a nation, it requires that its leaders observe


                   and practice good governance in the performance of their duties as public officials.

                   Good governance is defined by UNESCAP (n.d.) as the process of decision-making


                   and  the  process  by  which  decisions  are  implemented  (or  not  implemented).  It  is  a

                   common  knowledge  that  many  of  the  problems  or  struggles  being  faced  by  the


                   constituents  can  be  traced  back  to  the  “decisions”  or  “indecisions”  of  its  public

                   officials. Looking into the barangay level, good governance is also being expected by


                   the government and of the people.

                          Daang Amaya I is a barangay in the municipality of Tanza, in the province of


                   Cavite. Its population as determined by the 2015 Census was 3,607. This represented

                   1.59%  of  the  total  population  of  Tanza..  Daang Amaya II  reported  6,505  was

                   determined  by  the  2015  Census.  This  represented  2.88%  of  the  total population of


                   Tanza.  Daang  Amaya III is  a barangay  Tanza.  Its  population  as  determined  by  the

                   2015 Census was 3,916. This represented 1.73% of the total population of Tanza.


                          Along this line, the Sangguniang Barangay members shall enact ordinances as

                   may  be  necessary  to  discharge  the  responsibilities  conferred  upon  it  by  law  or


                   ordinance and to promote the general welfare of the inhabitants therein. As such, all

                   the  elected  officials  are  expected  to  perform  their  functions  accordingly,  most


                   especially considering the interests of all residents through good governance.

                          A  barangay  is  the  smallest  administrative  division  in  the  Philippines  it  has


                   several powers, duties, and functions. The Punong Barangay is the one who enforce

                   all laws and ordinances; maintain public order; ensure the delivery of basic services;

                   enforce  laws  and  regulations  relating  to  pollution  control  and  protection  of  the


                   environment; adopt measures to prevent and control the proliferation of squatters; and]]></page><page Index="129"><![CDATA[adopt  measures  to  prevent  and  eradicate  drug  abuse,  child  abuse,  and  juvenile

                   delinquency. While the Sangguniang Barangay can enact ordinances; levy taxes and


                   other  revenue  measures;  provide  for  construction  and  maintenance  of  barangay

                   facilities  and  other  public  works;  regulate  use  of  public  facilities,  including


                   waterworks; etc.

                          Therefore, this research aim to know what are the the duties and responsibility


                   of  public  officials  and  civil  servants  and  exploring  the  consequences  of  lack  or

                   absence of good governance on the part of service users.


                          Specially  in  today’s  situations  that  we  experience,  in  the  midst  of  global

                   pandemic,and what are those protocols they implemented to serve their people and


                   how did they manage to  balance a good relationship between its community.

                          This section discusses the review of related literature concept and study about


                   Good Governance and Social Responsibility of Brgy. Officials.


                          The barangay, which is the focus of this study, is the basic political unit which


                   serves  as  the  primary  planning  and  implementing  unit  of  government  policies.

                   Performance  is  equated  with  the  local  government’s  responses  to  the  community’s


                   needs,  particularly  the  provision  of  basic  and  essential  public  services.  High

                   performance is the result of rational decision-making; optimal use of resources such


                   as  funds, personnel,  equipment,  etc.; and the delivery  of basic public services in  a

                   timely  and  sustained  manner.  Performance  can  be  assessed  in  terms  of  the  local

                   governments’  capabilities  to  respond  to  the  community’s  need  for  basic  essential


                   services.  Local  government  performance  is  then  measurable  through  discernible

                   improvement in the quality of life of individuals, the society as a whole, and more


                   importantly the poor . (Acosta, 1991)


                          The concept of corporate social responsibility is a straightforward subject of


                   discussion among companies and stakeholders that continued drawing the attention of

                   the governance of the companies. This happened as a result of the requirements of the


                   members of the community toward the need of businesses to include communities’

                   environmental  and  social  problems  into  the  company’s  activity  strategy  since  the


                   company’s  interests  are  beyond  making  a  profit  to  only  shareholders,  but  to  both

                   stakeholders and shareholders. The companies are expected to be more productive in


                   thinking, more especially, on the ways and processes of alleviating and solving the

                   needs  of  different  groups  of  stakeholders.  Stakeholders  comprise  employees,

                   government, members of the community, Consumers and the owners of businesses


                   who have a stake in a company. Moreover, in a competitive business environment,]]></page><page Index="134"><![CDATA[companies  are  required  to  accommodate  the  interests  of  the  different  stakeholder

                   groups, to gain image and reputation. Besides, firms are supposed to be accountable


                   and open to the stakeholders. As a result, owners are evaluating companies, financial

                   performance and government are evaluating companies’ compliance with the relevant


                   legislation (Thi and Pham, 2018


                          In  assessing  the  delivery  of  services  in  the  social,  economic,  political,  and


                   environmental  sectors,  Functionality  performance  is  used.  In  Functionality

                   Performance, the degree of productivity is determined by comparing the actual LGU


                   services  against  service  standards  prescribed  by  the  national  government  agencies

                   concerned.  On  the  other  hand,  Service  Delivery  Outcome  Assessment  is  used  to

                   determine the effect of the services delivered by the LGUs to the citizen’s quality of


                   life,  particularly  the  impact  of  the  services  to  the  socioeconomic  conditions  of  the

                   residents,  especially  the  poor.  (  World  Academy  of  Science,  Engineering  and


                   Technology International Journal of Economics and Management Engineering Vol:2,

                          According to Haslinda, Alia, and Faizah (2016) corporate social responsibility

                   is  the  responsibility  of  companies  to  incorporate  the  economic,  legal,  ethical  and


                   philanthropic needs of the community in their business plans at a given time. This

                   shows  that  firms  should  offer  some  things  that  communities  need.  Furthermore,


                   businesses  might  merely  have  a  means  of  staying  alive  for  a  long  time,  if  they

                   accomplish  their  CSR  activities.  Likewise,  the  communities  should  encourage  and


                   assist  companies  to  attain  their  economic  goals,  this  would  be  done  through  the

                   provision  of  product  safety  and  proper  provision  of  employees’  health  facilities.

                   Supplementary communities are anticipating the companies to perform their ethical


                   responsibilities, through making their business activities in accord with societal values.]]></page><page Index="135"><![CDATA[Finally,  voluntary  responsibilities  are  those  social  activities  required  by  the

                          In the Philippines, through the Department of Interior and Local Government,

                   Seal  of  Good  Local  Governance  for  Barangay  Assessment  (SGLGB)  is  one  of  the


                   most commonly used performance indicator systems at the barangay level. It is a self

                   assessment  LGU  performance  by  measuring  multi  sectorial  impact  and  the


                   presence/number of services, facilities, projects, plans, programs, and policies, while

                   emphasizing on good governance and administration. The result of the evaluation will


                   guide  the  policy  makers  in  making  decisions  towards  the  modification  of  their

                   strategies in implementing a program. SGLGB can also be used in the identification

                   of Bottlenecks or impediments in the program mechanisms for the purpose of early


                   corrective  measures  in  order  not  to  waste  resources  and  energies.  The  system  is

                   essential in determining the LGU particularly the barangay its level of functionality


                   and  performance  in  order  to  enable  local  leaders  to  improve  the  quality  of  local

                   policies,  programs,  and  services  for  greater  transparency  and  accountability  in


                   government operations. (DILG, 2001)


                          Local governments also have a very crucial role to play in the attainment of


                   government goals under the Sustainable Development Goals Declaration. The need to

                   encourage local governments to reallocate resources towards basic social services and


                   intensify efforts towards the implementation of programs, projects, and activities that

                   are responsive to sustainable Development Goals or SDG had been underscored time

                   Each target has between 1 and 3 indicators used to measure progress toward reaching]]></page><page Index="136"><![CDATA[the  targets.  The  innovative  strategies  and  tested  approaches  in  promoting  good

                   governance  and  pursuing  sustainable  development,  are  now  being  implemented  in


                   several Philippine communities. Thus, in keeping with the theme of the campaign, the

                   United Nation’s Agenda 2030 and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) pick up


                   where  the  Millennium  Development  Goals  (MDGs)  left  off.  The  SDGs  set  forth  a

                   formidable task for the global community and international sustainable development


                   over  the  next  15  years.  Learning  from  the  successes  and  failures  of  the  MDGs,

                   government  officials,  development  experts, and  many other  groups understood that


                   localization is necessary to accomplish the SDGs but how and what to localize remain

                   as questions to be answered.(Patole,2018)


                          Epistemologically,  legitimacy  theory  describes  CSR  activities  conducted  by


                   companies  as  a  standard,  ethics,  duties,  and  approaches  to  gaining  a  standard

                   legitimacy. Therefore, legitimacy is a process of making the company being suitable,


                   sustainable  and  good  to  the  members  of  the  community  as  well  as,  making  the

                   companies operate under a socially build system of standards, ethics, and beliefs of


                   the society .(Odoemelam and Okafor, 2018)


                           One  notable  study  was  that  of  Caldo  (2015)  who  tried  to  link  good


                   governance to the competency of the barangay officials. He assessed the competency

                   measures  of  the  barangay  council  officials,  and  the  findings  show  that  the  Punong


                   Barangay  and  Sangguniang  barangay  members  have  strong  belief  that  they  are

                   competent  in  performing  their  duties  and  functions;  but  this  contradicts  to  the


                   response of selected residents who said that they are uncertain to the performance of

                   their barangay officials.]]></page><page Index="137"><![CDATA[According to Antal Szerletics (2000), the notion of good governance can be

                   conceived as  a basket  of many practices,  including, for example, professional  civil


                   service,  anti-corruption  policies,  transparency  and  accountability,  democratic

                   decision-making,  the  principle  of  the  rule  of  law,  protection  of  human  rights  and


                   independent judiciary. The constitutive elements of good governance vary according

                   to the particular international organization and the particular document we examine.



                          According to Lipson (1965), Politics involves the fundamentals of social order

                   with the formation of groups. Society is a system of groups which are the breeding


                   grounds for politics. Good governance can foster public participation in policymaking

                   and promote inclusion in decision-making processes. A society that is well governed

                   should provide maximum opportunities for every individual to realize his full human


                   potential. Thus by practicing  good  governance in a basic political  unit  such as the

                   barangay, it can be an effective tool for the promotion of the general welfare of the


                   people,  thus  would  serve  as  an  assessment  for  the  performance  of  the  elective

                   barangay  officials.  This  inquiry  notes  that  good  governance  of  a  barangay  can  be


                   affected by the lack of capabilities of officials; indecisiveness during assumption of

                   duties as officers‐in‐charges.]]></page><page Index="138"><![CDATA[METHODOLOGY

                   SUMMARY


                   Based on the results of the study, the following are the data we gathered:

                          We gathered information on 20 respondents, 75% were residents and 25% were


                   belong to barangay officials in the area of Brgy. Daang Amaya l, ll, and lll Tanza

                   Cavite. In this study, sex is an individual self-conception as being male and female of


                   the respondents. The findings showed that majority of the respondents is female with

                   60% and 40% for the male. We found out that the residents are satisfied with what the


                   barangay officials have done for them, but there are still a few who are not. We also

                   noticed based on our information gathered that almost 35% of the residents disagreed


                   with ensuring that their barangay is clean. Another positive information we gathered

                   is  that  Brgy.  Daang  Amaya  l,  ll,  and  lll  offer  health-related  services  to  their

                   community. Since we have a pandemic, it is important for everyone to prevent the


                   spread of the virus. The researchers were pleased with the good results of the survey

                   questionnaire  because  only  a  few  were  not  satisfied  with  the  management  of  their


                   residence.  Hopefully,  the  results  of  the  study  will  help  other  barangay  officials  of

                   Brgy. Daang Amaya l, ll, and lll Tanza Cavite. Since there are still a few residents


                   who  are  not  satisfied  to  their  barangay  official,  hopefully  they  will  focus  on  other

                   things  in  their  community  such  as  just  keeping  the  community  clean  because  the


                   residents  are  not  agree  with    the  cleanliness  of  their  barangay.  In  this  study,  the

                   researchers hope that the Brgy. Officials pay attention in the few people who did not


                   have a good results of the findings. But for all intents and purposes, l hope the good

                   governance of Brgy. Officials in their community will continue so that their residents

                   will continue to support them.]]></page><page Index="151"><![CDATA[CONCLUSION

                   After conducting the study, the following conclusions were drawn:


                       1.  The demographic profile shows that most of the participants are female and

                          belong to the age group of 18-30 years old. And also most of them have 1000-


                          4999 monthly income.

                       2.  The duties of public officials and civil servants towards good governance is by


                          maintaining  peace  and  order.  Also,  by  providing  facilities  and  services  that

                          can help to improve and make their community better.


                       3.  The consequences of the lack or absence of good governance is having a poor

                          economic growth. The service users whose not satisfied with the service and


                          management of barangay officials might not vote them again or might move to

                          another barangay or community.

                   RECOMMENDATION


                          Based on the conclusion drawn, the researchers humbly presents  the following

                   recommendation:


                       1.  To the public official/servants, fulfill your duties and obligations so that your

                          barangay or community  have a good governance.


                       2.  To the residents, be responsible and follow the laws made by your barangay

                          officials to avoid troubles and problems.


                       3.  To  the  future  researchers,  broaden  the  study  and  expand  the  knowledge  or

                          information so that you can conduct better results.]]></page><page Index="152"><![CDATA[REFERENCES

               Product Overview

                   I.     PRODUCT CONCEPT]]></page><page Index="162"><![CDATA[Tinapa  (smoked  fish)  is  a  favorite  and  is  definitely  popular  among  Filipinos.  This  food  is

               offered by street vendors all across the Philippines.



                       Tinapa  fish  is  cooked  fish  that  has  been  manually  decayed  by  pounding,  grinding,

               pressing, mincing, mixing, and/or sieving until it achieves the consistency of a paste. Shellfish

               pastes, such as shrimp paste or crab paste, can also be referred to by this word. Tinapa paste


               is  used  as  a  condiment  or  spice  to  enhance  the  flavor  of  food  or,  in  rare  situations,  to

               compliment  a  meal.  Tinapa  paste  is  often  reduced  to  a  thick,  rich  concentration  after  being

               boiled for an extended period of time. It derives from fish sauce, which is similar to fish paste

               except that it is not cooked as long, is a thick liquid rather than a concentrated paste, and may

               contain spices.



                   Tinapa, or smoked fish, is eaten for breakfast, lunch, and supper, with tomatoes and onions

               on the side, and garlic-flavored vinegar for dipping. This will absolutely bring out your appetite.

               Most Western cultures may disagree, but for most Filipinos, it would be a home run. It's not just


               a simple tinapa that we know because it has a twist that can be made into pasta sauce, a dip in

               viand, or be paired with rice.The tinapa we used is from Tanza because this is the place that is

               popular when it comes to seafood and so on.]]></page><page Index="163"><![CDATA[II.    Market Size



                        Tinapa is one of the most popular ready-to serve fish products available in the market

                   all  year  round.  Tinapaste  and  dip  and  at  the  same  time  improving  the  earnings  of  the

                   adopters/processors  by  providing  consumers  better  smoked  fish  product  that  ensures

                   sustainability of market preference of the consumers. This statement is particularly true in


                   the Tagalog region; Manila, Malabon, Navotas and some municipalities of cavite, Bulacan,

                   Bataan and Quezon. It is believed that it is in Quezon that smoked fish is first accepted as a

                   common  dish  to  be  consumed  with  rice.  The  average  rate  of  consumption  of  dried  and

                   smoked fish in the Philippines is 4 kilos per capita per annum. Smoked fish or Tinapa, as it

                   is locally called, has a lucrative market in towns bordering Manila Bay. Smoked fish products

                   are commonly referred to as tinapa. Smoked fish may come in different form: drawn, soft-


                   boned  or  deboned.  Smoked  drawn  milkfish  is  the  conventional  smoked  bangus.  It  is

                   estimated that in eating the conventional tinapa, some 30% of the fish maybe wasted due to

                   the singling-out of the flesh bones. On the other hand, smoked soft-boned bangus makes

                   the product 98% edible since even the bones can be eaten having been softened by subject

                   into high pressure. Smoked deboned milkfish is more convenient to consume considering

                   that  the  bones  are  already  removed.  Smoked  fish  can  be  kept  for  three  days  at  room

                   temperature, 15 days at refrigeration temperature and 3 to 6 months in frozen storage.











                   III.   Consumer Trends



                        Tinapa, a Filipino term, refers to fish that has been cooked or preserved by smoking. It

                   is a native delicacy in the Philippines and is frequently made from blackfin scads (known as]]></page><page Index="164"><![CDATA[galunggong)  or  milkfish  (known  as  bangus).  The  purpose  of  smoking  fish  is  generally  to

                   impart the distinct taste and flavor imparted by the smoking process. Because of its distinct

                   flavor, it is a popular breakfast item in the Philippines, where it is paired with garlic fried rice

                   known as sinangag, vinegar, and egg, and making smoked fish, or tinapa, at home is an


                   excellent business to start. There are other products similar to tinapa, such as tuyo, sap sap,

                   and daing. We used to only see it in plastic with newspaper, but now we see it in a container

                   or in a jar. And often, they are just fried to make a dish. But now it’s evolving because we

                   can already see it making it a gourmet food. Gourmet Tuyo is a current food trend in the

                   Philippines. It is made from dried herrings soaked in olive oil with spices. In its ordinary form,


                   dried herring is usually fried and served for breakfast with fried rice, chopped tomatoes, and

                   fried scrambled eggs. Because it's trending, we came up with the idea of making this paste,

                   since we rarely see dried fish made into this paste, and that's what we thought, and instead

                   of soaking the whole fish in oil with the spices, all we have to do is grind them and make a

                   paste that can be eaten directly or be made into a spread. And this paste will also come in

                   different flavors, like spicy and sweet. This paste will also be aromatic. And it will be cheaper

                   to buy, and it will also last a long time. This product is 2 in 1 because you can make it as a


                   dish or you can make it into a spread.
