January 2022","EXECUTIVE SUMMARY                          A shell or seashell, additionally referred to just as a shell, is a hard, defensive external                 layer for the most part made by a creature that lives in the ocean. The shell is important for                 the body of the creature. Void shells are frequently tracked down appeared on sea shores by                 wanderers. The shells are unfilled in light of the fact that the creature has kicked the bucket                 and the delicate parts have deteriorated or been eaten by another creature.                      A shell is normally the exoskeleton of an invertebrate (a creature without a spine), and is                 ordinarily made out of calcium carbonate or chitin. Most shells that are found on sea shores                  are the shells of calcium carbonate, and bear better compared to shells made or chitin.                      Aside from mollusk shells, different shells that can be found on sea shores are those of                 barnacles, horseshoe crabs and brachiopods. Marine annelid worms in the family Serpulidae                 make shells which are tubes made of calcium carbonate solidified onto different surfaces. The                 shells of ocean imps are designated ‘tests’, and the shed shells of crabs and lobsters are                  exuviae. While most shells are outside, a few cephalopods have interior shells.                      Our product which is Luscious Seashell can use as gifts or souvenir in any events, it can                 also use as decoration in house specially in kitchen or dining room.                      Shells have been utilized by people for various purposes since the beginning and ancient                 times.  In  any  case,  shells  are  not  by  any  means  the  only  sort  of  shells;  in  different                 environments, there are shells from freshwater creatures, for example, freshwater mussels                 and freshwater snails, and shells of land snails.","PRODUCT OVERVIEW                     I. Product Concept                      Seashells or simply shells have various types and sizes. Animals from the sea are the                 ones who usually create it. These shells are mostly collected from around the world because                 of its vivid and unique construction. They are used for decorations, jewelry and buttons in the                 industry. Hence, they are not only used as display but also some of them can be eaten. These                  shells also help the country’s economy because of its uses and can be a great medium for                 researches.                      Since Philippines is surrounded by bodies of water, we can’t deny that or country is fond                 of seashells. Plenty of handicrafts and decorations are being made of it. In 2016, Department                 of science and Technology (DOST) granted to boost the Capiz’ handicraft production in Cavite                  known in the Philippines as the mother-of-pearl shells. The granted them a new set of planting                 facility  with  complete  accessories  and  low-cost  furnace  dry  to  develop  and  enhance  the                 production capacity and quality. Through this, Cavite will be able to promote the importance                 of seashells to the industry and spread awareness on how these shells help or ecology to                 move forward. According to the 2001 Fisheries Administrative Order 208 of Philippines Laws,                 they must protect and conserve the rare, threatened and endangered species od shells from                 the people who collects and damages them only for their personal purposes.                       We may think that shells are just shells but to biodiversity and ecology they mean so much                 than just a decoration. Shells are said to be the major players in the web of life. Once they are                 wiped out it would result in ecological imbalance that would result not only to our loss but also                 to the animals who mostly relies on it. It serves as the shelter of smaller marine lifeforms and                 some of kind of crabs. Some shells help fight the ocean acidification and the removal of large                 shells will also affect the rate of shore erosion.","II. Market Size                      According to Paul Zahl Ph. D. of National Geographic (1969), Philippines together with its                  thousands of islands, reefs and marine habitats, the country is considered a mecca of sea                 shell collectors. Along the vast region of the Philippines lies the Indo-Pacific region of the                 Philippines lies the Indo-Pacific region which contains the world’s most diverse sea shells.                 One of the best hunting grounds are said to be in the islands of Sulu Sea and also the province                 of Cavite.                       There are 12,000 or more species of seashells in the Philippines, both the largest shells,                 Tridacna gigas, and smallest shells, Pisidum, can be found on the Philippines waters. Not only                 does the country has beautiful seashells but also has shells that can be eaten. It is common                 in Philippine cuisine to have different foods with shells such as mussels, mollusks and oyster.                      Also, based on the study by Solidum, J.N (2011), several coastal islands especially the                 province of Cavite, produce most of the various types of shell waste that are normally thrown                 away on open garbage areas which somehow cause numerous problems to the citizens. So,                  in order to lessen the wastes being deployed, the wastes being reused and recycled. One of                 the products which clearly shows the reuse and recycle method is the Luscious Seashells. It                 consists  of  shells  that  are  beautifully  arranged  and  gathered  in  a  glass  dome  to  use  as                 decoration.                 III.

The  characteristic  of  vision  statement  is                 precisely  envision.  However,  it  can  be  changed  to  attract  and  appeal  to  the  present  and                 future investors and stakeholders. The strength of their vision statement is very specific that                 they want to be on top and globally competitor in direct selling industry.

On the other hand, MSE doesn't include other                 components but this mission is inspiring and enduring.                         C. Evaluation of Mission Statement                       The  firms  mission  focused  on  the  purpose  of  providing  satisfaction  to  the  customers                 need and wants of kids, men and women, especially to provide quality and long-lasting shoe                 for all. They are confident because, MSE is loyal to customers in order for them to trust the                 company and employees.                         D. Strengths and Weaknesses of Mission Statement                          Like  other  firms,  MSE  also  has  its  own  strengths.  First,  they  provide  high  quality                 products. Next, they give satisfaction to customers. Next, they provide reasoble price. Then,                 their mission is concerned with survival, growth and profitability. And finally, their products                 were originally made in the Philippines.                      The MSE also has its weaknesses. They do not include components like where the firm                 competes.  And  the  products  are  made  only  in  the  Philippines,  but  there  are  some  cities                 where MSE is not popular.","8                          E. Proposed Changes in the Mission Statement                       MSE  mission  statement  must  have  changes  like  in  its  own  mission,  this  need  to  be                 improved and be short but completely include other components. The business world today                 is changing, so MSE should take the trend like an e-commerce and change its promotion.                  The proposed mission statement is, to produce and promote high quality Filipino products to                 the customers and contribute the growth in the country.","9                  III.

Industry Analysis                     A.  Industry Features                             Features of the shoe industry in the Philippines, the core of which is located in                     Marikina City in the northeast of the Manila Metropolitan Area. Initial discussions delve                     with general remarks on industrial clusters and commodity chains with a detailed account                     of their internal structure and changing fortunes. The deeply-rooted failures of the cluster                     since the early 1990s are pinpointed. These can be directly related to the liberalization of                      the Filipino economy, and the concomitant increase in Chinese-made shoes on domestic                     markets. Various private and public responses to the crisis are described and evaluated.                     It is argued that as helpful as many of these responses may be, their overall impact is                     likely to remain limited. Series of possible policy options and their high risks of failure are                     emphasized.  In  conclusion,  the  study  presents  a  developmental  scenario  based  on                     cluster upgrading and intensified export activity.                     B.  Industry Boundaries                             Located along the eastern border of Metro Manila, Marikina is the main gateway                     of  Metro  Manila  to Rizal and Quezon provinces  through  Marcos  Highway  (Marikina–                     Infanta  Highway).  It  is  bordered  on  the  west  by Quezon  City,  to  the  south                     by Pasig and Cainta, to the north by San Mateo, and to the east by Antipolo, the capital                     of Rizal province.

Industry Analysis                                A.  Industry features                                   The  food  industry  is  very  large,  and  if  food  production,  manufacturing,                                   marketing, restaurants and institutions are combined, it is the largest industrial                                   enterprise.  An  appreciation  of the  size,  components,  interrelationships, and                                   responsiveness  to  change  of  the  food  industry  enlarges  food  scientists’                                    understanding of the environment in which they operate.                                  B.  Industry Boundaries                                   From  the  word  boundary  itself  which  means  a  border  or  a  limit,  industry                                   boundaries could be defined as the point at which industries ends or beyond                                   which it becomes something else. This means that industry boundaries are the                                   demarcations between two distinct industries, and so it encompasses both the                                    supply and demand trajectories.                                   Understanding  the  industries  and  its  sectors  and  monitoring  the                                   macroeconomic  environment  are  the  two  main  objectives  of  industry                                   boundaries whereby organizational strategies are at the core of the business                                   conduct.                                   C.  Industry Environment                                   Restaurants and other food-service providers are so widespread that half of all                                   adults have worked in food service in one way or another at some point in their                                   lives. The food service industry encompasses any establishment that serves","17                                    food  to  people  outside  their  home.  This  includes  restaurants,  carryout                                   operations, cafeterias, university dining halls, catering and vending companies,                                   hotels and inns, and rehab and retirement centers.                                      This industry is divided into two groups: Those that prepare and serve food and                                   those that produce and distribute food, equipment, and services needed by                                   food providers. The most common example of the first group is restaurants.                                   Restaurants employ front of the house people and back of the house people.                                   The  former  includes  bartenders,  wait  staff,  hosts,  and  busboys.  The  latter                                    includes chefs, cooks, managers, and dishwashers. Fast food restaurants limit                                   their staff to food preparation people, managers, and cashiers. The trend of                                   food trucks adds a mobile component to food service and requires just a few                                   people to drive the truck, cook the food, and serve it through a window.                                  D.  Industry Structure                                   Foodservice establishments are projected to capture 53 percent of consumers’                                    food  expenditures,  whereas  in  1980,  foodservice  captured  less  than  40                                   percent. The foodservice industry accounts for approximately 4 percent of the                                   Gross  Domestic  Product  and  about  11  million  jobs.  It  has  been  rapidly                                   changing  due  to  economic  factors,  technological  advances,  and  labor                                   matters.1 This overview covers many of the issues and trends affecting the                                    different segments of the foodservice supply chain including the foodservice                                   operators,  distributors  and  food  manufacturers.  Changing  customer                                   demographics are a driving force in the evolution of the foodservice industry.                                   As the baby boomers reach middle age, they do not seem to have time to cook                                   and their children and grandchildren do not seem to have the interest, or talent.","18                                   E.  Industry attractiveness                                   Products  will  continue  to  roll  out  to  meet  consumers’  health  and  wellness                                   desires, and plant-based meats will keep making a dent in the market.                                    Food and beverage service is the essential link between the customers and                                   the menu,  beverages  and  other  services  on  offer  in  an  establishment. The                                   server  is  the  main  point  of  contact  between  the  customers  and  the                                   establishment  and  plays  an  important  role  in  a  profession  with  increasing                                   national and international status.

Industry Performance                                   A performance appraisal for customer service expectations is more than simply                                   evaluating employees on whether they greet customers with a smile or whether                                   managers effectively resolve conflicts with suppliers who fail to provide high-                                   quality food products for use in their restaurants. Performance appraisals for                                   customer service in the F\&B world delve deeper into duties such as how to                                    ensure each restaurant patron has an enjoyable dining experience or the ability                                   for  a  bartender  to  take  off  his  mixologist  hat  and  make  the  transition  to                                   psychologist and confidante for a customer who stops in to have a cocktail after                                   a stressful day in the office. Service standards also include the techniques for                                   recommending selections to customers based on questions about customers’                                    preferences, how to approach customers throughout their meal and the timing                                   that wait staff should use when deciding whether to recommend the dessert                                   selections or simply bring the bill.","19                                 G.

June, 2021","INTRODUCTION                           In order for a country to succeed as a nation, it requires that its leaders observe and                 practice  good  governance  in  the  performance  of  their  duties  as  public  officials.  Good                 governance is defined by UNESCAP as the process of decision-making and the process by                  which  decisions  are  implemented  (or  not  implemented).  While,  Social  responsibility  is  an                 ethical  theory  in  which  individuals  are  accountable  for  fulfilling  their  civic  duty,  and  the                  actions  of  an  individual  must  benefit  the  whole  of  society.  In  this  way,  there  must  be  a                 balance  between  economic  growth  and  the  welfare  of  society  and  the  environment.                  (Pachama,2021) Looking into the barangay level, good governance is also being expected by                 the government and of the people. As stipulated in the Local Government Code of 1991, “the                 chief executive of the  Barangay is  given with  executive power for  efficient,  effective and                  economical governance, the purpose of which is the general welfare of the barangay and its                  people. Along this line, the Sangguniang Barangay members shall enact ordinances as may                 be necessary to discharge the responsibilities conferred upon it by law or ordinance and to                 promote the general welfare of the people.” As such, all the elected officials are expected to                  perform their functions accordingly, most especially considering the interests of all residents                 through  good  governance.  In  order  to  address  the  issues  and  concerns  in  the  community,                  resolutions and ordinances are being crafted by the barangay officials, “the barangay serves                 as  the  primary  planning  and  implementing  unit  of  government  policies,  plans,  programs,                  projects and activities in the community.”  Its roles in nation-building really matter. Given                 this demanding role, it is only proper and correct to assess the capacity readiness of every                 Brgy. Officials in delivering expected outcomes to their respective community.                           Barangay Lambingan is a barangay in the municipality of Tanza, in the province of                 Cavite. Its population as determined by the 2015 Census was 1,850. This represented 0.82%                  of the total population of Tanza.","A  barangay  is  the  smallest  administrative  division  in  the  Philippines  it has  several                 powers, duties,  and functions.  The Punong Barangay  is  the one who  enforce all laws and                  ordinances;  maintain  public order;  ensure the delivery of basic services;  enforce laws and                 regulations relating to pollution control and protection of the environment; adopt measures to                  prevent  and  control  the  proliferation  of  squatters;  and  adopt  measures  to  prevent  and                 eradicate  drug  abuse,  child  abuse,  and  juvenile  delinquency.  While  the  Sangguniang                  Barangay  can  enact  ordinances;  levy  taxes  and  other  revenue  measures;  provide  for                 construction and maintenance of barangay facilities and other public works; regulate use of                  public facilities, including waterworks; etc.                          Therefore, this research aims to know what are the duties of every brgy. officials and                 how do they meet the needs of their community. Specially in today’s time that we experience                  pandemic,  what  are  the  things  they  do  to  serve  their  people  and  how  did  they  manage  to                  balance a good relationship between its community.

Performance  is                 equated  with  the  local  government’s  responses  to  the  community’s  needs,  particularly  the                  provision of basic and essential public services. High performance is the result of rational                 decision-making; optimal use of resources such as funds, personnel, equipment, etc.; and the                  delivery  of  basic  public  services  in  a  timely  and  sustained  manner.  Performance  can  be                 assessed in terms of the local governments’ capabilities to respond to the community’s need                  for  basic  essential  services.  Local  government  performance  is  then  measurable  through                 discernible improvement in the quality of life of individuals, the society as a whole, and more                 importantly the poor. (Acosta, 1991)                           In  assessing  the  delivery  of  services  in  the  social,  economic,  political,  and                 environmental sectors, Functionality performance is used. In Functionality Performance, the                  degree of productivity is determined by comparing the actual LGU services against service                 standards  prescribed  by  the  national  government  agencies  concerned.  On  the  other  hand,                  Service  Delivery  Outcome  Assessment  is  used  to  determine  the  effect  of  the  services                 delivered by the LGUs to the citizen’s quality of life, particularly the impact of the services to                  the  socioeconomic  conditions  of  the  residents,  especially  the  poor.  (World  Academy  of                 Science, Engineering and Technology International Journal of Economics and Management                 Engineering Vol:2, No:10, 2008)                           In the Philippines, through the Department of Interior and Local Government, Seal of                 Good Local Governance for Barangay Assessment (SGLGB) is one of the most commonly","used  performance  indicator  systems  at  the  barangay  level.  It  is  a  self-assessment  LGU                 performance  by  measuring  multi  sectorial  impact  and  the  presence/number  of  services,                  facilities, projects, plans, programs, and policies, while emphasizing on good governance and                 administration. The result of the evaluation will guide the policy makers in making decisions                  towards the modification of their strategies in implementing a program. SGLGB can also be                 used in the identification of Bottlenecks or impediments in the program mechanisms for the                  purpose of early corrective measures in order not to waste resources and energies. The system                 is essential in determining the LGU particularly the barangay its level of functionality and                  performance  in  order  to  enable  local  leaders  to  improve  the  quality  of  local  policies,                 programs, and services for greater transparency and accountability in government operations.                  (DILG, 2001)                  Local  governments  also  have  a  very  crucial  role  to  play  in  the  attainment  of  government                  goals  under  the  Sustainable  Development  Goals  Declaration.  The  need  to  encourage  local                 governments  to  reallocate  resources  towards  basic  social  services  and  intensify  efforts                 towards  the  implementation  of  programs,  projects,  and  activities  that  are  responsive  to                  sustainable  Development  Goals  or  SDG  had  been  underscored  time  and  again.  The                 sustainable  Development  Goals  is  a  set  of  time-bound,  measurable  goals  and  targets  for                  combating The 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs) to transform the world: It consists                 of  17  goals  and  there  are  169  targets  for  the  17  goals.  Each  target  has  between  1  and  3                  indicators used to  measure progress  toward reaching the targets.  The  innovative strategies                 and tested approaches in promoting good governance and pursuing sustainable development,                 are  now  being  implemented  in  several  Philippine  communities.  Thus,  in  keeping  with  the                  theme  of  the  campaign,  the  United  Nation’s  Agenda  2030  and  Sustainable  Development                 Goals (SDGs) pick up where the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) left off. The SDGs                  set  forth  a  formidable  task  for  the  global  community  and  international  sustainable","development over the next 15 years. Learning from the successes and failures of the MDGs,                 government  officials,  development  experts,  and  many  other  groups  understood  that                  localization is  necessary to  accomplish  the SDGs  but  how and what  to  localize  remain as                 questions to be answered. (Patole,2018)                           According to Haslinda, Alia, and Faizah (2016) corporate social responsibility is the                 responsibility  of  companies  to  incorporate  the  economic,  legal,  ethical  and  philanthropic                  needs of the community in their business plans at a given time. This shows that firms should                 offer  some  things  that  communities  need.  Furthermore,  businesses  might  merely  have  a                  means of staying alive for a long time, if they accomplish their CSR activities. Likewise, the                 communities  should  encourage  and  assist  companies  to  attain  their  economic  goals,  this                 would be done through the provision of product safety and proper provision of employees’                  health facilities. Supplementary communities are anticipating the companies to perform their                  ethical  responsibilities,  through  making  their  business  activities  in  accord  with  societal                 values.  Finally,  voluntary  responsibilities  are  those  social  activities  required  by  the                 communities higher than economic, legal and ethical commitments.                           The  concept  of  corporate  social  responsibility  is  a  straightforward  subject  of                 discussion  among  companies  and  stakeholders  that  continued  drawing  the  attention  of  the                  governance of the companies. This happened as a result of the requirements of the members                 of the community toward the need of businesses to include communities’ environmental and                  social problems into the company’s activity strategy since the company’s interests are beyond                 making  a  profit  to  only  shareholders,  but  to  both  stakeholders  and  shareholders.  The                  companies are expected to be more productive in thinking, more especially, on the ways and                 processes  of  alleviating  and  solving  the  needs  of  different  groups  of  stakeholders.                 Stakeholders comprise employees, government, members of the community, Consumers and                  the  owners  of  businesses  who  have  a  stake  in  a  company.  Moreover,  in  a  competitive","business environment, companies are required to accommodate the interests of the different                 stakeholder  groups,  to  gain  image  and  reputation.  Besides,  firms  are  supposed  to  be                  accountable  and  open  to  the  stakeholders.  As  a  result,  owners  are  evaluating  companies,                 financial  performance  and  government  are  evaluating  companies’  compliance  with  the                  relevant legislation (Thi and Pham, 2018)                          Epistemologically,  legitimacy  theory  describes  CSR  activities  conducted  by                  companies  as  a  standard,  ethics,  duties,  and  approaches  to  gaining  a  standard  legitimacy.                 Therefore,  legitimacy  is  a  process  of  making  the  company  being  suitable,  sustainable  and                  good to the members of the community as well as, making the companies operate under a                 socially  build  system  of  standards,  ethics,  and  beliefs  of  the  society.  (Odoemelam  and                 Okafor, 2018)                           One notable study was that of Caldo (2015) who tried to link good governance to the                 competency of the barangay officials. He assessed the competency measures of the barangay                  council officials, and the findings show that the Punong Barangay and Sangguniang barangay                 members have strong belief that they are competent in performing their duties and functions;                  but this contradicts to the response of selected residents who said that they are uncertain to                 the performance of their barangay officials                           According  to  Antal  Szerletics  (2000),  the  notion  of  good  governance  can  be                 conceived as a basket of many practices, including, for example, professional civil service,                  anti-corruption  policies,  transparency  and  accountability,  democratic  decision-making,  the                 principle  of  the  rule  of  law,  protection  of  human  rights  and  independent  judiciary.  The                 constitutive  elements  of  good  governance  vary  according  to  the  particular  international                  organization and the particular document we examine.","According to Lipson (1965), Politics involves the fundamentals of social order with                 the formation of groups. Society is a system of groups which are the breeding grounds for                  politics.  Good  governance  can  foster  public  participation  in  policymaking  and  promote                 inclusion  in  decision-making  processes.  A  society  that  is  well  governed  should  provide                  maximum  opportunities  for  every  individual  to  realize  his  full  human  potential.  Thus,  by                 practicing  good  governance  in  a  basic  political  unit  such  as  the  barangay,  it  can  be  an                  effective tool for the promotion of the general welfare of the people, thus would serve as an                 assessment  for  the  performance  of  the  elective  barangay  officials.  This  inquiry  notes  that                  good  governance  of  a  barangay  can  be  affected  by  the  lack  of  capabilities  of  officials;                 indecisiveness during assumption of duties as officers‐in‐charge","METHODOLOGY                           This chapter presents the methodology of the study. It includes the research design,                 sources  of  data,  data  gathering  procedure,  data  analysis,  statistical  treatment  of  data  and                 research instrument.                   RESEARCH DESIGN                          The  study  used  descriptive  method.  According  to  the  Office  of  Human  Research                  Protections  (OHRP,  1998),  a  descriptive  study  provides  information  about  the  naturally                 occurring  health  status,  behavior,  attitudes  or  other  characteristics  of  a  particular  group.                  Likewise, Shields,  Patricia and  Rangarjan (2013) stated that descriptive research design is                 used to describe the characteristics of a population or phenomenon being studied.  This type                  of  research  method  was  used  to  asses  systematically  the  good  governance  and  social                 responsibility of brgy. officials factually and accurately.                  SAMPLE AND SAMPLE TECHNIQUE                           The researchers conducted the study in Brgy. Lambingan, Tanza, Cavite. They will                 provide  survey  questionnaire  to  gather  information  about  the  “Assessment  of  Good                  Governance  and  Social  Responsibility  of  Brgy.officials  to  its  community”  from  the                 respondents.                           The study was limited to gather survey in 20 Brgy. Officials and residents from Brgy.                 Lambingan, Tanza, Cavite. The researcher used the simple random sampling in choosing the                  participants of study.","SOURCES OF DATA                           Data is one of the most important and vital aspect of the research. In this research the                 source of data will be primarily based on the conducted online survey from the respondents.                 In relation to the primary data source, it will be supported with our secondary source that will                  come from the articles, journals, previous studies carried out for other investigation that is                 related to the topic.                   DATA GATHERING PROCEDURE                          The researchers came up a questionnaire that may give to the 20 barangay officials                  and residents of Brgy. Lambingan  but due to quarantine brought by the  pandemic, survey                 questionnaires created from google form will be sent to participants through messenger. Data                  collected from participants will be used to analyze the study.                  DATA ANALYSIS                           The researchers collected the data within the survey. It focuses on good governance                 and social responsibility of every barangay official to their community. This research used                 descriptive  analysis  to  assess  the  duties  and  performance  of  every  Brgy.officials.  The                  participants  are  chosen  through  simple  random  sampling  which  the  researchers  chose  a                 person randomly to answer a survey questionnaire.

It                 is also a leader’s continuous exercise of authority over and the performance of functions for a                 political unit like the barangay. It refers to the organization, machinery or agency through                  which  a  political  unit  is  exercise,  authority  and  performs  functions  with  distribution  of                 powers to official or governing body. According to Robert Presthus (1975), political interest                  permeates the whole fabric of Government- a machinery or agency in which the political unit                 exercises authority and performs its functions. Public administration or governance works in                  a highly political environment. Politics searches for ends as well as means for the betterment                 of the society it serves: in terms of structure, political exercise, influences and attempts to                 bind  communities  on  political  issues.  According  to  Lipson  (1965),  Politics  involves  the                  fundamentals  of  social  order  with  the  formation  of  groups.  Society  is  a  system  of  groups                  which are the breeding grounds for politics. Good governance can foster public participation                 in policymaking and promote inclusion in decision-making processes. A society that is well                 governed  should  provide  maximum  opportunities  for  every  individual  to  realize  his  full                  human potential. Thus by  practicing  good governance in  a basic political  unit such as  the                 barangay, it can be an effective tool for the promotion of the general welfare of the people,                  thus would serve as an assessment for the performance of the elective barangay officials. This                 inquiry notes that good governance of a barangay can be affected by the lack of capabilities                  of  officials;  indecisiveness  during  assumption  of  duties  as  officers‐in‐charge.  Influence  of                 their siblings and family relatives and sensitivity of the issues and concerns being addressed.                  We cannot deny the fact that most of the people who run for political positions were mostly                 influenced by their family of traditional politicians, if not, most of them just rose to fame and                  won the election due to popularity, without considering the capability of that person, hence,                 disregarding their merits and competencies. The barangay being the basic political unit has","always been at the forefront of local development undertakings in the country. Collectively,                 the barangays are partners of the national government to respond to development challenges                  because  of  their  strategic  situation  at  the  grassroots  level  especially  in  the  effective  and                 efficient  service  delivery  to  the  community.  The  synergy  created  51  INTERNATIONAL                  JOURNAL  OF  BUSINESS  AND  MANAGEMENT  STUDIES  Vol  9,  No  1,  2017  ISSN:                 1309-8047 (Online) by the barangays in service delivery reflects the state of governance of                  the city or the municipality. As the basic political unit, the barangay serves as the primary                 planning  and  implementing  unit  of  government  programs,  basic  services,  projects  and                  activities and as a forum in which the collective views of the people in the community may                 be crystallized and considered. Through the barangay assembly, people at the grassroots level                  may legislate directly on matters of local concerns, making it the nearest conduit to direct                 democracy in the Philippines. In the same manner, Republic Act 7160, otherwise known as                 the Local Government  Code of 1991 mandates that the barangay discharges three seminal                  functions: a) as a political unit b)as a primary planning and implementing unit and c) as a                 forum. As a basic political unit, the barangay is the smallest body politic used for governance                  in  the  country  being  a  political  subdivision  of  the  national  government.  As  a  primary                 planning and implementing unit, the barangay is mandated to plan development projects and                  programs and implement government policies and activities in the community, create projects                 in its territory and to deliver basic services of the government to the people. As a forum, the                  barangay gets the sound views of the people on various political topics. Moreover, it also                 provides  a  venue  for  settling  disputes  amicably.  In  society  today,  man  has  always                  encountered management challenges and peculiarities everywhere he goes. However, it does                 not necessarily mean that man has to enter politics in order to serve his people. Although, in                 today’s trend, man usually renders service to his fellowmen, if one positions himself in an                  elective office. Our society is increasingly dominated by the belief of individual merit. This","belief is that people should achieve success through hard work and ability. This is seen as the                 fairest and most especially an efficient way to distribute the social status and marital rewards                  within  the  society.  We  need  to  have  competent  government  leaders  that  can  promote  the                 general     welfare     of    the     public     especially    the    grassroots     level.(                  https://dergipark.org.tr/en/download/article-file/440187)                            The article discovers the congruence of governance principles and actual administrative                  practices  in  local  legislative  chamber  in  Nueva  Ecija,  Philippines.  By  using  case  study,  it                 measured  the  influence  of  governance  principles  to  legislative  performance  and                  organizational  effectiveness.  The  good  governance  principles  of  citizens’  participation,                 accountability  and  transparency  are  correlated  to  legislative  performance.  Inspired  by  the                 organization  theory  of  systems  model,  the  result  showed  that  there  is  a  link  between                  organizational  effectiveness,  legislative  performance  and  observance  of  good  governance                  principles.  The  study  recommends  that  scientific  inquiry  be  done  to  measure  degree  of                 convergence  and  divergence  of  theory  and  practice  in  Philippine  administrative  system.

It  includes  the                  mechanisms  required  to  balance  the  powers  of  the  members  with  the  associated                 accountability  and  their  primary  duty  of  enhancing  the  prosperity  and  viability  of  the                  organization.  Good  governance  is  about  the  processes  for  making  and  implementing                 decisions. It is not about making ‘correct’ decisions, but about the best possible process for                 making  those  decisions.  Good  decision-making  processes  and  good  governance  therefore                  share  several  characteristics.  Both  have  a  positive  effect  on  various  aspects  of  local","government  including  consultation  on  policies  and  practices,  meeting  procedures,  service                 quality  protocols,  councillors  and  officers’  conduct,  role  clarification  and  good  working                  relationships.  As the basic political  unit, the barangay serves  as  the primary  planning and                 implementing  unit  of  government  policies,  plans,  programs,  projects,  and  activities  in  the                  community and as  a forum  wherein the collective views  of the people  may  be  expressed,                 crystallized and given due course and an avenue wherein contending claims maybe amicably                  settled. This  study focuses  in  determining the competencies of Punong barangay  for  good                 governance as perceived by their constituents utilizing the descriptive research design. This                  method  described  the  competencies  of  the  Punong  barangays  for  good  governance.                 Respondents  utilized  in  this  undertaking  were  the  community  residents  of  the  barangays                  being surveyed. There were 40 respondents per barangay for a total of 400 respondents. An                 interview  schedule  and  structured  questionnaire  were  used  in  gathering  the  data.  The                 questionnaire was pre-tested at Afusing, Alcala, Cagayan and validated before it was finally                  administered to the respondents. Data were analyzed using frequency counts and percentages.                 (  Prof.  Irene  P.

It  follows  a  Descriptive-Survey  Research  Design                 utilizing FGD, KII and survey questionnaire as data gathering methodologies and instrument.                  To  analyze  the  data,  frequency  count,  percentage,  and  weighted  mean  were  used.  It  was","found out that despite the limited number of barangay ordinances catering to identified areas,                 the barangay’s Good Governance Index (GGI) is 88.8 (Very Satisfactory). However, it was                  identified  that  with  limited  barangay  ordinances,  not  all  reported  cases  were  solved  and                 penalized.  Majority  of  the  residents  believed  that  the  inefficiency  was  caused  by                  miscommunication between barangay officials due to political differences. Other identified                 contributory  factors  include:  improper  information  dissemination  and  inadequate                  communication  with  residents.  Despite  these  problems,  majority  of  the  residents  are  still                 highly and moderately satisfied of their local leaders’ leadership. Some of the priority needs                  on governance include: training on local governance, team building workshops (recollections                 and retreats), and office management seminars. As such, it was recommended that extension                  planners conduct SWOT analysis and other activities in the barangay to address neglected                 areas on governance and education.

This  movement  has  not  only                 provided opportunities for collaboration and cooperation between and among the three major                  governance actors, governments, business, and civil society, but more important, provided a                 framework for active citizen engagement  in  the process  of improving their quality of life.                  Citizen  participation  is  central  not  only  in  the  theory  of  social  quality  but  also  in  good                 governance.  The  paper  argues  argues  that  in  order  for  reforms  to  be  successful  and                 sustainable, institutional reforms and active citizen engagement are necessary. These reforms                  are key to addressing some basic problems facing nations today, an alarming decline in trust","in institutions and corruption. This paper is divided into three parts. The first part discusses                 good governance approaches and reform of public administration in relation to social quality                  theory. The second part discusses the tenets of citizenship and civil organization leadership                 within  the  context  of  good  governance.  The  third  part  focuses  on  an  emerging  citizens’                  movement in the Philippines—the Gawad Kalinga movement, which highlights the aspects of                 citizen engagement. The last part contains some concluding remarks drawn from the Gawad                  Kalinga experience as applied governance reform, and its implications for enhancing social                 quality.(   Author:    Alex    B.

Barangay  governance  gives  an  important  role  in                  setting  direction  to  the  people  in  the  barangay  level.  It  is  an  empowerment  of  the  local                  government  units  in  the  country  where  this  present  study  is  interested.  This  quantitative-                 qualitative research study intended to look into the Barangay Governance Capabilities among                 Barangay Captains in Northeast of Catanduanes, Philippines as basis for Catanduanes State                  University  Panganiban  Campus  Extension  Program.  The  data  gathered  through  the                 questionnaire  and  interview  guide  concluded  that  the  Respondent-Barangay  Officials  in                  Northeast  of  Catanduanes  are  in  the  Middle  Age,  Male,  College  Level  in  Educational                 Attainment,  Barangay  Council  Members  and  a  neophyte  in  barangay  governance  having                  served for three years and below as barangay officials. The indicators of governance revealed                 that  Barangay  Captains  are  more  equipped  with  Barangay  Fiscal  Administration  than  in                 Legislative and Judicial functions. The unstructured interview about the problems regarding                  the governance capabilities of barangay captains reveals the incompetence of the Barangay                 Captains, the non-cooperation of the residents or the constituents themselves, and the non-                  cooperative Barangay Kagawad that genuinely affects the capability of the Barangay Captain.","Given the situation, the study recommends that barangay officials, particularly the barangay                 captains,  are  enjoined  to  attend  the  Barangay  Governance  Capability  training  seminar.                  Intensive monitoring and assessment of their barangay performance should be done regularly.

This is the main question answered in this paper, which                  partially evaluates the sensitivity of the Index, as a whole, to its component indicators and its                  consistency with other similar indices using primary data. An empirical evaluation has now                 become necessary, given the myriad of indicators already developed, which all presumably                 have  been  vetted  for  their  theoretical  merits.  The  2001  compilation  of  indicators  of  good                  governance prepared by the Philippine Business for Social Progress (PBSP) already contains                 30 sets initiated by academic institutions, government agencies, civil society organizations                  and donor agencies. The list does not even include other previously adopted initiatives such                 as the DSWD’s Minimum Basic Needs (MBN) and the HDN-UNDP’s Human Development                  Index (HDI). Surely, however, the profusion of indicators systems is partly justified given the                 complexity  of  governance  issues  confronting  the  Philippines,  and  the  various  approaches                 taken toward these issues, which, in turn, then lead to diverse policy proposals and action                  programs for different stakeholders. Nonetheless, PBSP’s attempt at classification should be                 taken a step further towards consolidation and cooperation among the concerned proponents,                  if  only  to  re-channel  the  considerable  resources  spent  on  measurements  to  actual,  useful","social  intervention  programs.  Approaches  at  consolidation  can  be  both  theoretical  and                 empirical.  But  where  the  indicators  systems  all  pass  theoretical  evaluation,  a  resort  to                  empirical tests will then help achieve the objective. Many of those in the PBSP’s list have                 been empirically verified, although at various levels. This paper presents the partial results of                  an attempt to validate the GOFORDEV Index, developed by the Philippine Center for Policy                 Studies (PCPS) under its Governance Project1 . The results are based on the pilot test of the                  Index  in  twelve  cities  and  municipalities  in  Bulacan  and  Davao  del  Norte  in  2001.  In                 summary, the GOFORDEV Index offers some suggestions to improve the quality of local                  governance, is found not unduly biased by any of its component indicators, and also generally                 consistent with a few similar indicators. The rest of the paper is arranged as follows: The                  conceptual framework behind the GOFORDEV Index is described in Section 2, followed by                 a discussion in Section 3 of the methodology used in evaluating the Index. The results are                 presented in Section 4. Concluding remarks end the paper.                   (https://www.researchgate.net/)                            In  international  development  as  noted  at  the  Wikipedia,  good  governance  is  a                  subjective  term  that  describes  how  public  institutions  conduct  public  affairs  and  manage                 public resources in the preferred way. Governance is the process of decision – making and                  the process by which decisions are implemented or not. The term governance can apply to                 corporate,  international,  national,  local  governance  or  to  the  interactions  between  other                  sectors in the society.

The concept centers on the responsibility of governments and                 governing bodies to meet  the needs of the masses as opposed to select groups in    society.                  Because  countries  often  described  as  most  successful  are  liberal  democratic  states                 concentrated in Europe and the Americas( 2) Khan, Mushtaq Husain (2004).

Aid organizations and the authorities of developed countries often will focus the                  meaning of  “good governance “ to  a set  of requirements  that conform  to  the organization                 agenda , making good governance  imply many different things in many different contexts.

This paper presents the focal area of good governance in terms of delivering public                 services to the people from different sectors of the society such as Education and Healthcare,                  Social  Protection,  Financial  Management  ,  Peace  and  Security,  Business  Friendliness,                 Tourism,  Environmental  Management  and  Disaster  Preparedness.(4)  DILG  Memorandum                 Circular No. 2018-194 dated November 6, 2018.   There will be some indicators and data                  requirements  in  each  area  of  services  that  would  suggest,  prove  and  validate  that  good                 governance at the grass root level are met.","Through  these  strategies,  the  abilities  of  public  sector  institutions  particularly  the                 barangays in the City of Makati as well as the entire country to deliver key services more                  effectively and efficiently will be strengthened an these would help a range of public private,                 civil  society  partners  and  stakeholders  expand  access  to  and  improve  the  quality  of                  community services.

The research is  about  the assessment of the managerial  and leadership  skill  and the                  ethical  climate  of  the  chief  executives  and  senior  managers  in  Santa  Maria,  Bulacan,                 Philippines. Graft and corruption and other unethical practices are rampant in the Philippines,                 affecting the effective delivery of public service to the people even with the introduction of                  reforms in the government, and the existence of the laws and different policies. It is at this                 point  that  change  in  public  administration  must  lean  towards  reformation  of  people  in                  government service. The focus of this study was the local government units, because they are                 the front liners in the delivery of goods and services to the public. With devolved powers                  from  the  national  government,  the  local  government  officers  specifically  chief  executives                 such  as  mayor  and  barangay  chairmen,  together  with  senior  managers  of  their  respective                  units,  are  expected  to  work  in  an  ethical  climate,  to  manage  their  work,  people,  and                 environment effectively and efficiently leading them towards the achievement of their goals                  consistent  to  the  Philippine  Development  Plan  2017-2020.  The  study  utilized  descriptive                 design  and  percentage  frequency  distribution.  Data  were  collected  by  means  of  a  survey                 questionnaire.  It  is  self-assessment  based  on  competencies  and  indicators  in  the  survey-                  questionnaire and using the same set of questionnaire, the same local officials were evaluated","by  their  respective  constituents.  The  study  confirmed  that  managerial  and  leadership                 competencies and ethical climate are essential qualifications in good governance.                   (Lorena C. Valerio) (https://www.atlantis-press.com/proceedings/aapa-18/25896129)                            Findings of the study present a favorable picture of local governance and community                  development  in  the  sample  barangays  [villages].  Levels  of  efficiency  and  effectiveness  in                 revenue  collection  and  utilization  are  seen  to  be  \"high\".  The  level  of  satisfaction  with                  barangay  services  and  facilities,  as  well  as  services  and  projects  from  civil  society                 organizations (CSOs) are also  rated as  \"high\".  Managerial  efficiency  and effectiveness,  as                  well as leadership performance of the Punong Barangay [head of the village] are perceived                 positively.  Effectiveness  of  efforts  to  meet  basic  needs  and  satisfaction  of  such  needs  are                  assessed as \"moderate\", and there is the active participation of civil society in environmental                 protection efforts in the barangay. However, findings also bring to light the need for greater                 civil society participation in decision-making and development activities in the barangay, and                  for  the  Punong  Barangay  to  exercise  greater  political  will  in  the  performance  of  his/her                 official  responsibilities.  Findings  also  reveal  that  local  governance  is  positively  correlated                  with  community  development.  The  factors  of  local  governance,  i.e.  revenue  management,                 service delivery, and accountability contribute to community development specifically, the                  satisfaction of basic community needs and the protection and enhancement of environmental                 resources in the barangay. Furthermore, there is no significant difference in the operations of                  local  governance  and  community  development  across  different  income  levels  of  the                 barangay.  However,  the  protection  and  enhancement  of  environmental  resources  in  the                  barangay are higher in middle income barangay compared to the lower income barangays.                 The  study  recommends  a  systematic  and  comprehensive  human  resource  development                 program  to  provide  orientation  on  the  opportunities  and  prospects  for  good  governance                  affected  by  the  Local  Goverment  Code  of  1991  and  enhance  managerial  and  leadership","competencies  of  the  Punong  barangay.  Further  research  on  local  governance  is  also                 recommended focusing more on leadership motivations, values and ethics, and behavior as                  basis for predicting and enhancing governance performance at the local levels.

The cabeza de barangay became the punong barangay                  or the barangay captain. Making the barangay the smallest unit of government in Philippine                 politics.
