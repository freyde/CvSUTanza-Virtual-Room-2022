                       Rose B. Fabian.

                              This study was conducted to determine the online shopping personality types

                       and consumers' buying behavior in Cavite. Specifically, the study aimed to determine


                       the demographic profiles of the participants; describe the online shopping personality

                       type of consumers; identify the type of buying behavior of online shoppers; determine

                       if there is a significant difference between their personality type and buying behavior

                       when grouped according to their demographic characteristics.

                              The study followed a descriptive design. It was used to describe the online


                       shopping personality types of consumers. It was also used to identify online shoppers'

                       buying  behavior  and  determine  if  there  is  a  significant  difference  between  their

                       personality type and buying behavior when grouped according to their demographic

                       characteristics. Furthermore, the researchers used quota sampling to determine the

                       number of participants.

                       were female, and most of them were employed and had monthly incomes ranging from

                              E-retailers  can  use  the  findings  of  this  study  to  allocate  their  marketing

                       products. Future researchers will use the study as another reference or source if they

                       have the  same study  or  are  likely about the  online  shoppers'  personality type  and

                       buying behavior. Marketers can collect ideas about the typologies of online shoppers

                       and their buying behavior. Also, this study would help the psychologist to understand

                       customers' behavior with a high degree of reliability.

                                                           INTRODUCTION



                              Online shopping is an easy solution to the busy life in today's world. There has

                       been  a  massive  change  in  customers'  shopping  in  the  past  decade.  Despite

                       consumers'  continued  buying  from  a  physical  store,  the  users  or  buyers  feel  very

                       convenient  with  online  shopping.  Online  shopping  saves  crucial  time  for  modern

                       people because they get so preoccupied that they are unable or reluctant to devote


                       much time to shopping.(Rahman, 2018).

                              Consumers decide to purchase products through e-commerce. The behaviors

                       themselves — identifying a problem or deciding to make a purchase — are based on

                       ever-evolving  expectations  and  needs.  And  while  needs  look  different  for  every

                       shopper, the new expectations that drive online consumer behavior are entrenched in

                       commonality (Wenzl, 2021).

                              The extent of involvement in a purchase decision determines consumer buying


                       behavior. The most common types of buying behavior are complex buying behavior,

                       dissonance-reducing buying behavior, habitual buying behavior, and variety-seeking

                       buying behavior (Clootrack, 2021).]]></page><page Index="24"><![CDATA[2


                              There  are  different  online  shopper  personality  types  or  behavioral

                       characteristics  of  shoppers.  It  includes  adventurous  explorers,  shopping  lovers,

                       business  users,  fearful  browsers,  shopping  avoiders,  and  fun-seekers.  Each  has

                       certain traits, and skillful marketing professionals stress the importance of learning


                       each  type  to  design  attractive  shopping  services  for  members  of  every  customer

                       segment (Bajaj, 2018).

                              Statistics show that only two percent of Filipino netizens have purchased goods

                       or services online before the pandemic. Fashion apparel, athletic goods, and footwear

                       were the greatest sellers in the pre-COVID era. In the post-COVID age, a new category


                       has developed. Personal protection equipment, sanitary supplies, and consumables

                       have  all  become  hot  commodities  in  recent  years.  Consumers  have  put  off  non-

                       essential purchases due to their time spent at home (Masigan, 2020).

                              Because of the growth of e-commerce in the Philippines due to COVID-19,

                       consumers  chose  to  buy  essential  and  non-essential  goods  online.  This  research

                       describes consumers' personality types and buyers' behavior when they shop online.]]></page><page Index="25"><![CDATA[3


                       Statement of the Problem

                              The study aimed to determine the online shopping personality types and their

                       buying behavior.

                              4.  Is there a significant difference between their personality type and buying

                                 behavior when grouped according to their demographic characteristics?

                       Objectives of the Study

                              The study mainly aimed to determine the online shopping personality types

                       and their buying behavior.


                              Specifically, the study aimed to:

                              1.  determine the demographic profile of the participants in terms of;

                                     a.  age;

                                     b.  sex;

                                     c.  occupation; and


                                     d.  monthly income;

                              2.   describe the online shopping personality type of consumers;

                                 and  buying  behavior  when  grouped  according  to  their  demographic

                                 characteristics;]]></page><page Index="26"><![CDATA[4


                       Hypothesis


                              The  null  hypothesis formulated  for this  research  study  was that there  is  no

                       significant  difference  between  their  personality  type  and  buying  behavior  when

                       grouped according to their demographic characteristics. It was accepted based on the

                       result of the study


                       Conceptual Framework of the Study

                              This section presents the framework used by the researchers in presenting the

                       study. It illustrates how the concept is interrelated to achieve the study's objectives.

                       The variables being studied are online shopping personality and their buying behavior

                       on  essential  and  non-essential  goods.  According  to  Bajaj  (2018),  there  are  many

                       different online shopper personality types or behavioral characteristics of shoppers,


                       including adventurous explorers, shopping lovers, business users, fearful browsers,

                       shopping avoiders, and fun-seekers.

                              The  study's  demographic  characteristics,  age,  sex,  monthly  income,  and

                       occupation  were  determined  as  the  type  of  online  shopping  personality  and  their

                       buying  behavior.  After  identifying  those  variables,  the  researchers  described  the

                       significant difference between online shopping personality type and buying behavior


                       when grouped according to their demographic profile.

                                                                                 Behavior]]></page><page Index="27"><![CDATA[5


                       Significance of the Study


                              The study results would be beneficial to E-retailers to allocate their marketing

                       resources  better  and  create  a  more  successful  marketing  mix  for  each  of  their

                       products. Also, it will give them valuable insight into the behavioral features of each

                       consumer segment and their buying behavior.


                              Furthermore,  future  researchers  will  use  the  study  as  another  reference  or

                       source if they have the same study or likely about the online shoppers' personality type

                       and  buying  behavior.  This  research  will  give  them  an  idea  about  the typologies  of

                       online shoppers and their buying behavior because they are responsible for creating

                       an involvement chain between the customer and the product or service offered by the

                       company.


                       Time and Place of the Study

                              The  study  was  conducted  in  Cavite.  The  researcher  gathered  data  from

                       September to December 2021.

                       Scope and Limitations of the Study

                              The study focused on determining the demographic profile of the participants

                       in terms of age, sex, occupation, and monthly income, the online shoppers’ personality


                       types, and the type of their buying behavior. The online shopping personality types

                       under  study  are  adventurous  explorers,  shopping  lovers,  business  users,  fearful

                       browsers, shopping avoiders, and fun-seekers. The buying behavior types included

                       are complex buying behavior, dissonance-reducing buying behavior, habitual buying

                       behavior, and variety-seeking buying behavior.

                              The study selected participants from Cavite. The result of the study was limited

                       to the responses of consumers buying online.]]></page><page Index="28"><![CDATA[6


                       Definition of Terms

                       This section presents the terms that were used in the study:

                              Adventurous  explorers believe  online  shopping  is  fun.  They  are  likely  the

                       opinion leaders for all things online.


                              Business users use the Internet primarily for business purposes.

                              Buying behavior refers to people's decision processes and acts in buying and

                       using products.

                              Complex buying behavior occurs when the consumer is highly involved with

                       the  purchase  and  when  there  are  significant  differences  between  brands.  This


                       behavior can be associated with purchasing a new home or a personal computer.

                              Dissonance-reducing  buying  behavior occurs  when  a  consumer  buys  an

                       easily available product.

                              E-commerce refers to a business model that allows companies and individuals

                       to buy and sell goods and services over the Internet.

                              Fearful browser fears about credit card security, shipping charges, and buying

                       products sight unseen were overcome.


                              Fun seekers see the entertainment value on the Internet, but buying things

                       online frightens them.

                              Habitual buying behavior occurs when consumers buy products that they use

                       for their daily routine, they do not put a lot of thought.

                              Online shoppers are those who purchase products and services online.


                              Personality is  a  characteristic  way  of  thinking,  feeling,  and  behaving.  It

                       embraces moods, attitudes, and opinions and is most clearly expressed in interactions

                       with other people.

                              Shopping avoiders do not like to wait for products to be shipped to them, and

                       they like seeing merchandise in person before buying.

                              Shopping  lovers enjoy  buying  online  and  do  so  frequently.  They  are

                       competent computer users and will likely continue their shopping habits.]]></page><page Index="29"><![CDATA[7


                              Variety-seeking buying behavior occurs when consumers might want to try

                                                 REVIEW OF RELATED LITERATURE



                              This  section  contains  different  articles  that  are  used  to  support  the

                       conceptualization  of  the  study.  It  also  includes  relevant  studies  that  support  and


                       contribute in the development of the study.

                       Online Shopping During Pandemic

                              In  the  past,  consumers  around  the  world  had  been  more  skeptical  about

                       shopping  online;  however,  with  time,  that  sentiment  has  decreased  considerably,

                       especially during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.


                               In  2020,  over  80  percent  of  consumers  across  the  globe  shopped  online:

                       reaching nearly 90 percent each; the leading regions that year were South America

                       and Asia. North America had the lowest share, with just over three in four consumers

                       buying  items  on  the  internet.  The  online  store  that  was  used  most  frequently  by

                       shoppers worldwide was Amazon.com. Retail e-commerce sales worldwide amounted

                       to 4.28 trillion US dollars, and e-retail revenues are projected to grow to 5.4 trillion US

                       dollars in 2022. Online shopping is one of the most popular online activities worldwide.


                              According to Campos (n.d.), as cited by Masigan (2020), 91 percent of Filipino

                       internet  users  searched  for  goods  and  services  to  purchase  during  the  quarantine

                       period. Of all those who searched, 76 percent consummated the transaction. This is a

                       clear  indication  that  Filipinos  are  finally  warming  up  to  e-commerce.  From  a  sales

                       turnover of $500 million in 2015, e-commerce in the Philippines is seen to top $12


                       billion by the year 2025. It already realized $3 billion in 2019. In the first six months of

                       2020, growth has already doubled in terms of the number of buyers and the peso value

                       of purchases compared to 2019.

                              A survey conducted by Global Web (2020) shows that 48 percent of Filipinos

                       plan to do more online shopping after the pandemic is over. During the pre-COVID era,

                       fashion apparel, sporting goods, and footwear were the best sellers at 54 percent, 18

                       percent, and 10 percent of the sales mix. A new category has emerged in the post-]]></page><page Index="31"><![CDATA[9


                       COVID era. Nowadays, essentials that include personal protective equipment, sanitary

                       goods, and groceries have emerged as brisk sellers.

                                  Time  spent  at  home  has  caused  consumers  to  delay  any  non-essential

                       purchases. This has led to pent-up demand. A recent survey indicates that when the


                       Filipinos  are  able,  they  will  prioritize  purchasing  clothing  at  19  percent,  home

                       appliances and devices at 18 percent, home furniture and accessories at 15 percent,

                       electronic gadgets at 15 percent, and smartphones at 11 percent.

                                   According  to  a  survey  conducted  by  Rakuten  Insight,  41  percent  of  the

                       respondents stated they purchased more online during the COVID-19 pandemic in the


                       Philippines as of May 2020. In contrast, only 20 percent said they did not make online

                       purchases (Statista Research Department, 2021).

                              The pandemic has changed the focus to the top priority of better health. That

                       is why consumers' thoughts have changed toward the basic needs, increasing the

                       demand for hygiene, staples, and cleaning products while decreasing the order for

                       non-essential  categories.  For  the  consumers,  the  top  priority  is  personal  health,

                       followed by that of family and friends. Financial security, food, personal safety, and


                       medical security are other priorities. People focus on products with health defense

                       benefits on beverage and food products, especially those with immunity benefits and

                       natural products. Given this is an unpredictable period, we are uncertain about the

                       economic future. Thus, many consumers are concentrating on their short-term and

                       primary needs. During crises, consumers tend to focus on goods and services at low


                       prices, requiring a tangible reason to go for more expensive ones (Bohlen, Carlotti &

                       Mihas, n.d.as cited by Sharma, 2020).

                              Due to the sudden outbreak of COVID-19, e-commerce platforms saw a surge

                       in their activities as people actively resorted to online buying of the respondents who

                       have  purchased  essential  goods  from  online  platforms  mainly  due  to  the  COVID

                       outbreak. Groceries and hygiene products were given preference over luxury products

                       during  the  pandemic  of  the  population  purchased  groceries  and  59.5  purchased]]></page><page Index="32"><![CDATA[10


                       hygiene products online, while 31 of the population purchased clothing apparel and

                       16.8 purchased ready-made food items from various online platforms. Hygiene and

                       health were the most important things to be maintained during the pandemic to avoid

                       infection. People were seen shifting their online platforms due to scarcity of goods on


                       their preferred platforms and trust and hygiene maintenance issues. Respondents will

                       be ready to shift the platforms due to scarcity of products, 17 claimed to be loyal to

                       their daily online platforms, and 48 were still confused. (Salunke P. 2020)

                              According to the study of Laguna (2020), changes in the popularity of searches

                       related  to  food  were  observed  during  the  lockdown  period.  People's  interest  in


                       restaurants decreased, and interest in recipes and delivery reached huge popularity,

                       comparable  or  higher  than  searches  related  to  health  (symptoms  and  spread).

                       People's concerns about diet decreased, but the interest in food products like flour,

                       bread, fruits, milk, and chicken (related to cooking, baking, and storage conditions)

                       increased.

                              Geographically,  38  percent  of  all  e-commerce  transactions  occur  in  Metro

                       Manila,  nine  percent  in  Cavite  and  Laguna,  six  percent  in  Cebu,  six  percent  in


                       Pampanga  and  Bulacan,  three  percent  in  Davao,  and  three  percent  in  Rizal,  two

                       percent in Iloilo, and two percent in Batangas. The rest of the regions are too small to

                       be categorized. Cash on delivery is still the preferred mode of payment, comprising 67

                       percent of all transactions. Credit cards follow this at 24 percent. Paypal has a five

                       percent  share  of  payment  transactions,  while  G-Cash  has  a  two  percent  share.  A


                       massive  79  percent  of  all  e-commerce  transactions  are  consummated  over  the

                       smartphone (Masigan, 2020).

                       Demographics Characteristics of Online Shoppers

                              The Philippine population of 110.3 million people skews towards a young, tech-

                       savvy group of Millennial and Gen Z consumers (the country's average age is 25.7

                       years). Unsurprisingly, these consumers are prolific users of the Internet, spending an

                       average of 10 hours and 56 minutes2 browsing the Internet each day. Nearly half of]]></page><page Index="33"><![CDATA[11


                       that time—4 hours and 15 minutes—is spent on social media. Like other countries in

                       Southeast Asia, the advent of powerful and affordable mobile devices is at the heart of

                       this surge of Internet usage among Filipinos. The Philippines has been a mobile-first

                       nation since 2014, and this can be seen in Hootsuite, and We Are Social's findings that


                       98.5 percent of adult Filipinos use mobile phones of any type. In contrast, only 77.3

                       percent have a laptop or desktop computer (Bahasa & Leong, 2019).

                              Filipinos shop online to find products not found locally or in brick-and-mortar

                       stores. Social media listening will go a long way towards understanding the unmet

                       needs of Filipino online shoppers. (Benedict, 2021)


                              Benedict (2019) reveals that 67 percent (73.91 million) of the country's total

                       population of 107.3 million people are active Internet users. 38.88 million. Based on

                       the same report, people in the Philippines have purchased a product or service online.

                       25 to 34-year-olds, followed by 16 to 24-year-olds, shop at least 3 to 6 times a week.

                       These groups are more likely to shop online every day than all the age groups. More

                       women (11.5 percent) shop online than men (8.2 percent), even if fewer women have

                       credit cards. Cash on Delivery is still the preferred payment method in the Philippines,


                       with  71  percent  of  the  Philippines'  population  being  unbanked.  The  increase  in  e-

                       commerce adoption was nationwide and not limited to urban areas.

                              In terms of demographics, 72 percent of Filipino online shoppers are female,

                       while 28 percent are male. Age-wise, 45 percent are between 25 to 35 years old, 22

                       percent are between 18 to 24 years old, 16 percent are between 35 to 44 years old,


                       and 17 percent are 45 years old or older (Masigan, 2020).

                                  According  to  Goldring  and  Azab  (2020),  the  study  compares  differences  in

                       market mavens between two generations: the young adult portion of Gen Z, born from

                       approximately 1997 through 2012, to their Gen X parents, taken from 1965 through

                       1980,  using  a  field  study  of  traits,  shopping  habits,  and  social  media  behaviors.

                       Building  on  generational  cohort  theory  conducted  paired  comparisons  across

                       generations  and  in  mavens  versus  non-mavens.  They  found  differences  between]]></page><page Index="34"><![CDATA[12


                       mavens  and  non-mavens  related  to  value  consciousness,  marketplace  interfaces,

                       status  consumption,  need  for  uniqueness,  and  social  outcomes  decision  making.

                       Significant differences were also found between Ganz's and GenX's mavens regarding

                       status consumption and social outcomes decision making. We also analyzed social


                       media  engagement  by  product  category  and  platform  and  suggested  managerial

                       implications.

                              According to the study by Kiyuci (2012), the Internet is an essential facilitator

                       for humans. Humans use this medium in almost every phase as a shopping medium;

                       the Internet attracts humans, attracting researchers. In this research, younger people


                       can adopt newer technologies to adapt to the Internet as a shopping tool. It is tried to

                       define college of education students' online shopping behavior and online shopping

                       activities; research results show that male students are more familiar and have a more

                       positive  attitude  than  female  students.  Teacher  students  who  have  more  monthly

                       income and have more internet self-efficacy have a positive attitude and intention to

                       shop online. Participants with credit cards have no more familiarity and less anxiety

                       concerning internet shopping.


                       Consumer Typologies

                              Consumer typologies classify heterogeneous populations into meaningful and

                       distinct subgroups (Lee, Kim, & Lee, 2013). From a marketing perspective, consumer

                       typologies provide a basis for more precise and effective segmentation, targeting, and

                       positioning strategies (Yankelovich & Meer, 2006).


                              According  to  Teodorescu  et  al  (2008),  the  typology  of  buyers  and  buying

                       actions  contracts  are  specific  categories  of  consumer  behavior,  determining  group

                       buyers and buying actions in classes, to fragment the markets. Market fragmentation

                       through buyer typology and/or segmentation is presently characterized by a multitude

                       of theoretical approaches and are especially generated by the common practice in the

                       respective business. These two concepts are used for the same purpose, the essential

                       difference  being  their  starting  point:  the  segmentation  fragments  the  markets  as  a]]></page><page Index="35"><![CDATA[13


                       whole, while the typology of the buyer and of buying actions generate classifications

                       starting from individual cases.

                              There  are  many  different  online  shopper  personality  types,  or  behavioral

                       characteristics of shoppers. Each has certain traits, and skillful marketing professionals


                       stress the importance of learning each type in order to design a shopping services that

                       are attractive to members of each type or customer segment (Bajaj, 2018). Here are

                       some of the online shopping personality types:

                              Adventurous explorers.  Adventurous explorers, (30% of online spending)

                       are  a  small  segment  that  presents  a  large  opportunity.  They  require  little  special


                       attention by Internet vendors because retailers should nurture and cultivate them to be

                       online community builders and shopping advocates.

                              Shopping  lovers.  Shopping  lovers,  (24%  of  online  spending)  enjoy  buying

                       online  and  do  so  frequently.  They  are  competent  computer  users  and  will  likely

                       continue their shopping habits. They also spread the word to others about joys of online

                       shopping  whenever  they  have  the  opportunity.  They  represent  an  ideal  target  for

                       retailers.


                              Business users. Business users, (19% of online spending) are among the

                       most computer literate. They use the Internet primarily for business purposes. They

                       take a serious interest in what it can do for their professional life. They don’t view online

                       shopping as novel and aren’t usually champions of the practice.


                              Fearful browsers. Fearful browsers, (5% of online spending) are on the cusp

                       of buying online. They are capable Internet and computer users, spending a good deal

                       of time “window shopping.” They could become a significant buying group if their fears

                       about credit card security, shipping charges and buying products sight unseen were


                       overcome.

                              Shopping  avoiders.  Shopping  avoiders,  (3%  of  online  spending)  have  an

                       appealing income level, but their values make them a poor target for online retailers.]]></page><page Index="36"><![CDATA[14


                       They  don’t  like  to  wait  for  products  to  be  shipped  to  them  and  they  like  seeing

                       merchandise in person before buying. They have online shopping issues that retailers

                       will not easily be able to overcome.

                              Fun seekers. Fun seekers, (2% of online spending) are the least wealthy and


                       least  educated market  segment.  They  see  entertainment value  in  the  Internet,  but

                       buying things online frightens them. Although security and privacy issues might be

                       overcome, the spending power of the segment suggests that only a marginal long-term

                       payback would be possible (Bajaj, 2018).

                              According to Bajaj (2018), many consumers (online) have different traits and


                       habits. Since every industry dynamic are different, so are the consumer habits.

                              Meanwhile, Brophy and Hodge (2021) identified eight types of shoppers on

                       physical stores.

                              The bargain hunter. Most retailers regularly encounter bargain hunters in their

                       shops. Also called discount shoppers, bargain hunters are usually armed with coupons

                       or discount codes, know when all of the best sales are, and rarely buy without some

                       sort of deal in hand.


                              Whereas some shoppers are looking for something sentimental, the bargain

                       hunter’s  purchase  will  be  primarily  determined  by  price  and  a  sense  that  they  are

                       saving money. The bargain hunters need sales and deals.

                              The browser. Browsing customers, sometimes called wandering customers,

                       are shoppers who are not looking for a particular item or to purchase from a specific


                       location. They happened to come across your store and are curious as to what you

                       have to offer. The browsing customer is motivated to make a purchase based on an

                       experience or a connection.

                              The showrooming customers. This type of shopping is particularly popular

                       among  people  in  the  market  for  furniture,  appliances,  or  other  large,  expensive

                       products that are supposed to last. While large companies like Ikea have molded their

                       entire  business  model  on  the  show  rooming  customer,  show  rooming  can  be]]></page><page Index="37"><![CDATA[15


                       problematic for small businesses because often, shoppers will view your product only

                       to purchase it from another retailer at a lower price. If you can give the show rooming

                       customer’s  peace  of  mind  and  simplify  their  shopping  process,  you  will  meet  their

                       needs and convert them into an in-store sale.


                              The impulse shoppers. Impulse shoppers make unplanned purchases based

                       on items that appeal to them in the moment. I am sure that you have been in line at

                       the grocery store or convenience shop and have grabbed a pack of chips at checkout.

                       That is an impulse buy. Typically, impulse shopping is often buying small items that

                       catch people’s attention.


                              The  mission-driven  shopper.  Mission-driven  buyers  are  on  the  hunt  for

                       particular products or are shopping from a list. They are even sometimes called “list

                       shoppers” because they so often come with a physical litany of things they want to

                       buy. Others have termed them “need-based” and “reluctant” shoppers because, for

                       them,  buying  is  driven  strictly  by  need  and  not  because  they  necessarily  enjoy

                       shopping.

                              The indecisive patron. Indecisive shoppers are looking to make a purchase


                       but  are  reluctant  or  hesitant  to  do  so  because  of  price,  information  overload,  or

                       insufficient information. I know I ran into this type of shopper all the time at my store.

                       They would try things on, but struggle to make a decision and constantly make excuses

                       as to why they shouldn’t buy the piece.

                              The educated consumer. The educated shopper researches products or a


                       store’s  inventory  online,  reads  customer  reviews,  and  scans  general  pricing

                       information before visiting the store. They also typically have an idea of what they want

                       to buy by the time they make it in.

                              The  loyal  customer.  Loyal  customers,  or  regular  customers,  are  every

                       retailer’s  favorite.  The  loyal  customer  is  someone  who  visits  your  shop  often  and

                       makes regular purchases. You might even know them by name and have a rapport

                       with them (Brophy & Hodge, 2021).]]></page><page Index="38"><![CDATA[16


                              According  to  Gautam  and  Prasad  (2019),  develops  a  typology  based  upon

                       motivations for online shopping. They identified the types of online shoppers labeled

                       as  fear  shoppers,  convenience  shoppers,  novice  seekers,  trusted  buyers  and

                       traditional  shoppers.  The  fear  shoppers  worried  about  their  security  and  privacy


                       concern. The convenience shoppers are more motivated by convenience. The novice

                       seekers  are  substantially  more  motivated  by  information  seeking  across  retail

                       alternatives. Trusted buyers are moderately motivated by quality and variety seeking.

                       The traditional shoppers are more motivated by physical store orientation.


                       Consumer Buying Behavior

                              Consumer buying behavior refers to consumers' actions taken (both on and

                       offline) before buying a product or service. This process may include consulting search


                       engines, engaging with social media posts, or various other actions. It is valuable for

                       businesses to understand this process because it helps companies better tailor their

                       marketing  initiatives  to  the  marketing  efforts  that  have  successfully  influenced

                       consumers to buy in the past (JD, TEAM 2020).

                                  A consumer's buying decision depends on the products they need to buy. A

                       consumer's behavior while buying a coffee is different from while purchasing a car.


                       Based on observations, it is clear that more complex and expensive purchases involve

                       higher deliberation and many more participants.

                                  Consumer  buying  behavior  is  determined  by  the  level  of  involvement  in  a

                       purchase decision. The amount of risk involved in purchase also determines the buying

                       behavior.  Higher-priced  goods  tend  to  have  a  higher  risk,  thereby  seeking  higher

                       involvement in buying decisions. The following are the types of purchasing behavior.

                              Complex  buying  behavior.  Complex  buying  behavior  is  encountered


                       particularly  when  consumers  are  buying  an  expensive  product.  In  this  infrequent

                       transaction, consumers are highly involved in the purchase decision. Consumers will

                       research thoroughly before committing to invest.]]></page><page Index="39"><![CDATA[17


                              Consumer  behaves  very  different  when  buying  an  expensive  product  or  a

                       product that is unfamiliar to him. When the risk of buying a product is very high, a

                       consumer consults friends, family, and experts before making the decision.

                              For  example,  when  a  consumer  is  buying  a  car  for  the first  time,  it’s  a  big


                       decision as it involves high economic risk. There is a lot of thought on how it looks,

                       how his/her friends and family will react, how will his/her social status change after

                       buying the car, and so on.

                              In complex buying behavior, the buyer will pass through a learning process. He

                       will first develop beliefs about the product, then attitudes, and then making a thoughtful


                       purchase choice.

                              For  complex  buying  behavior  customers,  marketers  should  have  a  deep

                       understanding  of  the  products.  It  is  expected  that  they  help  the  consumer  to

                       understand about their product. It is important to create advertising message in a way

                       that influences the buyer’s beliefs and attitudes.

                              Dissonance-reducing  buying  behavior.  In  dissonance-reducing  buying

                       behavior  consumer  involvement  is  very  high.  This  might  be  due  to  high  price  and


                       infrequent  purchase.  In  addition,  there  is  a  low  availability  of  choices with  less

                       significance differences among brands. In this type, a consumer buys a product that is

                       easily available.

                              Consumers will be forced to buy goods that do not have too many choices and

                       therefore consumers will be left with limited decision making. Based on the products


                       available,  time  limitation  or  the  budget  limitation,  consumers  buy  certain  products

                       without a lot of research.

                              For example, a consumer who is looking for a new collapsible table that can be

                       taken for a camping, quickly decides on the product based on few brands available.

                       The main criteria here will be the use and the feature of the collapsible table and the

                       budget available with him.]]></page><page Index="40"><![CDATA[18


                              Marketers  should  run  after-sale  service  camps  that  deliver  focused

                       messaging.  These campaigns should aim to support consumers and convince them

                       to continue with their choice of their brand. These marketing campaigns should focus

                       on building repeat purchases and referrals by offering discounts and incentives.


                              Habitual  buying  behavior.  Habitual  buying  behavior is  depicted  when  a

                       consumer has low involvement in a purchase decision. In this case the consumer is

                       perceiving only a few significant differences between brands.

                              When consumers are buying products that they use for their daily routine, they

                       do not put a lot of thought. They either buy their favorite brand or the one that they use


                       regularly – or the one available in the store or the one that costs the least.

                              For example, while a consumer buys a loaf of bread, he tends to buy the brand

                       that he is familiar with without actually putting a lot of research and time. Many products

                       fit into this category. Everyday use products, such as salt, sugar, biscuits, toilet paper,

                       and black pepper all fit into this product category.

                              Consumer just go for it and buy it – there is no brand loyalty. Consumers do

                       not research or need information regarding purchase of such products.


                              Habitual  buying  behavior  is  influenced  by  radio,  television  and  print  media.

                       Moreover, consumers are buying based on brand familiarity. Hence marketers must

                       use repetitive advertisements to build brand familiarity. Further to initiate product trial,

                       marketers should use tactics like price drop promotions and sales promotions.

                              Marketers should attract consumers using visual symbols and imagery in their


                       advertising. Consumers can easily remember visual advertisements and can associate

                       with a brand.

                              Variety  seeking  buying  behavior.  In  variety  seeking  consumer  behavior,

                       consumer involvement is low. There are significant differences between brands. Here

                       consumers often do a lot of brand switching. The cost of switching products is low, and

                       hence  consumers  might  want  to  try  out  new  products  just  out  of  curiosity  or]]></page><page Index="41"><![CDATA[19


                       boredom. Consumers  here,  generally  buy  different  products  not  because  of

                       dissatisfaction but mainly with an urge to seek variety.

                              For example, a consumer likes to buy a cookie and choose a brand without

                       putting much thought to it. Next time, the same consumer might may choose a different


                       brand out of a wish for a different taste. Brand switching occurs often and without

                       intention.

                              Brands have to adopt different strategies for such type of consumer behavior.

                       The  market  leader  will  persuade  habitual  buying  behavior  by  influencing  the  shelf

                       space. The shelf will display a large number of related but different product versions.


                              Marketers  avoid  out-of-stock  conditions,  sponsor  frequent  advertising,  offer

                       lower  prices,  discounts,  deals,  coupons  and  free  samples  to attract consumers.

                       (Clootrack, 2021).

                       Consumer Buying Behavior towards Online Shopping

                              Today’s  online  consumers  have  more  control  and  bargaining  power  than

                       consumers  of  conventional  stores  because  the  Internet  offers  more  interaction

                       between  customers  and  products/service  providers  and  greater  availability  of


                       information  about  products  and  services.  The  Internet  has  fundamentally  changed

                       customers’  notions  of  convenience,  speed,  price,  product  information,  and  service

                       (Patro, 2018).

                              Online  shopping  has  unique  characteristics,  emphasizing  that  the  lack  of

                       physical interaction tends to be the critical impediment in online retail sales, followed


                       by the privacy of individual information and security of financial transactions over the

                       Internet (Esha, Sultana & Molnar, 2018).

                              Consumer attitudes toward online shopping usually been determined by two


                       factors; one is trust, and another is perceived benefits. Therefore, trust and perceived

                       benefits  seem  to  be  the  critical  conjectures  of  consumer  behavior  toward  online

                       shopping (Sultana & Chakravorty, 2018).]]></page><page Index="42"><![CDATA[20


                       Also, demographic variables such as age, gender, and income level play a facilitating

                       role because they influence consumer perception and consumer behavior that drives

                       them towards online shopping (Molnar, 2018).

                              Huseynov and Yıldırım (2014) emphasized that the lack of physical interaction


                       tends to be the critical impediment in online retail sales, followed by the privacy of

                       individual  information  and  security  of  financial  transactions  over  the  Internet.

                       Demangeot and Broderick (2016) also revealed that perceived ease of use does not

                       affect the behavioral pattern but is rather influenced by security and privacy issues. No

                       relationship  is  built  between  the  customer  and  the  online  shop  in  the  presence  of


                       perceived online risk, even if a customer spent hours on the Internet (Zuroni & Goh,

                       2012).

                              Day-by-day tastes, preferences, and choices vary regarding different factors

                       such as Internet emergence. However, this development needs more understanding

                       of the consumer’s behavior. Consumer behavior research identifies a general model

                       of  buying  behavior  that  depicts  the  processes  used  by  consumers  in  making  a

                       purchase decision (Vrender, 2016). Those designs are paramount to the marketer as


                       they  can  explain  and  predict  consumer  purchase  behavior.  Jarvenpaa  and  Todd

                       (1997) proposed a model of general attitude, behavior, and shopping intention towards

                       Internet shopping. The design includes several indicators classified into four broad

                       categories: product value, quality services offered through the website, the shopping

                       experience, and the risk perception of online shopping.


                              Chang, Cheung, and Lai (2016) studied categories of variables that drive online

                       shopping activity. In their study, they divided the features into three broad categories.

                       Perceived characteristics of the web sale channel are the first one which includes risk,

                       online shopping experiences, advantage, service quality, and trust.

                              The  second  category  is  a  website  and  product  features:  risk  reduction

                       measures, site features, and product characteristics; and the last group is consumer

                       characteristics.  Various  features,  demographic  variables,  consumer  shopping]]></page><page Index="43"><![CDATA[21


                       orientations, consumer innovativeness and psychological variables, computer, Internet

                       knowledge, and usages drive consumer characteristics. Consumer attitudes toward

                       online shopping usually been determined by two factors; one is trust, and another is

                       perceived  benefits  (Hoque,  Ali,  &  Mahfuz,  2016).  Therefore,  trust  and  perceived


                       benefits  seem  to  be  the  critical  conjectures  of  consumer  behavior  toward  online

                       shopping  (Al-Debei,  Akroush,  &  Ashouri,  2016;  Hajli,  2017).  Moreover,  information

                       quality,  merchandise  attribute,  website  design,  transaction  capability,  payment,

                       security/privacy,  delivery,  self-consciousness,  state  of  mind,  the  consumer’s  time

                       sense,  and  customer  service  are  strongly  predictive  of  online,  Rahman  Cogent


                       Business & Management (2018).

                              Time-saving  and  available  varieties  of  products  are  the  main  grounds  for

                       shopping online. All these four factors motivate an online shopper to buy over the

                       Internet.  Therefore,  companies  should  design  strategies  and  develop  varieties  of

                       products to attract and retain online shoppers. This finding also confirms the findings

                       of Gong (2013) and Hoque et al. (2015), where the respondents found to adopt e-

                       commerce for its usefulness.


                              According to Kaemingk (2020), like it or not, in the confusing and busy world of

                       online  shopping,  people  want  reassurance  before  committing  to  a  purchase.  Your

                       potential customers are turning to online review sites to learn all about your service or

                       product. Sites like Yelp, Google Maps, and TripAdvisor allow customers to give advice

                       or to read past customer experiences directly from the source. How powerful is this


                       route to market on customer buying decisions? The answer is very. 91% of 18-34-

                       year-olds trust online reviews as much as personal recommendations, and 93% of

                       consumers say that online reviews influence their purchase decisions.

                              Online reviews give power to the customers to tell their side of the buying story.

                       This provides social proof to other potential customers. Social proof is the level of

                       credibility that the public offers to a service or product. The more people who use or

                       enjoy a product, the more likely others are to follow. Positive public endorsement of a]]></page><page Index="44"><![CDATA[22


                       brand by a celebrity can provide high social proof, directly impacting sales. Likewise,

                       a negative review can drive customers away. There’s also evidence to suggest that

                       online  reviews  are  the  primary  way  to  choose  where  to  shop  locally.  Nearly  all

                       consumers (97%) now use online media when researching products or services in their


                       local area.

                       Spending Habits

                              According to Bump (2021), most consumers were more conscientious about

                       purchases  than  before  the  pandemic.  Because  of  this,  most  households  primarily

                       budgeted  around  essential  products  and  services.  As  businesses  and  economies


                       closed down due to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, consumers also tightened up

                       their budgets. When someone is on a tight budget, each dollar they spend has to be

                       worth  it.  This means that the  products  or  services  they  buy  have  to  help  them  do

                       something essential, solve a common pain point, save them time or money, or fulfill

                       other major needs.

                              Consumers  sometimes  see  low  prices  as  simply  good  deals.  Shoppers’

                       perceptions of a low price depend on what they’re thinking about when deciding to buy


                       a product. Younger generations are also more likely to be price conscious and to price

                       compare, as over half of those two age segments report they are annoyed when they

                       can find products they want for lower prices elsewhere. While 18-29 year olds and 30-

                       44 year olds are fairly aligned on getting products at lower prices and getting irrelevant

                       offers, the 30-44 year old group is not nearly as sold on finding the best price at the


                       expense of finding unique products (Baird, 2019).

                              According  to  Glover  (2021),  many  best  practices  and  marketing  tactics

                       encourage natural word of mouth, but campaigns — particularly on social media —

                       can have the explicit aim of promoting an online business’ social exposure. 92 percent

                       Factors that Influence Buying Behavior


                          Consumer behavior is influenced by many different factors. A marketer should try

                       to understand the factors that influence consumer behavior.

                          Psychological factors. Human psychology is a major determinant of consumer

                       behavior. These factors are difficult to measure but are powerful enough to influence

                       a buying decision. Some of the important psychological factors are:


                          Motivation. When a person is motivated enough, it influences the buying behavior

                       of  the  person.  A  person  has  many  needs  such  as  the  social  needs,  basic  needs,

                       security needs, esteem needs and self-actualization needs. Out of all these needs, the

                       basic needs and security needs take a position above all other needs. Hence basic

                       needs and security needs have the power to motivate a consumer to buy products and

                       services.

                          Perception.  Consumer  perception is  a  major  factor  that  influences  consumer


                       behavior. It is a process where a customer collects information about a product and

                       interprets the information to make a meaningful image about a particular product.

                          When  a  customer  sees  advertisements,  promotions,  customer  reviews,  social

                       media feedback relating to a product, they develop an impression about the product.

                       Hence  consumer  perception  becomes  a  great  influence  on  the  buying  decision  of


                       consumers.

                          Learning. When a person buys a product, he/she gets to learn something more

                       about  the  product.  Learning  comes  over  a  period  of  time  through  experience.  A

                       consumer’s learning depends on skills and knowledge. While a skill can be gained

                       through practice, knowledge can be acquired only through experience.]]></page><page Index="46"><![CDATA[24


                          Attitudes  and  beliefs.  Consumers  have  certain  attitude  and  beliefs  which

                       influence the buying decisions of a consumer. Based on this attitude, the consumer

                       behaves in a particular way towards a product.

                          Social factors. Humans are social beings and they live around many people who


                       influence their buying behavior. Human try to imitate other humans and also wish to

                       be socially accepted in the society. Hence their buying behavior is influenced by other

                       people around them. These factors are considered as social factors. Some of the social

                       factors are:

                          Family. Family plays a significant role in shaping the buying behavior of a person.


                       A person develops preferences from his childhood by watching family buy products

                       and continues to buy the same products even when they grow up.

                          Reference groups. Reference group is a group of people with whom a person

                       associates  himself. Generally,  all  the  people  in the  reference  group  have  common

                       buying behavior and influence each other.

                          Roles and status.  A person is influenced by the role that he holds in the society.

                       If a person is in a high position, his buying behavior will be influenced largely by his


                       status.

                          Cultural  factors.  A  group  of  people  are  associated  with  a  set  of  values  and

                       ideologies  that  belong  to  a  particular  community.  When  a  person  comes  from  a

                       particular community, his/her behavior is highly influenced by the culture relating to

                       that particular community. Some of the cultural factors are:


                          Culture.  Cultural  factors  have  strong  influence  on  consumer  buyer

                       behavior.   Cultural  factors  include  the  basic  values,  needs,  wants,  preferences,

                       perceptions, and behaviors that are observed and learned by a consumer from their

                       near family members and other important people around them.

                          Subculture.  Within  a  cultural  group,  there  exists  many  subcultures.  These

                       subcultural groups share the same set of beliefs and values. Subcultures can consist]]></page><page Index="47"><![CDATA[25


                       of  people  from  different  religion,  caste,  geographies  and  nationalities.  These

                       subcultures by itself form a customer segment.

                          Social class. Each and every society across the globe has form of social class.

                       The social class is not just determined by the income, but also other factors such as


                       the occupation, family background, education, and residence location. Social class is

                       important to predict the consumer behavior.

                          Personal  factors.  Factors  that  are  personal  to  the  consumers  influence  their

                       buying  behavior.  These  personal  factors  differ  from  person  to  person,  thereby

                       producing different perceptions and consumer behavior. Some of the personal factors


                       are:

                          Age. Age is a major factor that influences buying behavior. The buying choices of

                       youth differ from that of middle-aged people. Elderly people have a totally different

                       buying  behavior.  Teenagers  will  be  more  interested  in  buying  colorful  clothes  and

                       beauty  products.  Middle-aged  are  focused  on  house,  property  and  vehicle  for  the

                       family.

                          Income. Income has the ability to influence the buying behavior of a person. Higher


                       income gives higher purchasing power to consumers. When a consumer has higher

                       disposable income, it gives more opportunity for the consumer to spend on luxurious

                       products.  Whereas  low-income  or  middle-income  group  consumers  spend  most  of

                       their income on basic needs such as groceries and clothes.

                          Occupation. Occupation of a consumer influences the buying behavior. A person


                       tends to buy things that are appropriate to this/her profession. For example, a doctor

                       would buy clothes according to this profession while a professor will have different

                       buying pattern.

                          Lifestyle.  Lifestyle  is  an  attitude,  and  a  way  in which  an  individual  stay  in  the

                       society. The buying behavior is highly influenced by the lifestyle of a consumer. For

                       example when a consumer leads a healthy lifestyle, then the products he buys will

                       relate to healthy alternatives to junk food.]]></page><page Index="48"><![CDATA[26


                          Economic factors. The consumer buying habits and decisions greatly depend on

                       the economic situation of a country or a market. It bear a significant influence on the

                       buying decision of a consumer. Some of the important economic factors are:

                          Personal income. When a person has a higher disposable income, the purchasing


                       power increases simultaneously. Disposable income refers to the money

                          Family income. Family income is the total income from all the members of a family.

                       When  more  people  are  earning  in  the  family,  there  is  more  income  available  for

                       shopping basic needs and luxuries. Higher family income influences the people in the

                       family  to  buy  more.  When  there  is  a  surplus  income  available  for  the  family,  the


                       tendency is to buy more luxury items which otherwise a person might not have been

                       able to buy.

                          Consumer credit. When a consumer is offered easy credit to purchase goods, it

                       promotes higher spending. Sellers are making it easy for the consumers to avail credit

                       in the form of credit cards, easy installments, bank loans, hire purchase, and many

                       such  other  credit  options.  When  there  is  higher  credit  available  to  consumers,  the

                       purchase of comfort and luxury items increases.


                          Liquid assets. Consumers who have liquid assets tend to spend more on comfort

                       and luxuries. Liquid assets are those assets, which can be converted into cash very

                       easily. Cash in hand, bank savings and securities are some examples of liquid assets.

                       When a consumer has higher liquid assets, it gives him more confidence to buy luxury

                       goods.


                          Savings. A consumer is highly influenced by the amount of savings he/she wishes

                       to set aside from his income. If a consumer decided to save more, then his expenditure

                       on buying reduces. Whereas if a consumer is interested in saving more, then most of

                       his income will go towards buying products. (Clootrack, 2021).

                              According to the study of Vidyapeetham (2018), it was identified that the five

                       factors, quality product, product price, brand name, product packaging and advertising

                       have greater impact on customer buying decision. Consumers go through the rigorous]]></page><page Index="49"><![CDATA[27


                       thought processing making their buying decisions, since there are alternative products

                       which compete in the areas close proximity, relatively cheaper price, quality, brand,

                       quality and price are one among the strong competing factors in the decision making

                       process. When it comes to beauty products, it is even more intense that all the five


                       factors play a major role in consumer buying decision. Manufacturers and retailers of

                       beauty products must have this thought at the back of their mind as they embark on

                       the marketing of their products (Flores & Castaño 2020).

                       Synthesis of Related Literature and Studies

                              According to Clootrack (2021), a consumer's buying decision depends on the


                       types of products that they need to buy. The behavior of a consumer while buying a

                       coffee is a lot different from while purchasing a car. Meanwhile, learning the personality

                       type is important for marketers in designing shopping services that are attractive to

                       each type (Bajaj, 2018; Teoderescu et al., 2008).

                              Because  of  the  pandemic,  Filipinos  have  increased  their  shopping  online

                       (Campos,  n.d.  as  cited  by  Masigan,  2020;  Global  Web,  2020;  Statistica  Research

                       Department, 2021). This sudden change engaged the researchers to study consumers'


                       buying behavior and personality type when buying online.

                              In terms of demographics, 72 percent of Filipino online shoppers are female,

                       while 28 percent are male. Age-wise, 45 percent are between 25 to 35 years old, 22

                       percent are between 18 to 24 years old, 16 percent are between 35 to 44 years old,

                       and 17 percent are 45 years old or older (Masigan, 2018). This became the basis of


                       the sampling technique used by the researchers as they divided their sample according

                       to the age/generation they belonged to. They also wanted to determine if there is a

                       significant  difference  in  the  personality  type  and  buying  behavior  in  terms  of  their

                       demographic profile.]]></page><page Index="50"><![CDATA[28

                              This chapter presents the research design and the sampling techniques used

                       in  selecting  the  participants  of  the  study.  It  also  presents  the  data  gathering


                       procedures, the data analysis and the statistical treatment to be employed to achieve

                       the objectives of the study.

                       Research Design

                              The study used descriptive design. The study focused mainly on describing the

                       online shoppers’ personality types and their buying behavior.


                       Participants of the Study

                               The participants of the study are online shoppers. The data were gathered

                       from the responses of the participants in Cavite.

                       Sampling Technique

                              The  researchers  used  the  quota  sampling  technique.  A  questionnaire  was

                       developed to be used in this study. It is a structured questionnaire made up of several

                       statements which will determine the online shoppers in Cavite. Two hundred (200)


                       online  shoppers  answered  the  questionnaire.  Before  the  actual  distribution  of  the

                       instrument, the developed questionnaire was pre-tested on online shoppers in Cavite.

                       They were not part of the study to determine its validity and reliability. Once the validity

                       and reliability were established, this was sent to the selected online shoppers in Cavite,

                       wherein  35  percent  are  18-24  years  old,  50  percent  are  25-40  years  old,  and  15


                       percent are 41-56 years old. Simultaneously, each participant was contacted through

                       any communication forms available such as, but not limited to, texts, social media sites,

                       and emails.

                              Demographic  profile.  The  study  determined  the  participants'  demographic

                       profile, such as age, sex, occupation, and monthly income.

                                  The online shopping personality type of consumers. The study looked into

                       the  different  personalities  of  buyers  when  purchasing  online.  This  section  of  the

                               A conversion table using the Likert scale was used to determine the online


                       shopping  personality  types  and  consumers'  buying  behavior.  It  was  also  used  to

                       such as frequency counts, percentage, means, and standard deviation to describe the


                       demographic  profile,  online  shopping  personality  types,  and  consumers'  buying

                       behavior.

                              F-statistics or F-value was used in presenting the test of the difference between

                              P-value was also used to determine whether there was a significant difference

                       or no significant difference. If  it is less than or equal to 0.05, there is a significant

                       difference, but there is no significant difference if it is greater than 0.05.

                                                 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION




                              This  chapter  presents  the  findings  of  the  data  as  a  result  of  the  survey


                       conducted. It also presents pertinent information regarding the problem under study.

                       Reliability Analysis

                              The developed questionnaire was administered to 50 participants, who were

                       not  included  in  the  study,  to  determine  its  internal  consistency  before  it  was

                       administered to the actual participants. Chronbach’s analysis was used to assess the

                       constructs reliability.

                              Table  2  presents  the  Cronbachʼs  alpha  reliability  coefficients  of  the  scales


                       under study after accounting for the reversely-worked items. Generally, the minimum

                       acceptable requirements of Cronbachʼs alpha coefficient should be greater than 0.70

                       (Hair 1998; George & Mallery, 2003) to achieve internal consistency among the test

                       items

                              The Cronbachʼs alpha reliability coefficients of each scales was greater than


                       0.70. Therefore, the Cronbach’s alpha reliability coefficients for the online shopping

                       personality  types  and  types  of  buying  behavior  reveal  good  to  high  internal

                       consistency.]]></page><page Index="54"><![CDATA[32

                       Demographic Profile


                              The demographic profiles of the participants were collected through the survey

                       questionnaires that were distributed to them. The data included age, sex, civil status,

                       and monthly income.

                              Table 4 shows that most of the participants (50%) belonged to the age bracket

                       of 25-40 years old and were female (68.50%). Mostly, (89.50%) of the participants are

                       employed (47.50%) and have monthly income ranging from Php 10,000 and below.

                         Millennials prefer online shopping because it is more convenient in shipping, delivery,


                       and price comparison. It allows them to shop from the comfort of their own home or

                       office. Women are more enthusiastic about e-commerce and online shopping than

                       men,  who  prefer  to  shop  in  physical  stores  (Columbus,  2020).  The majority  of  the

                       participants have a job and a steady income that makes it possible to purchase a

                       product through online shopping.]]></page><page Index="55"><![CDATA[33


                              According to the study of Horrigan (2018), he stated that low-income people

                       might be expected to benefit most from finding bargains online – something half the

                       online population sees as a benefit of using the internet to shop. Certain features of

                       online shopping might make using the internet for shopping attractive to low income

                              Table 4 shows the online shopping personality of consumers as adventurous

                       explorers. The highest weighted mean of 4.16, which was interpreted as agree, is they

                       always  check  the  online  shops  to  know  about  the  latest  product,  and  the  lowest

                       weighted mean of 2.84, which was interpreted as slightly agree is they create pages


                       on social media to share about the latest products and promotions of online shops. As

                       a result, the study revealed that the consumer agreed that they considered themselves

                       Buying Behavior of Online Shoppers

                              Table 11 shows the complex buying behavior of online shoppers in Cavite. The

                       highest weighted mean of 4.51 was interpreted as strongly agree, which stated that

                       they prefer to read reviews before purchasing a product. The lowest weighted mean of

                       family before deciding to buy. The overall result of complex buying behavior weighted

                       mean of 4.74 was interpreted as strongly agree, which means that the consumer is

                       highly involved in the purchase decision. The consumer will research thoroughly before

                       buying products. This implies that online reviews give power to the customers to tell


                       their side of the buying story. This provides social proof to other potential customers.

                       Reading reviews or suggestions before purchasing a product will help customers to

                       get a good quality product to be satisfied with what they buy (Kaeming, 2020).

                       age. It can be said that a business user's personality type has a significant difference

                       in  terms  of  age.  This  means  that  the  business  user's  personality  type  may  differ

                       age. This means that the personality of a business user varies with age because being

                       an entrepreneur is dependent on the person who holds it. Anyone can enter this field,

                              Table 17 shows the difference in buying behavior when grouped according to

                       age. It can be shown that there is a highly significant difference between complex

                       buying behavior and a significant difference in variety-seeking buying behavior. Others

                       such  as  dissonance-reducing  and  habitual  have  no  significant  difference  when


                       grouped according to age.

                              This implies that complex buying behavior and variety-seeking behavior have

                       a  significant  age  difference.  According  to  Clootrack  (2021),  age  is  a  major  factor

                       influencing buying behavior. The buying choices of youth differ from that of middle-

                       aged people. Elderly people have different buying behavior. Teenagers will be more


                       interested in buying colorful clothes and beauty products. Middle-aged is focused on

                       house, property, and vehicle for the family.

                       browsers according to sex.

                              This means that the study discovered a significant difference between business


                       users. Ward (2019) found that society's positive perception of entrepreneurship has a

                       stronger effect on females than males pursuing entrepreneurial activities. Women are

                       generally more concerned about their privacy on the web than men. The main concern]]></page><page Index="68"><![CDATA[46


                       that  discourages  women  from  engaging  in  electronic  commerce  is  the  possible

                       disclosure of personal information; however, men are willing to accept that risk for the

                       earned profit (Bouhnik, 2018). In addition, fearful browsers based on sex have different

                       perspectives on online buying. For example, women prefer to buy what they will use


                       online, whereas men prefer to see the product before purchasing.

                                    SUMMARY, CONCLUSION, AND RECOMMENDATION



                              This chapter presents the summary of the study, the conclusion drawn and the

                       recommendations made regarding to the online shopping personality types and type


                       of buying behavior of consumers in Cavite.

                       Summary

                              This study was conducted to determine the online shopping personality types

                       and consumers' buying behavior in Cavite. Specifically, the study aimed to determine

                       the demographic profiles of the participants; describe the online shopping personality


                       type of consumers; identify the type of buying behavior of online shoppers; determine

                       if there is a significant difference between their personality type and buying behavior

                       when grouped according to their demographic characteristics.

                              The study followed a descriptive design. It was used to describe the online

                       shopping personality types of consumers. It was also used to identify online shoppers'

                       buying  behavior  and  determine  if  there  is  a  significant  difference  between  their

                       personality type and buying behavior when grouped according to their demographic


                       characteristics. Furthermore, the researchers used quota sampling to determine the

                       number of participants.

                                  The  data  were  gathered  using  self-administered  survey  questionnaires  that

                       were distributed to 200 participants' online shoppers in Cavite.

                                  The researcher gathered data from September to December 2021. As a result,


                       most  of  the  participants  belonged  to the  age  bracket  of  25-40  years  old  and  were

                       female. Also, most of them were employed and had a monthly income ranging from

                       10,000 and below.

                              Furthermore, researchers gathered data that online shopping personality types

                       are  shopping  lovers  and  fun-seekers,  and  consumers'  buying  behavior  is  complex

                       buying behavior, dissonance-reducing behavior, and habitual buying behavior. Based

                       on the result, there is a significant difference between online shopping personality type,]]></page><page Index="74"><![CDATA[52


                       which is business users, in terms of age, sex, and monthly income. Meanwhile, there

                       is a significant difference between buying behavior in age and employment status.

                       Conclusion

                              After the analysis of the results, the following conclusion were drawn:


                              1.  Most of the participants belonged to the age bracket of 25-40 years old and

                                 were female. Also, most of them were employed and had monthly incomes

                                 ranging from 10,000 and below.

                              2.  It is shown in the results that online shoppers are fun-seekers and shopping

                                 lovers. Most of the participants strongly agree that they are fun-seekers


                                 because they see the entertainment value in the online shop but are careful

                                 when buying the product and shopping lovers result as they enjoy shopping

                                 online with no regrets.

                              3.  The type of buying behavior of online shoppers is complex buying behavior.

                                 This means that the consumer is highly involved in the purchase decision,

                                 and the consumer will research thoroughly before buying products. They

                                 also strongly agree that dissonance-reducing buying behavior means that


                                 consumers buy a readily available product and will be forced to buy goods

                                 that  do  not  have  many  choices.  Therefore,  consumers  will  be  left  with

                                 limited decision-making. Lastly, they strongly agree that they have habitual

                                 buying behavior, which means that the consumer is buying products that

                                 they use for their daily routine, and they do not put a lot of thought into the


                                 product. They tend to buy products that are familiar to them.

                              4.  There is a significant difference between business user personality types in

                                 terms of age, sex, and monthly income, while fearful browsers' personality

                                 types have significant differences according to sex. There is a significant

                                 difference  between  the  participants  in  variety-seeking  behavior  when

                                 grouped  according  to  age  and  employment  status  in  terms  of  buying]]></page><page Index="75"><![CDATA[53


                                 behavior.  Meanwhile,  there  is  a  highly  significant  difference  in  complex

                                 buying behavior according to age.

                       Recommendations

                              The researcher further recommends the following:


                              1.  Online retailers should ensure that their online shopping process through

                                 their website is easy, simple, convenient, and secure for consumers. They

                                 should also build a secure platform to prevent cyber hacking, especially for

                                 customers who are hesitant to buy online because of security issues.

                              2.  This  study  provides  a  foundation  for  future  researchers  in  studying


                                 consumer behavior and types of online shoppers. Further research can be

                                 possible by increasing the sample size, including a rural population that

                                 may reflect the entire scenario of consumer behavior of online shopping in

                                 Cavite.  Furthermore,  the  variables  identified  in  this  study  may  not  be

                                 sufficient,  and  more  variables  are  to  be  considered  in  future  research.

                                 Researchers may also look for factors that influence the online shopping

                                 personality types and types of buying behavior.


                              3.  These findings may provide online business entrepreneurs with pertinent

                                 information to create and plan marketing strategies that are in line with the

                                 online shopping behavior of the consumer considering online shopping is

                                 the most popular online activity. To build consumer trust or loyalty, online

                                 store sites are advised to make useful features such as price comparison


                                 features,  make  online  shop  sites  user-friendly  and  provide  the  latest

                                 information, because the utility of online shop sites will foster trust in the

                                 minds of consumers.

                              4.  The online business should drive clients to pay more attention to product or

                                 service  information  research,  promote  the  products  for  customer

                                 awareness, and then increase the online shopping experience to boost the

                                 online shopper’s acceptance, trust, and loyalty.]]></page><page Index="76"><![CDATA[54

                                   This  study  was  conducted  to  determine  the  online  and  offline  shopping

                       experience  and  preference  of  selected    working-class      millennials  in  Cavite.

                       Specifically, the study aimed to determine the demographic profiles of the participants;


                       describe  the  shopping  experience of selected  working-class  millennials in terms of:

                       positive emotional; sensory; intellectual; social;  and pragmatic experience; determine

                       convenience; variety; discounts; availability of unique products;  and return of products;

                       determine if there is a significant effect of online and offline shopping  experience  to


                       shopping  preference  of  selected  working-class  millennials; and identify if there is a

                       significant difference in online and offline shopping experiences and preferences when

                       grouped according to their demographic profile.

                       class millennials. Furthermore, the researchers used the snowball  sampling technique

                       in this study. The data were gathered using self-administered survey questionnaires


                       that  were  distributed  to  200  selected  working  class-millennials  in  Cavite,  from

                       November 2021 to December 2022. As a result, majority of the participants belonged

                       to the age bracket of 26-29 years old and are female. Majority of them are single and

                       have monthly income ranging from Php7,000 below. The working-class millennials are

                       buying online once and/or twice a week  during pandemic and they usually buy clothes.


                       While they buy offline at least twice a week during pandemic and buy groceries. It was

                                                        INTRODUCTION



                              Many customers prefer to buy offline because it enables them to inspect the

                       products  and  take  goods  of  them  immediately  after  paying.  Due  to  the  extreme

                       widespread use of computers, the internet has opened up a larger and more appealing

                       market to current consumers. To purchase products from the internet, customers must

                       have access to the internet and a legitimate method of payment. The major difference


                       between traditional and online selling is the extent of interaction between the consumer

                       and the seller (Shanthi & Kannaiah, 2016).

                              Many studies have focused on the view that offline shopping is the best when

                       the consumer feels that they need to touch, smell, or try the product. On the other

                       hand, the kind of business online retailers are doing is proof enough that they are

                       providing some benefits to the customers, which offline shopping does not give to the

                       customer (Kaur & Kaur, 2018). The internet is redefining the way people shop for and


                       purchase goods and services, and it has quickly become a global phenomenon. Many

                       businesses have begun to use the Internet to decrease marketing costs and,]]></page><page Index="128"><![CDATA[2


                       as a result, lower the price of their products and services to remain competitive in highly

                       competitive marketplaces (Muntaqheem & Raiker, 2019).

                              There is an emerging growth of shopping online especially when the pandemic

                       came in 2020. In other countries, it has been observed that lockdowns are increasing,


                       non-essential companies are closing, and consumers are generally avoiding public

                       settings while shopping but for critical things. Because of the closing of brick-and-

                       mortar establishments, people have turned to internet shopping to suit their demands.

                       Hence this study was undertaken to study consumer preference during the COVID19

                       epidemic, both online and offline. Also, it analyzes the  significant differences between


                       the  online  and  offline  consumer  groups  in  terms  of  demographic,  technology  use,

                       availability,  and  consumer  experience  while  examining  the  factors  influencing

                       consumer  preference  between  offline  shopping  and  online  shopping  during  the

                       pandemic situation (Sinha et al., 2021).

                              During this period, offline brick-and-mortar stores gradually go down, and some

                       merchants  face  bankruptcy.  Therefore,  consumers'  experience  and  preference

                       towards online and offline shopping are worth researching, so as to help online and


                       offline  merchants  better  improve  their  services  to  attract  more  people,  so  as  to

                       maximize their own interests and value.

                              In the research it is mentioned that consumers' online and offline shopping

                       preferences  vary  with  different  products,  consumers,  and  stages  of  shopping

                       experience. Thus, the researchers wanted to determine the preferences of working-

                       class millennials. (Levin, Levin, and Weller, 2020).


                              According to Costin (2019), when shopping, millennials focus on discounts.

                       They value price over recommendations, the brand’s reputation, and even product

                       quality. They follow brands online just for discount opportunities. Sixty-six percent of

                       millennials would switch brands if offered at least a 30 percent discount, and only a

                       third see a brand to consider trends or product updates (Costin, 2019).]]></page><page Index="129"><![CDATA[3


                              Consequently, the purpose of this research study is to determine the online

                       and offline shopping experience and preferences of selected working-class

                       millennials in Cavite. In this study, various factors affecting the selection of online

                       and offline shopping experience and preference will be compared and analyzed. The


                       study is expected to provide meaningful data. Furthermore, this study can also

                       contribute to providing a deeper understanding of the experience and preferences of

                       working-class millennials during times of deep external impact, such as a pandemic.

                       Statement of the Problem

                              This study was conducted to determine online and offline shopping experience


                       and preference during pandemic of selected working-class millennials in Cavite.

                              Specifically, the study aimed to answer the following questions:

                                     1.  What is the socio demographic profile of the participants in terms

                                         millennials in terms of:

                                          a. convenience;

                                          b. variety;

                                           c. discounts;

                                           d. availability of unique products; and

                                           e. return of products.

                                     4.  determine if there is a significant effect of online and offline shopping

                          experience to shopping preference of selected working-class millennials; and

                                     5.  Identify  if  there  is  a  significant  difference  in  online  and  offline

                          shopping  experiences  and  preferences  when  grouped  according  to  their

                          demographic profile.


                       Hypothesis

                              The researchers hypothesize the following:

                              H1: There is no significant effect of online and offline shopping experience to

                       shopping preference. It shows in the study that there are certain factors that has an

                       effect on online and offline shopping experience. Thus, the null hypothesis is rejected.

                              H2: There is no significant difference in online and offline shopping experience


                       and preference. As a result, there are significant differences shown in terms of age,

                       civil status, monthly income and significantly on frequency of buying online. Hence, the

                       null hypothesis is rejected.]]></page><page Index="132"><![CDATA[6


                       Conceptual Framework of the Study

                              This section indicates the conceptual framework used by the researchers in

                       conducting this study. It describes how the concepts were related to each other and

                       shows the steps to achieve the objective of the study.


                              As shown in the Figure 1 below the independent variable in this study is the

                       demographic profile and online and offline shopping of working-class millennials in

                       Cavite while the dependent variables are online and offline shopping experience and

                       preference. The working class includes both  white and blue-collar workers, manual

                       and menial workers of all types, excluding only individuals who derive their income


                       from business ownership and the labor of others (Kenton W., reviewed by James M.

                       2021) . The factors that used by the researchers in measuring the online and offline

                       preference of the participants are adapted on a previous study of Sarkar and Das

                       (2017). On the other hand, each factor of shopping experience in this study is based

                       on the study of Martinez and Casielles (2018).

                       researchers that will be having the same topic in their study.

                       Time and Place of the Study

                              The study was conducted from September 2021 to December 2021. The data

                       were gathered from selected working-class millennials in Cavite.

                       Scope and Limitations of the Study

                              The study focused on the preference and experience towards online and offline

                       shopping of the working-class millennials in Cavite. This also determined the socio


                       demographic  profile  of  the  participants  in  terms  of  age,  sex,  civil  status,    monthly

                       income, frequency of buying online and offline, and products bought online and offline.

                       In measuring the online and offline shopping preference of the participants it is only

                       limited to the adapted and modified factors based on the study of Sarkar and Das

                       (2017)  that is convenience, variety, discounts, availability of]]></page><page Index="134"><![CDATA[8

                       experience of the participants were measured by the factors given based on the study

                       of  Martinez  and  Casielles  (2018).  Other  than  that,  further  factors  which  are  not

                       discussed will not be the scope in this research. The data to be gathered will be solely


                       based on the response of the participants.

                       Definition of Terms

                              This section indicates the definition of different terms that the researchers used

                       in the study. The following terms are relevant to this research:

                                             REVIEW OF RELATED LITERATURE



                              This  chapter  contains  different  articles  that  were  used  to  support  the

                       conceptualization  of  the  study.  It  also  includes  relevant  studies  that  support  and

                       contribute to the development of the concepts of the study.

                       Working Millennials Spending Habits and Why they Buy

                              They are poised to be the nation’s biggest spenders, as they move into their

                       prime  earning  and  spending  years,  so  millennials  dominate  conversations  around

                       product strategy, marketing, and the economy at large. This generation is different,

                       and so brands must see and interact with them as a unique consumer in order to draw

                       their attention and business (Costin, 2019).


                              The majority  of  these  young  people  have  less  than  $1,000  in  their  savings

                       accounts, and a significant number have no savings at all. They have less credit card

                       debt and car purchases than previous generations, most likely because lenders have

                       tightened  the  requirements  for  granting  credit  and  loans.  More  than  65  percent  of

                       millennials do not have a credit card at all.

                              Millennials consider social responsibility and environmental friendliness when

                       considering  their  purchases,  so  brands  face  millennials’  significant  expectations  in


                       terms of shopping and investment dollars. They typically choose to either follow their

                       own instincts or go along with their peers but have become rather wary of financial

                       advice  given  by  parents  and  professionals  in  the  field.  They  also  prefer  personal

                       connections with those who manage their money, who reflect their highly held values

                       of trust, authenticity, and choice.


                              According to Costin (2019), when shopping, millennials focus on discounts.

                       They value price over recommendations, the brand’s reputation, and even product

                       quality.  They  follow  brands  online  just  for  discount  opportunities.  66  percent  of

                       millennials would switch brands if offered at least a 30 percent discount, and only a

                       third see a brand to consider trends or product updates.]]></page><page Index="137"><![CDATA[11


                              Ironically,  60  percent  of  millennials  state  loyalty  to  brands  they  currently

                       purchase  from  if  treated  well  through  customer-centric  experience.  To  ensure

                       allegiance,  companies  include  loyalty  programs  with  custom  discounts  as  well  as

                       active courtship.


                              Other values that brands should center upon are authenticity, local sourcing,

                       ethical production, a great shopping experience, and giving back to society. Seventy

                       five percent of millennials consider it fairly or very important that brands give back to

                       society instead of just making a profit.

                              Filipino youth as millennials, they typically refer to a very specific segment of

                       our population. Millennials are characterized as young people who are educated, tech-

                       savvy, well-travelled, and cosmopolitan with their choices in life (Cornelio, 2016).


                              Market researchers and advertisers are naturally interested in them as a target

                       demographic. But they too reinforce the stereotype that they are highly mobile and

                       readily willing to transfer from one job to another. These are, of course, young people

                       who come from affluent backgrounds with a lifestyle that affords them to experience

                       the best the world has to offer.


                              Cornelio (2016) said these millennials can choose to eat, pray, and love. Theirs

                       is  a  disposition  that  is  not  only  consumerist  but  also  willing  to  encounter  new

                       discoveries. After all, the affluence of the Philippine economy  – thanks to booming

                       industries and OFW remittances – has given birth to a segment of young people who

                       can  afford  an  experimental  lifestyle.  Although  their  disposition  is  thoroughly

                       individualistic, they are not necessarily egocentric. Older people might find them selfish

                       because millennials "want it all" and they "want it now." This explains their insatiable


                       drive for new gadgets, clubbing, travel, rewarding jobs. But they are not self-seeking.

                       They want occupations that give them meaning. Passion is a tangible virtue for them.

                       And in many cases, their passion is about making a positive difference in the world

                       (Cornelio, 2016).]]></page><page Index="138"><![CDATA[12


                       Consumers that are Most Likely to Purchase Online shopping

                              In sampling a nationwide panel of consumers who had online capabilities at

                       home, Chu (2019) compared those who did and did not make purchases online during

                       the  preceding  holiday  shopping  season.  They  found  that  online  shoppers  were


                       younger, wealthier, better educated, more computer literate and more likely to spend

                       time on the computer, more likely to find online shopping to be easy and entertaining,

                       and less fearful about financial loss resulting from online transactions. Chu, (2019) also

                       found Internet shoppers to be younger, more educated, and wealthier and to have a

                       more “wired lifestyle,” but also to be more time constrained than non-Internet shoppers.


                       He  found  perceived  substitutability  of  perception  of  the  electronic  environment  for

                       personally  experiencing  products  to  be  an  important  predictor  of  online  shopping

                       attitudes.

                       Physical Store and Online Store

                              Indeed, Editorial Team (2021), defined physical store, often referred to as a

                       brick-and-mortar store, as a retail environment that requires physical space to display

                       and sell products. Physical stores can be free-standing structures, tenants in a mall or


                       shopping  center  or  linked  to  venues  such  as  museums,  public  attractions,  or

                       residences.  It  employs  retail  employees  who  educate  and  assist  shoppers  while

                       maintaining the store's appearance and inventory. Some stores rely more on window-

                       shopping when people pass by and become interested enough to browse products.

                       Others serve clients with specialized needs and remain relatively unknown to the rest

                       of the public. For instance, a candle store in a mall attracts shoppers with its displays


                       and fragrances. A swimming pool supply store may not be in a visible location, but its

                       customers reliably return for its niche products (IBT, 2021).

                              Physical stores could be independent businesses or franchises. Independent

                       businesses  target  local  customers,  while  franchises  can  rely  on  widespread  brand

                       recognition to drive business (IBT, 2021). Its marketing approaches largely depend on

                       whether it is independent businesses or franchises. Independent businesses often]]></page><page Index="139"><![CDATA[13


                       develop  local  advertising  strategies,  relying  on  local  publications,  radio  stations,

                       signage,  and  word-of-mouth.  It  also  might  use  loyalty  rewards programs  to  gain  a

                       competitive edge after making an initial sale to a customer. Franchises, however, often

                       have regional or national recognition that makes them the default choice for a certain


                       product.

                              Physical stores typically have set hours of operation and might close during

                       holidays or on certain days of the week. This limits when sales can occur and require

                       communication between the store and the public. Customers can access and purchase

                       from online stores at any time, enabling more sales and greater convenience. Offline


                       stores attempt to provide an enjoyable customer experience by educating sales staff,

                       creating  engaging  displays  and  encouraging  customer  interaction  with  products

                       through sampling or demonstrations. Talented sales associates help drive business by

                       establishing  strong  customer  bonds  that  lead  to  repeat  business.  It  might  spend

                       considerable  money  on  seasonal  or  promotional  decorations  that  attract  window

                       shoppers or on designs that make a store seem sleek and attractive (IBT, 2021).

                              Typically, physical store owners must commit to a space and make regular


                       sales or face closure. Moving locations to cut costs can be a major challenge, as it

                       risks losing business gained from a convenient or appealing location. Physical stores

                       must compete both with similar stores in their geographic area and, in many cases,

                       with online retailers. Business models that rely on physical stores must consider if their

                       product sells better in person than online to ensure demand is sustainable.

                              On the other hand, online stores typically rely on a mix of social media, online


                       publicity, and paid advertisements to market to customers (IBT, 2021). Targeted ads

                       allow online stores to advertise to their ideal demographic, making marketing easier. If

                       an online store can gain recognition through a creative social media presence, it may

                       spend substantially less on paid advertisements. Online publications that write product

                       recommendations also seek unique online retailers to share with readers.]]></page><page Index="140"><![CDATA[14


                              According to IBT (2021), the online stores create a customer experience with

                       creative content posted on social media and uniquely designed web pages. Online

                       stores must have an intuitive layout so visitors can find what they're looking for and

                       clearly view the products they're considering. Online stores also must plan for how to


                       handle returns or customer questions. They usually offer customer service via email or

                       phone.

                              Online stores can adapt much more easily. Online businesses usually avoid

                       interrupting their operations, but if a site owner wants to change domains or take time

                       to redesign their website, the financial consequences are less severe. Online stores


                       have to compete with the major online marketplaces that can usually offer low prices

                       and faster shipping. The online stores that can offer unique products sold nowhere else

                       are therefore better suited to succeed.

                       Customer Experience (CX)

                              Customer  experience  (CX)  has  become  a  hot  topic  of  discussion  in  the

                       corporate boardroom today. Since the mid-2000s, the topic has been appearing with

                       increasing  frequency  in  a  variety  of  corporate  discussions  on  business  strategy,


                       marketing  strategy,  customer  service,  and  general  business  management  (Batra,

                       2016).  As  customers’  expectations  from  interactions  with  businesses  have  been

                       evolving at a rapid pace in today’s dynamic era of consumer empowerment and digital

                       disruption, a variety of modern CX programs have been created, and more programs

                       are  in  the  making.  The  blending  of  new  strategic  thoughts  with  digital  technology

                       advancements provides a tremendous opportunity for practitioners to capitalize on this


                       emerging frontier of customer service excellence. Customer centricity in organizations

                       is not new. It has been an organizational focus for the last sixty years with periodic

                       primary  emphasis  on  its  sub-dimensions,  such  as  customer  satisfaction,  service

                       quality, relationship marketing, customer lifetime value, customer delight etc. However,

                       the current emerging dimension of CX is much broader in scope,  which has  resulted

                       from the recent advancements in digital technology and]]></page><page Index="141"><![CDATA[15


                       the resulting consumer empowerment. The technological advancements in the form of

                       digital disruption have led to the creation of numerous innovative CX-related digital

                       products  (such as  software-based  customer  journey  map,  text  analytics,  predictive

                       analytics, prescriptive analytics, descriptive analytics, big data analytics, self-learning


                       video  analytics,  true  driver analysis,  and  consumer  data  mining)  that  are available

                       through some popular digital vendors, such as Maritz-CX, Forrester, and CX Network.

                       Further, the omni-presence of social media and mobile platforms along with their easy

                       and  free-of-charge  (or  low-priced) accessibility  to  consumers  have  empowered  the

                       consumers,  thereby  raising  their  expectations  from  the  corporations.  The  rising


                       expectations  of  the  empowered  consumers  place  pressures  on  organizations  to

                       continually evolve from the mere CX-tactical organizations to CX- focus organizations

                       to CX-adaptive organizations. Accordingly, the evolving organizations need to consider

                       holistic CX programs for better CX-related performance in terms of customer attraction,

                       customer  acquisition,  customer  retention  and  customer  loyalty,  increased  share  of

                       customer wallet, increased revenue, profitability, and business growth.

                       Shopping Experience

                              When  a  consumer  decides  to  buy  online,  several  features  will  determine

                       whether the customer is willing to continue using the e-retail system or not. However,

                       novelties  which  are  a  form  of  innovative  graphics  done  on  the  site  proves  to  be

                       irreplaceable when it comes to referring and encouraging customers to visit online

                       stores, browse the internet and consumption of various products and services on the

                       online platform. According to Ward (2016), consumers are conscious of time pressed


                       and are more convenient – an oriented, value-added service that brings and saves

                       their time. Online stores have been seen to have a ubiquitous nature, as they are

                       available 24 hours a day for the purpose of customers’ convenience. Therefore, online

                       shopping saves time for both the seller and the buyer, as it can discard long trips to

                       the store, long queues, and delay when at the store. Online customers prefer]]></page><page Index="142"><![CDATA[16


                       using online shopping for faster and efficient shopping experience from the comfort of

                       their homes. Additionally, it is evident that most online retailers are providing better

                       channel variations that bring them into direct contact with the consumer without setting

                       an eye on the customer in the physical store. Thus, online shopping services could


                       fulfil the goals of both the customers and the online firms. The importance of web

                       design has been stressed as salient factors towards online shoppers’ perception in

                       several studies. Ranganathan and Ganapathy (2017) stated that security and privacy

                       are essential and are used as the dimensions of online shopping experience.

                              The experiences formed during shopping play a fundamental role (Homburg et


                       al. 2017). Understanding how consumers experience emotions caused by marketing

                       stimuli raises various implications in the design of the retailer’s offer. Retailers need to

                       develop action procedures that allow them to manage what they can offer in marketing

                       experiences  (Alfaro,  2012)  as  reviewed  by  Martinez  and  Casielles,(2018).  The

                       following dimension of experience will help the study to be more structured.

                              Positive  emotional  experience.  This  dimension  focused  on  how  positive

                       emotions  can  affect  customers'  experience.  When  customers  visit  and  shop  in  a


                       retailer, they may want different experiences that surprise them. Therefore, retailers

                       should control key determinants of customer experience dimensions for successful

                       management of their store. Customer’s surprise, resulting from the experiences in  the

                       store,  can  cause  different  emotions  (e.g.,  happy,  hopeful,  entertaining,  animated

                       and/or enthusiastic). These positive emotions affect shopping time, willingness to pay

                       more for the same product and loyalty to the retailer. Also, positive emotions converge


                       on memorability, and the perceptions of a company’s image are enhanced, stimulating

                       purchases and generating close and lasting relationships with the brand (Martinez &

                       Casielles, 2018).

                              In addition, Martinez and Casielles (2018) said emotions may be classified as

                       positive or negative. This distinction refers to whether a stimulus can promote or]]></page><page Index="143"><![CDATA[17


                       obstruct  a  certain  objective.  The  company  should  create  positive  emotional

                       experiences  because  the  consumer  tends  to  seek  positive  emotions  and  avoid

                       negative ones. If the consumer gets excited about a store, he will try to relive the same

                       experience to maintain or increase the resulting positive emotional state.


                              According to the findings of the  Advertising Research Foundation (2021), a

                       measure referred to as “likeability” determines whether an ad will increase a brand’s

                       sales. It shows a consumer’s emotional response to an ad has a greater influence on

                       decisions  than  the  ad’s  content.  And  reveal  that  positive  emotions  have  a  greater

                       impact on customer loyalty than other customer satisfaction metrics. Consumers have


                       the power to learn almost anything they want about a company, brand, product, or

                       service. Social media enables customers to be a part of public discourse on a myriad

                       of topics, ranging from lifestyle to politics. So, when it comes to their digital and physical

                       interactions with brands, modern consumers expect special treatment (Ciric, 2021)

                       Therefore, brands need to listen attentively to the consumers and engage with them

                       appropriately. Some consumers think their relationship with brands implies providing

                       feedback. And they expect brands to be extremely responsive to that feedback, others


                       feel they have a special relationship with a company. Consumers are aware brands

                       are listening to their feedback. But two out of three consumers expect brands to adapt

                       communications and offerings based on that feedback (Ciric, 2021).

                              As technology progresses, they see an increase in the number of touchpoints

                       a brand has with its customers. This increase led to more immediate communication

                       with consumers. They can let people know how they feel about a certain product or


                       service  more  effectively  than  ever  before.  Therefore,  brands  should  focus  on

                       understanding the role of emotional customer experience and find ways to humanize

                       their  interactions  at  every  customer  touchpoint  (Ciric,  2021)  Having  established  a

                       personality, brands need to be consistent in delivering the brand promise. Consumers

                       form their relationships with brands based on trust, just like friends  do.]]></page><page Index="144"><![CDATA[18


                       Prove  to  the  customers  they  can  trust  the  brand.  If  the  company  is  consistent  in

                       interactions, it can earn loyal customers that keep bringing value to the company (Ciric,

                       2021).

                              Sensory experience. This dimension focused on how the senses of a person


                       affect his/her experience as a customer. Sensory marketing is defined as “marketing

                       that  engages  the consumer’s senses  and  affects  their  perceptions,  judgments  and

                       behaviors”  (Martinez  &  Casielles,  2021).  Shop  atmosphere  literature  has  identified

                       experiences  that  customers  perceive  by  the  senses  of  somatosensorial,  olfaction,

                       hearing, sight, and taste. These sensory experiences are caused in environments by


                       a variety of stimuli. It affects different environmental factors that it modifies based on

                       the sensory experience that it wants to offer. Thus, the lighting varies, the layout of the

                       product,  the  design,  the  smells,  the  color,  the  music.  Sensory-based  stores  have

                       experienced  great  developments  in  sales.  The  shops  where  the  brand  is  played,

                       smelled, and heard gain more sales than others. The following are related studies

                       related to sensory experience.

                              Visual. This type of experience focuses on colors, shapes, distance, article


                       size, lighting, or digital merchandising. It is the most direct way to provide information

                       to consumers, either offline, online, or through advertising exhibitions, attracting them

                       to the shop and trying to get the consumer to remember and “record” in their mind.

                       Designing a good visual experience is decisive for a retailer, given that 90 percent of

                       the information received by the brain is visual. The most studied factor is the impact of

                       color as a trigger in the decision to shop and choose a brand (Tantanatewin & inkarojrit,


                       2016).

                              Scent. This type of experience focuses on stimulation of smell is a marketing

                       tool of great potential, since it allows the retailer to generate affective states, promote

                       a product, positioning a brand, or to assign “exclusive aromas”' ' to a retailer and to

                       differentiate it from the competition. In addition, it is also used to stimulate impulse-

                       buying at stores. For the scent experience to produce greater positive effects, there]]></page><page Index="145"><![CDATA[19


                       needs to be congruence between the smell, the desired environment for a retailer, the

                       product offered, and/or the profile of the target buyer (Spence et al. 2014; Krishna,

                       2013 reviewed by Martinez & Casielles, 2018).

                              Auditory. This type of experience focuses on sense of hearing. It is constantly


                       active, making it an interesting point of attention for retailers who wish to apply sensory

                       marketing to their store. It is not just about experiencing the sound, but trying to create,

                       through music and the voice, a link with the consumer, facilitating the representation

                       of the brand in the consumers’ minds, and creating associations that activate emotions

                       and experiences. The review of the literature places special emphasis on the use of


                       music as a tool to create the store image in the consumer’s mind, as well as the identity

                       of the brand. In addition, it can help to change the mood and to create sensations that

                       help customers to extend their shopping time (Zaltman & Puccinelli, 2000; Wiener &

                       Chartrand, 2014 reviewed by Martinez & Casielles, 2018).

                              Taste. This type of experience focuses on sense of taste. The sense of taste

                       has been studied in the field of food and beverage products. The responses to different

                       flavors are programmed genetically, instead of being learned or linked to experience,


                       but they are highly influenced by the rest of the senses, so that taste can be considered

                       as  a  mix  of  the  rest  of  the  senses,  since  these  can  affect  the  perception  of  the

                       consumer’s taste. This raises many possibilities of action of the shop that offer food

                       and drink products, since they can link their products with certain scents to modify the

                       behavior of consumers (Lawton, 2016).


                              Tactile. This type of experience focuses on sense of touch. Touching a product

                       is fundamental when generating consumer information, given that the integration of

                       these tactile perceptions in their behavior facilitates the purchase decision. Being able

                       to touch the products and to experiment with them, intentionally or not, makes the

                       customer–product relationship much closer, thus favoring the possibility of purchase.

                       marketing research has focused on the hands as a primary source of the perceptual

                       system: they are the “outer brain” of a person (George, 2015; Gallace & Spence, 2014

                       reviewed by Martinez & Casielles, 2018).

                              Intellectual experience. This dimension focused on how thinking, imagination,


                       and curiosity influence customer experience. Intellectual experiences are experiences

                       associated with thinking and conscious mental processes to get consumers to use their

                       imagination  or  problem  solving  so  that  they  review  suppositions  about  a  product.

                       According to Martinez and Casielles (2018), this type of experience occurs when a

                       strategy  (intellectual  experience  through  design)  and/or  communication  with


                       employees (intellectual experience with employees) help to inspire customer curiosity

                       and  invite  them  to  think  and  to  imagine.  Curiosity  is  the  motivating  state  among

                       consumers when a marketer evokes mystery. Researchers supporting that curiosity

                       causes positive results for sellers (Hill, 2016). For example, the Apple Store shows its

                       products and allows consumers to interact with them. An interesting tool for retailers is

                       augmented  reality,  which  will  have  an  important  development  in  the  near  future

                       (Javornik, 2016). It’s the practice of augmenting a real-time direct or indirect view of


                       the  real  physical  world  with  virtual  information.  For  example,  IKEA  could  help

                       consumers visualize how a new closet might look next to their existing furniture. When

                       intellectual experiences happen, they result in different types of creative thinking such

                       as  convergent  and  divergent  thinking.  Convergent  thinking  entails  using  heuristics

                       (rules of thumb) to decide and induce the consumer's thinking to move along a planned

                       sequence. Divergent thinking involves educating and teaching consumers to develop


                       some  originality  in  different  and  creative  ways.  Divergent  thinking  is  an  activity

                       contained  in  another  function  of  the  mind  called  the  imagination.  By  imagining,

                       consumers create something new, something they had never seen in the same terms,

                       reviewing their idea about a product or service and  the mental assumptions commonly

                       accepted with it. Therefore, the offer of original]]></page><page Index="147"><![CDATA[21


                       and  creative  activities  involves  a  greater  diversity  of  experience  and  satisfaction

                       (Martinez & Casielles, 2018).

                              Social experience. This dimension focused on how shopping is considered as

                       a social experience. According to Ferguson (2010) reviewed by Martinez & Casielles


                       (2018), this type of experience refers to the consumer himself and his social context,

                       his relationships with other consumers, and with the employees. From the research of

                       Tauber (1972), the literature suggests that shopping is a social experience, so that

                       relationships  with  the  group  are  determinants  of  many  of  their  behaviors.  Social

                       experience  implicates  the  consumer  and  his/her  social  environment,  his/her


                       relationship with other consumers and also with his/her ideal self. A seller can develop

                       this dimension of experience with different strategies that allow consumers to enjoy

                       themselves during their shopping time. For example, a) go shopping with family/friends

                       and get information about new products or trends that reflect attitudes and lifestyles;

                       b) opportunity to interact with other customers who share interests; c) go shopping to

                       belong to a social identity, inducing a sense of belonging or the distinction from a social

                       group.  Sales  staffs  are  fundamental  in  providing  positive  customer  experiences


                       (Martinez & Casielles, 2018).

                              Pragmatic experience. This dimension implies that the consumer is motivated

                       by the utility, value, functionality, efficiency, convenience, and usability of things, and

                       not by their appearance, aesthetics, or social context (Martinez & Casielles, 2018). It

                       refers to heuristic rules and election criteria linked to savings, acquiring products or

                       services that are practical and of recognized quality, as well as the speed and efficiency


                       of the actions of information search and purchase at the retailer (Walsh et al, 2017)

                       reviewed by Martinez and Casielles (2018). For example, to stimulate the pragmatic

                       experience, a retailer can offer an assortment of well- known brands with a price-quality

                       ratio and better promotions than those of the competition. The objective is to attract a

                       group of consumers who are interested in obtaining detailed information on prices and

                       promotions, ensure that there are]]></page><page Index="148"><![CDATA[22


                       sufficient  stock  of  the  promoted  products,  or  that  the  quality  of  the  products  is

                       maintained during promotion periods. The retailer can also offer an assortment range

                       that  meets  the  needs  of  customers,  all  types  of  guarantees  and  complementary

                       services (changes, returns, home delivery) or discounts, as well as allowing customers


                       to verify the utility and practical value of some products.

                       Factors Affecting Consumer Preference

                              Lombardo  (2020)  noted  that  consumer  preference  is  defined  as  a  set  of

                       assumptions that focus on consumer choices that result in different alternatives such

                       as happiness, satisfaction, or utility. The entire consumer preference process results


                       in  an  optimal  choice.  Consumer  preferences  allow  a  consumer  to  rank  different

                       bundles of goods according to levels of utility, or the total satisfaction of consuming a

                       good  or  service.  It  is  important  to  understand  that  consumer  preferences  are  not

                       dependent upon consumer income or prices. So, a consumer's capacity to buy goods

                       does not reflect a consumer's likes or dislikes.

                              Hence,  consumer  shopping  preferences  are  defined  as  the  tastes  of  the

                       consumers measured by the perceptions of the usefulness and benefits of the products


                       offered (Guleria et al. 2015 reviewed by Lubis et al. 2017). Shopping preferences are

                       related to whether someone likes or dislikes shopping methods and are not influenced

                       by consumers' purchasing power. This generally affects purchasing decisions. The

                       focus in understanding consumers is the key in keeping consumers (retain) and making

                       it loyal to the seller. Lubis et al. (2017) states that consumers will only become loyal

                       when they are satisfied.


                              Convenience. This factor focused on which consumer preferred whether it's

                       more convenient to shop online or shopping in a store where you can interact with

                       other  people  while  shopping.  According  to  Sarkar  and  Das  (2017),  unlike  offline

                       purchase, in case of online shopping, consumers don’t need to travel all the way to the

                       brick-and-mortar shop, jostle with other consumers during festive seasons and face

                       difficulty finding proper parking space for their vehicles. Online shops are open]]></page><page Index="149"><![CDATA[23


                       24/7 and products are  delivered  to   the   residences   or   offices   of   the customers

                       according to their choice. So, a consumer can just wake up in the middle of the night

                       and  place  an  order  for  a  smartphone  or  some  apparels.  This  is  one  of  the  major

                       reasons for the popularity of online shopping. On the other hand, while the COVID-19


                       pandemic has skyrocketed the growth of online shopping, there is still a large segment

                       of the population that wants to venture away from their computer screens and have in-

                       store experiences. According to Raydiant’s second annual state of consumer behavior

                       report (2021) 46 percent of respondents said that given the choice, shoppers prefer to

                       shop in person rather than online. Managing in-location experiences has never been


                       more stressful. Those who must attract and retain customers to sustain their business

                       have never faced such a complex array of challenges as they do today. Yet, everyone

                       knows that the public still craves in- location experiences.

                              Variety. This factor focused on what consumers prefer the variety of products

                       online or offline. An online shop is a customer’s delight. No offline shop can offer many

                       varieties in different product categories as an online shop can (Sarkar & Das, 2017)

                       Since online shops do not have to bother about space crunch, they can make available


                       large varieties of product at the same place. This large variety gives consumers vast

                       choices  which  were  not  available  before  the  advent  of  this  medium.  The  kind  of

                       selection that a customer gets online is hard to match any product purchased offline.

                       The online retailer’s stock products from the whole major brand and a customer can

                       find any product in their listing no matter how hard to find it in the offline store. Online

                       and  offline  together  shopping  provides  variety  of  choice  from  various  brand


                       (Suthamathi & Jeeva, 2020).

                              Discounts.  This  is  one  of  the  major  reasons  for  consumers  especially

                       youngsters  purchasing  online.  Since  online  sellers  don’t  need  to  go  for  costly

                       decoration  of  their  shops,  employ  large  number  of  salespeople  and  due  to

                       disintermediation, they can offer products and services at a considerable amount of]]></page><page Index="150"><![CDATA[24


                       discounts compared to their brick-and-mortar counterparts (Sarkar & Das, 2017). But

                       in contrast on that Clark, (2020) noted that physical outlets make more sales. Physical

                       stores have mastered the art of selling. Unlike online shops, physical stores manage

                       to sale more products because salesperson can guide clients. In a physical outlet,


                       clients can be guided to where products are located. In the online ones, clients should

                       know the name of a product to search for it. The ability to discover new items. When

                       shopping, clients keep on discovering new products. In an online platform, browsing to

                       search for new items is a never-ending process. Displaying items encourages more

                       shopping. Customers are likely to pick more items than planned because of the way


                       they  are  displayed.  Since  a  physical  store  exposes  customers  to  a  wide  range  of

                       products, sales increase as clients buys extra items.

                              Availability of unique products. This factor focused on which would offer best

                       on unique products offline or online. Nowadays it has become almost a fashion for

                       manufacturers of electronic devices and other product categories to launch their brand-

                       new products exclusively on a particular shopping portal. These products are not at all

                       made  available  in  any  offline  shops  and  only  the  specific  online  portal  gets  the


                       exclusive right to sell the product. In that case, customers are left with no options but

                       to purchase these products on that portal (Sarkar & Das, 2017).

                              Return of products. This factor focused on how easily returning products to

                       its seller can affect the preference of a consumer. According to Sarkar & Das(2017),

                       returning products is something which always pulls down online shopping companies.

                       Whereas in case of offline shops customers can visit the respective shop to exchange


                       their products if not satisfied, in case of online shopping it entails calling up customer

                       care, waiting for the courier for reverse logistics, getting the money back or getting the

                       products exchanged. Sometimes the entire process might take an entire month. Even

                       though  most  of  the  online  shopping  sites  offer  money  back  guarantees or  product

                       exchange facilities, the experience could be harrowing.]]></page><page Index="151"><![CDATA[25


                       Working Class

                              Working class is a socioeconomic term used to describe persons in a social

                       class  marked  by  jobs  that  provide  low  pay,  require  limited  skill,  or  physical  labor.

                       Typically,  working-class  jobs  have  reduced  education  requirements.  Unemployed


                       persons  or  those  supported  by  a  social  welfare  program  are  often  included  in  the

                       working class. While the working class is typically associated with manual labor and

                       limited education, blue collar workers are vital to every economy. Economists in the

                       United States generally define the working class as adults without a college degree.

                       Many members of the working class are also defined as middle-class.


                              Karl Marx described the working class as the "proletariat", and that it was the

                       working class who ultimately created the goods and provided the services that created

                       a society's wealth. Marxists and socialists define the working class as those who have

                       nothing to sell but their labor-power and skills. In that sense, the working class includes

                       both white and blue-collar workers, manual and menial workers of all types, excluding

                       only individuals who derive their income from business ownership and the labor of

                       others.


                              According to Davis (2019) in the Philippines there are five social classes which

                       includes the upper class also called elite, the upper middle class, lower middle class,

                       the working class, and the poor. The working class in the Philippines is also called

                       lower income earners or lower income class.

                              The working class in the Philippines which is also called the country's lower

                       income class but considered as not poor is part of the income class of low income with


                       the cluster of poor. It is defined as between the poverty line and twice the poverty line

                       (Albert et al., 2018).

                              The family in this bracket with the size of 5 members has the range of  monthly

                       income between PHP7,890 to PHP15,780 (Albert et al., 2018). Most of the labor force

                       in this group works 39 hours per week and spend 54 percent of their income on food.]]></page><page Index="152"><![CDATA[26


                       Effects of Pandemic on Shopping Behavior

                              While in-store shopping is still the preferred channel for consumers’ daily or

                       weekly shopping, preference for e-commerce continues to accelerate. According to

                       Global Consumer Insights Pulse Survey (2021) many consumer behavior trends have


                       accelerated during the pandemic, and four essential fault lines have emerged that split

                       global consumers into distinct cohorts.

                              In the Philippines, 42 percent of respondents said they bought clothes, books,

                       and electronics in physical stores in the past 12 months. Some 36 percent highlighted

                       that  the  “ability  to  quickly  and  conveniently  navigate  the  store  to  find  products”  is


                       important when shopping and also said they “prefer to see and touch the products.”

                       The “enjoyment of the social aspects of going to a store” is also noted by respondents

                       (PwC,2021).

                              Increased  health  and  safety  measures,  certification  that  the  store  meets

                       coronavirus  disease  2019  (COVID-19)  safety  standards,  the  availability  of  local

                       products,  having  knowledgeable  and  responsive  sales  associates,  diverse  product

                       range, and the opportunity to pay contactless are important to them when shopping in-


                       person (Valmonte, 2021).

                              However,  the  survey  also  showed  the  preference  for  mobile  shopping

                       continues to increase, even in places in the world where pandemic restrictions have

                       been  lifted.  Respondents  emphasized  the  need  for  a  fast  and  reliable  delivery.

                       Emphasis is also given on the following: reliable service, item availability, and website

                       user experience. In the Philippines, consumers also tend to look for online customer


                       reviews, good returns policy, extended range of stock compared to physical stores,

                       personalized  offerings,  and  memberships  or  loyalty  programs.  The  study  showed

                       YouTube, Google, Facebook, and Instagram to be the top social media platforms most

                       consumers engage advertising in. Meanwhile, PricewaterhouseCoopers (2021) also

                       identified four “fault lines” of consumer]]></page><page Index="153"><![CDATA[27


                       behavior,  which  are:  the  Zoom  effect,  the  generation  gap,  the  “conscientious

                       consumer,” and East-West differences.

                              The Zoom effect noted that employees who work from home are embracing a

                       more digital, environmentally friendly lifestyle compared with those working away from


                       their homes. People primarily working from home are significantly more likely to say

                       they expect to increase their spending across all product categories (PwC, 2021).

                              Work-from-home employees are also almost 10 percentage points more likely

                       to get their groceries online as well. Consumers who work from home are also much

                       more likely to consider the effects of their purchases on the environment, with older


                       consumers more willing to pay a premium for sustainable products.

                              The  second  fault  line  observed  by  PwC  is  the  generation  gap,  which  they

                       explain as: “The youth of today are more likely to shop online and be optimistic about

                       future spending than their older counterparts.” The study also noted that millennials

                       are not as brand loyal. The firm also said that this does not mean younger  consumers

                       are  more  frivolous.  They  are  even  found  to  be  more  price-conscious  than  older

                       consumers, who “place a greater priority on convenience, health and safety than on


                       price or quality.” Meanwhile, the “conscientious consumer” is described as shoppers

                       who have developed new shopping habits as health and safety concerns rose and are

                       pivoting to a “more at-home life.” These consumers shop in-store less in all product

                       categories.

                              It was also found that the rising concern on health and safety expanded to

                       concerns regarding the environment and society. These values are unlikely to change,


                       even after the safety concerns brought on by COVID-19 subside. On the other hand,

                       consumers in the Asia-Pacific region are found to be more sustainably minded and are

                       less likely to be concerned about health and safety in their physical store experiences

                       compared with their Western counterparts. It’s safe to assume that]]></page><page Index="154"><![CDATA[28


                       this could be because the virus has subsided earlier in these countries than in the

                       West (Valmonte, 2021).

                       Online or In-Store Customer Shopping Preferences of Millennials

                              Shopping,  also  known  as  retail  therapy,  in  the  modern  urban  lexicon,  is  a


                       universal pursuit or activity that is worth billions of dollars globally on an annual basis.

                       Consumers  shop  for  automobiles,  food,  clothing,  gadgets,  books,  furniture,  beauty

                       products,  consumer  electronics,  homes,  and  daily  essentials.  The  cumulative

                       processes are governed by underlying modes of behavior that have been classified by

                       marketers as customer shopping preferences. These processes can essentially be


                       delineated  into  online  shopping  and  in-store  buying  because  these  are  the

                       predominant channels of shopping activity.

                              The rise of e-commerce platforms represents a significant form of retail therapy

                       that has emerged in recent years. Online shopping has emerged as a distinct trend in

                       customer  shopping  preferences  driven  by  the  sheer  convenience  and  range  of

                       products offered by e-commerce business operators. Large segments of customers

                       prefer  to  shop  through  e-commerce  portals  because  these  have  become  widely


                       accessible to modern consumers. In response, a growing number of businesses have

                       opened electronic shop fronts in a bid to leverage on emerging customer shopping

                       preferences. Market research reveals that significant numbers of shoppers trust the

                       quality  of  merchandise  being  purveyed  by  e-commerce  operators  and  this  has

                       contributed to tremendous business volumes and transactions registered by these new

                       age business enterprises (Newman, 2017).


                              However, brick-and-mortar businesses continue to present an enduring value

                       proposition to shoppers in many regions and geographies. Customers are spending

                       significant portions of their disposable incomes through in-store shopping sessions

                       because they prize the ability to physically sample the products they seek to buy. This

                       is one of the main planks that distinguishes customer shopping preferences for those

                       consumers that continue to favor traditional business establishments. For]]></page><page Index="155"><![CDATA[29


                       instance, market research reveals that large swathes of shoppers continue to spend

                       significantly on in-store shopping experiences. This understates the fact that multiple

                       generations tend to invest significant equity in the ability to walk into a physical store,

                       savor the ambience, mingle with other shoppers, survey the physical merchandise,


                       and then arrive at a purchase decision. They may state that these shoppers prize the

                       experience and that prompts them to repeat their behavior throughout the year.

                              The millennial generation offers an interesting contrast because this category

                       of shoppers is enamored with the possibilities and capabilities of modern electronic

                       technologies. The millennials could state that this generation is deeply invested in the


                       emerging use of shopping and payment systems that hinge on emerging electronic

                       and  connectivity  technologies.  One  trend  that  confirms  the  above  statements  is

                       premised on observations that millennials depend on mobile apps to arrange for their

                       local and long-distance transportation. This qualifies to be bucketed among modern

                       customer shopping preferences because large numbers of people from this generation

                       use  ride  hailing  apps  to  commute  for  work  and  pleasure.  This  trend  has  created

                       significant  momentum  for  app-based  travel  businesses  at  the  expense  of  certain


                       sectors of the economy, such as automobile manufacturers and sellers. The population

                       could say that this trend will continue to gain steam in the coming years and may alter

                       certain sections of national economies.

                              A contrast in customer shopping preferences emerges when they examine the

                       fact that certain sections of Internet users choose traditional shopping methods when

                       they enter the market for certain categories of goods. Shoppers that are interested in


                       cars, appliances, and jewelry tend to favor in-store shopping because they wish to

                       sample the entire range of merchandise on offer in a visual manner. The color, shape,

                       and  specifications  of  the  above-mentioned  categories  of  merchandise  are  best

                       assessed  in  traditional  business  premises.  Market  research  indicates  that  these

                       shoppers value the tactile experience and wish to pursue face-to-face interactions with

                       in-store salesmen and product experts before they invest in a]]></page><page Index="156"><![CDATA[30


                       certain category of product. This behavior reveals a deeply ingrained faith in traditional

                       shopping models (in-store purchases) and this can be viewed as a durable aspect of

                       consumer behavior. In light of the above, they stated that these shoppers spotlight a

                       certain  trend  in  customer  shopping  preferences  that  continues  to  operate  in  large


                       numbers in the present day. Books, electronic entertainment (such as music, movies,

                       television shows), toys, and games appear to command large customer followings in

                       the online domain. This may underscore customer shopping  preferences that hinge

                       on the sheer convenience of shopping via online mechanisms. Individuals must note

                       that these items of merchandise rank lower in terms of dollar value prompting more


                       and more customers to shop for these items in online domains. Online retailers have

                       realized the significance of this trend and have ramped up their business offerings in

                       an  attempt  to  boost  merchandise  offerings.  In  addition,  these  items  are  typically

                       designed for mass consumption and therefore, it makes business sense to store these

                       at centralized locations and deliver customer orders through e-commerce marketplace

                       mechanisms. Market observers have noted that the preponderance of e-commerce

                       offerings  in  these  types  of  merchandise  has  prompted  many  brick-and-mortar


                       establishments to shut shop because these real- world sites of commerce have proved

                       less competitive to online channels (Newman, 2017).

                              Brands  and  businesses  have  infused  traditional  shopping  paradigms  with

                       electronic  gadgetry  in  an  attempt  to  appeal  to  younger  shoppers.  These

                       establishments acknowledge the fact that they cannot afford to lose the custom of

                       younger  shoppers  and  are  working  to  cater  to  emerging  customer  shopping


                       preferences.  For  instance,  many  traditional  businesses  are  improving  their  market

                       image and commercial allure by installing self-service checkouts and advanced digital

                       payment technologies. These devices are essential to attract and retain technology

                       savvy customers that demand a certain modicum of modern technology in  their  in-

                       store  shopping  experiences.  For  instance,  many  retail  businesses  and]]></page><page Index="157"><![CDATA[31


                       quick service restaurants have invested in the aforesaid technologies in a bid to expand

                       their  customer  base.  The  sheer  convenience  of  self-service  checkouts  and  mobile

                       electronic wallets assures customers that queue will not be their shopping experience.

                       Therefore, people may state that this is an instance of a commercial response to the


                       emerging outlines of customer shopping preferences.

                              In-store shopping experiences gain a slight edge over online commerce when

                       the population because older generations tend to trust the former. Medical science,

                       higher living standards, and better nutrition have enabled prior generations to lead

                       longer lives. This has been acknowledged by businesses and marketing strategists


                       and  so  they  continue  to  invest  significant  capital  to  boost  the  in-store  customer

                       experience. They must note that in-store experiences will continue to be favored long

                       into the future when viewed through the prism of customer shopping preferences. In

                       light of the above, brands and businesses should continue to invest in expanding this

                       mode  of  commerce  and  to  invest  in  human  relationships  with  their  clients  and

                       customers.

                       Synthesis of Related Literature and Studies

                       The researchers found two different studies combined to help this study to be more

                       structured. In study of Sarkar and Das (2017) it was explained the comparison of online

                       shopping and offline shopping. The authors also found out that the population of India,

                       who are the participants of the study, still preferred shopping in physical stores rather

                       than in online stores despite the rapid growth of online sales in India. The second study

                       that helps this research is the study of Martinez and Casielles (2018). However, that


                       study was focused on developing the marketing experience to increase the shopping

                       time, while this proposed study is only focused on determining the shopping preference

                       and  experience  of  the  participants.  The  researchers  only  based  the  factors  of

                       experience  in  the  study  of  Martinez  and  Casielles  in  measuring  the  shopping

                       experience of the participants in this study.]]></page><page Index="158"><![CDATA[32


                              Furthermore, the participants of this proposed research were the working- class

                       millennials.  According  to  (Albert  et  al.  2018)  people  who  are  in  the  cluster  of  low-

                       income class but not considered as poor, and under the age bracket of 22 years old to

                       40 years old. This research will also determine the significant effect of online and offline


                       shopping  experience  to  the  shopping  preference  of  the  participants.  Lastly,  the

                       researchers will identify the differences of online shopping experience and preference

                       to offline shopping experience and preferences of the working-class millennials.]]></page><page Index="159"><![CDATA[33

                              This chapter presents the research design and the sampling techniques used

                       in  selecting  the  participants  of  the  study;  it  also  presents  the  data  gathering


                       procedures, the data analysis, and the statistical treatment to be employed to achieve

                       the objectives of the study.

                       Research Design

                              This  is  a  quantitative  study  with  the  use  of  descriptive-survey  methods.

                       Descriptive research involves gathering data that describe events and then organizes,

                       tabulates,  depicts,  and  describes  the  data  collection  (Glass  &  Hopkins,  1984).

                       Quantitative research uses mathematical forms of expression; such studies are factual


                       and hence supply practical information. The survey research employs applications of

                       scientific  method  by  critically  analyzing  and  examining  the  source  materials,  by

                       analyzing  and  interpreting  data,  and  by  arriving  at  generalization  and  prediction.

                       Hence,  the  descriptive  survey  research  method  will  be  adopted.  Using  descriptive

                       design, the researchers will describe the demographic profile of the participants which

                       includes their age, sex, civil status, monthly income, frequency of buying online and


                       offline, and the products that they bought online and offline, as well as the participants

                       experience and preference towards online and offline shopping during pandemic.

                       Participants of the Study

                              The  participants  of  this  study  were  Working  millennials  in  Cavite.  The  total

                       number  of  participants  that  participated  in  this  study  is  200  participants.  The  first

                       requirement is that the participant is part of the group of working class. The working


                       class includes both white and blue-collar workers, manual and menial workers of all

                       types, excluding individuals who derive their income from business ownership because

                       the target participants of this study is working class and under the age bracket of 26

                       years old to 37 years old which is also called Millennials. The term]]></page><page Index="160"><![CDATA[34


                       Millennials generally refers to the generation of people born between the early 1980s

                       and 1990s, according to the Merriam-Webster Dictionary.

                       Sampling Technique

                              The researchers used the snowball sampling technique in this study. Snowball


                       sample  method  used  for  empirical  data  finding  process.  For  this  study,  firstly

                       questionnaire as designed on a survey administration software (Google Forms) then

                       later the survey links will be sent out to initial contacts who are specific people who live

                       in Cavite; that will be carried out through e-mail or social media. The initial contacts

                       were asked to forward the survey links to others, who they think might be relevant for


                       the  study,  that  are  those  who  currently  live  in  Cavite.  The  researchers  found  this

                       method the fastest way and less costly to gather answers from relevant respondents.

                       For snowball sampling it is not necessary to know the exact amount of population

                       however the sample can be representative of the population (Bryman & Bell, 2018, p.

                       193).

                       Data Gathered

                            The  main  instrument  used  in  this  study  is  the  survey  questionnaire,  which


                       consists of three parts:

                            Socio  demographic  profile  of  the  participants.  This  part  asked  for  the

                       participants’ profile including the name, which is optional, age, sex, civil status, monthly

                       income, frequency of buying online, and products bought online and offline.

                             The  researchers  will  assure  confidentiality  of  their  survey  sheets  since  the

                       identities  are  not  important.  The  researchers  also  understood  that  people’s

                       consciousness  may  also  affect  their  honesty  and  effectiveness  in  answering  the

                       survey, and so, the researchers gave people the option of being anonymous. There


                       were no incentives offered for participating in the research.

                              The socio demographic profile of the participants analyzed and interpreted in

                       terms of descriptive statistics – frequency counts and rating. The participants evaluated

                       the data in terms of their experience towards online and offline shopping during the


                       pandemic where they would check 5 for strongly agree; 4 for agree; 3 for slightly agree;

                       2 for disagree; and 1 for strongly disagree.

                              A  statement  interpretation  will  also  be  used  to  measure  the  degree  of

                       agreement that arises in the questionnaire.

                                                  RESULT AND DISCUSSION



                              This chapter contains detailed presentation and discussion of data analysis and

                       the  results  of  this  study.  The  findings  are  presented  under  the  following  major

                       headings:  demographic  prolife  of  the  participants;  online  and  offline  shopping


                       experience in terms of the given factors; and online and offline shopping preference. It

                       also presents relevant information regarding the problem under study.

                       Reliability Analysis

                              The  survey  type  questionnaire  was  distributed  and  respond  by  thirty

                       participants,  who  are  not  included  in  the  study.  The  Cronbach’s  alpha  reliability

                       coefficient was used to determine its internal consistency before it was administered


                       to  the  actual  participants.  Generally,  the  minimum  acceptable  requirement  of

                       Cronbach’s alpha coefficient should be greater than 0.70 (Hair, et al., 1998; George &

                       Mallery, 2003).

                              Table 2 presents the Cronbach’s alpha reliability coefficients of the constructs

                       under study. It also shows that each factor under online shopping experience and

                       offline shopping experience which has five items per factors reveal to have good to


                       high internal consistency. Therefore, it reached the basic threshold for reliability and

                       had acceptable internal consistency.]]></page><page Index="164"><![CDATA[38

                       Socio Demographic Profile

                              The socio demographic profiles of the participants were collected through the

                       survey type questionnaires using google forms that were distributed to them. The data

                       included the participants age, sex, civil status, monthly income, frequency of buying

                       online and offline, and products bought online and offline.

                              Table 3 revealed that most of the participants (60.00%) belonged to the age

                       bracket of 26-29 years old and are female (61.00%). Most, (67.50%) of the


                       participants are single and have a monthly income (29.00%) of Php7,000 and below.

                       Table 3 also revealed that the participants buy online during pandemic at least once

                       and twice a week (28.50%). This result ties well with the previous study of Kohl

                       (2021) wherein she explained that 26 percent of the respondents stated that they

                       purchased at least once or twice a week online during the COVID-19 pandemic in the


                       Philippines as of May 2020. In contrast, two percent of the participants stated that

                       they buy online during pandemic twice a year. While thirty three percent stated that

                       they buy twice a week offline during pandemic.

                              Figure 2 shows that 123 out of 200 participants bought clothing in online during

                       pandemic, while 156 out of 200 participants bought groceries offline during pandemic.]]></page><page Index="165"><![CDATA[39

                       Significant Difference in Online and Offline Shopping Experience and Preference
                              When Grouped According to their Demographic Profile

                              In this section the researchers determine if there is any significant difference in

                       online and offline shopping experience and preference when grouped according to

                       their  demographic  profile.  Table  16  highlights  the  p-values  resulting  from  the

                       conducted test. The online pragmatic experience has a p-value of 0.007 and therefore

                       it  has  significant  difference  to  age  of  the  participants.  This  means  that  the  online


                       pragmatic experience of working-class millennials has a significant difference to their

                       age. Moreover, the other factors of online and offline shopping experience have no

                       significant difference based on age.

                              The  researchers  also  tested  a  significant  difference  between  shopping

                       preference to age of the participants. Table 17 highlights the p-values resulting from

                       the  conducted  test.  The  two  of  factors  shopping  preference  revealed  to  have  a

                       significant difference based on age of the participants, which are convenience with p-


                       value of 0.021 and discounts with p-value of 0.050. This means that working class

                       millennials  shopping  preference  when  it  comes  to  convenience  and  discounts  has

                       significant  difference  to  their  age.  It  might  be  because  the  age  bracket  of  the

                       participants was under working class classification and as well as being a millennial.

                       Table 16 shows the p-values resulting from the conducted test. The online pragmatic


                       experience has a p-value of 0.007 and therefore it has significant difference to age of

                       the participants. This means that the online pragmatic experience of working-class

                       millennials has a significant difference to their age. Moreover, the other factors of online

                       and offline shopping experience have no significant difference

                       significant difference between monthly income of the participants which is convenience

                       be because the monthly income of the working class is limited so they want to make

                       no  significant  difference  in  online  and  offline  shopping  experience  and  preference

                       when  group  according  to  their  demographic  profile,  except  from  online  and  offline

                       shopping experience to the frequency of buying online during pandemic of the working-

                       class millennials.



                       Conclusion


                              After the analysis of the results, the following conclusions were drawn:


                                 1.   Majority of the participants belonged to the age bracket of 26-29 years

                                     old and are female. Also, majority of them are single and have a monthly

                                     income of 7,000 and below. The working-class millennials are buying

                                     online once and/or twice a week during pandemic and they usually buy

                                     clothes. While they buy offline at least twice a week during pandemic


                                     and buy groceries.

                                 2.  The researchers concluded that the working-class millennials are fond

                                     of  intellectual  experience  while  shopping  online.  For  them  customer

                                     care,  attractive  online  advertisements,  fast  and  hassle-free  mode  of

                                     payment,  and  products  that  are  section  based  on  their  categories

                                     stimulates  great  shopping  experience.  However,  when  it  comes  to

                                     offline  shopping  working-class  millennials  check  attractive  store


                                     designs,  hearing  good  reviews  and  recommendations,  seeing  sale

                                     deals activate their great shopping experience, which all part of sensory

                                 3.  It  was  determined  that  the  majority  of  the  working-class  millennials

                                     preferred  online  shopping  with  regards  to  convenience,  variety,

                                     discounts, and availability of unique products. Although, contradicting

                                     to that the working-class millennials preferred offline shopping when it


                                     comes to return of products.

                                 4.  The  researchers  determined  that  there  is  significant  effect  of  online

                                     shopping experience to shopping preference in terms of variety. Other

                                     than that majority of factors of online and offline shopping experience

                                     has no significant effect towards shopping preference of working-class


                                     millennials.

                                 5.  It was identified that there is no significant difference in online and offline

                                     shopping experience and preference when grouped according to their

                                     demographic  profile,  except  from  the  online  and  offline  shopping

                                     experience to the frequency of buying online during pandemic of the

                                     working-class millennials.

                       Recommendation

                              The researchers further recommend the following:

                                 1.  The  researchers  recommend  to  business  owners  by  making  them

                                     increased quality level, promote discounts and deals to attract more

                                     customers.

                                 2.  Since  the  results  of  the  study  showed  that  millennials  preferred

                                     shopping  online  because  of  its  convenience,  variety,  discounts  and


                                     unique products offered, online shops should continue to provide these

                                     services, while offline shops may improve their services by also offering

                                     these online.

                                 3.  On  the  other  hand,  online  shops  should  improve  their  system  in

                                     returning of products.]]></page><page Index="190"><![CDATA[64


                                 4.  Online  shops  should  add  variety  of  their  products  to  increase  the

                                     positive  experience  of  shoppers.  Moreover,  both  online  and  offline

                                     shops  may  formulate  strategies  that  will  increase  the  frequency  of

                                     buying  online  and  offline  shoppers  by  tapping  their  intellectual  and

                     Preheat pan over medium-low heat, add rice, and continuously stir until rice is a
                       deep brown color, almost black.  Immediately turn off the stove and remove the
                       pan off the stove so the rice doesn’t burn. Be careful not to burn the rice, it will end
                       up tasting like charcoal- the rice needs to be a deep dark brown color.
















                     Add brown sugar. Then, put the burnt rice in the blender so that it becomes a powder.
                       After that, filter it.















                     Put it in a cup, add hot water, stir, and ready to serve.]]></page><page Index="241"><![CDATA[FINAL PRODUCT
