                     be found in Appendix 1.
                     These were also five of seven proposals presented to the Academic Council last May
                     19, 2021.





               OVERVIEW



               On-the-job  training  (OJT)  has  been  widely  accepted  as  important  in  providing  students  the
               opportunity  to  formally  get  acquainted  to  a  real-life  workplace  environment.  For  the  above-
               mentioned undergraduate programs, students from the old curriculum are required to undergo 240
               hours of OJT for them to acquire new competencies and skills needed for their chosen career.
               The new curriculum further recognizes this importance by increasing the requirement to 600 hours.

               Given the nature of OJT, it was not spared from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The batch
               of students who were supposed to enroll last year had to wait for a safer time to do so, during
               which companies are also more prepared to accept and mentor them. They consist of more than
               400  students  who  belong  to  the  last  batch  under  the  old  curriculum  and  are  supposed  to
               graduate in June 2021.
               This paper contains a total of five proposals, one on the implementation of OJT and four on OJT-
               related matters.


               The Objective


                     These proposals aim to serve the need of at least 25% of the entire student population of
                     BSBM and the rest of CEMDS students who are required to enroll in the OJT subject at
                     this point in their study program.




              1]]></page><page Index="6"><![CDATA[It is to the best interest of the students and this University that this batch would be given the
               opportunity to take on the OJT program now to address the following needs:


                 •  Provide the training our students need to be future-ready.
                 •  Produce graduates to help rebuild our economy.
                 •  Prepare an OJT system template for next year’s batch of trainees under the new curriculum.


               The Opportunity


                     Today’s OJT market is very competitive that it challenges and prepares both students
                     and the University on what it is and what is yet to come.



               With reduced business activities due to the pandemic, there is less demand for on-the-job trainees.
               But opportunity knocks on those who are prepared.

               A number of organizations have already expressed interest to welcome trainees including:
                 •  P&A Grant Thornton

                 •  KRAH Pipes
                 •  Nestle Philippines
                 •  CvSU Multipurpose Cooperative
                 •  Philippine Rural Reconstruction Movement
                 •  J&T Express Philippines

                 •  The Memory Building Company (based in Wisconsin, USA)
                 •  Amazon sellers

               Several more are interested to look into our proposal for a college/university-industry partnership.
               The First Cavite Industrial Estate, thru its manager Mr. Rufino Malanyaon, has promised to look
               into our proposal for a tripartite agreement between CEMDS/University, FCIE and the companies
               located in the industrial subdivision. FCIE has more than 100 locators.

               OJT during these times could be more beneficial in the sense that both students and the University
               will have a feel of the new OJT, employment and business landscape that has formed during the
               pandemic. These are still evolving and it is therefore important to be in the middle of the action to
               stay in the loop and remain relevant.

               All we need is to lay a concrete offer for industry partnership which this paper aims to jumpstart.

               Proposal 1 – Allow students to engage in work-from-home OJT.

               In this time of pandemic, work-from-home set-up presents the least risk for student trainees. A few
               companies, including auditing firm P&A Grant Thornton, have already expressed interest to accept
               students and train them thru actual work experience in a work-from-home set-up.

               Training under a virtual assistant or a virtual team will also allow an OJT to entirely work from
               home.

               The usual requirements of these companies are:

                 •  Students must have an internet speed of at least 5-10 Mbps at home.
                 •  Students must be willing or have the means to claim their desktops/laptops from the company.
                 •  Students  must  have  their  own  desktops/laptops  in  case  these  will  not  be  provided  by  the
                    companies.

               As always, only OJTs related to the students’ major will be allowed.

               This proposal hopes to address at least 25% of the demand for OJT this coming midyear break.
               Based  on  the  survey  conducted  among  CEMDS’  potential  OJT  enrollees,  only  50%  have
               computers and stable internet connection at home. Some campuses claim that their percentages
               are lower. Another concern for some students is if they can sustain the cost of continuous use of
               pre-paid internet for the duration of 30 days or more.


               Implementation:

               Student requirements: (All documents will be submitted online and to be sent directly to OJT
               Adviser.)

                   Pre-OJT:
                   1.  Proof of acceptance/communication from company if student applied independently.

                 •  Memorandum of Agreement

                 The old/original OJT Memorandum of Agreement may be used with “work from home” added and
                 some items edited to reflect the nature of work-from-home OJT as shown in Appendix 2.
                 There are provisions for  work-from-home set-up  that have  already undergone review  by  the
                 University  Legal  Counsel,  Atty.  Normida  Hernandez,  and  may  be  readily  included  in  the
                 memorandum if requested by the companies. The review result and revised OJT MOA can be
                 found in Appendix 3 and 4.

                 •  Student grading

                    The company rating will comprise 80% of the students’ grade. This will be based on the old
                    criteria that are stipulated in the OJT MOA. The remaining 20% will be coming from the OJT
                    adviser which will be based on the quality of the submitted narrative.

                 •  Company-to-student trainee evaluation (to use the old evaluation form, Appendix 5)
                 •  Student trainee-to-company evaluation (currently under improvement/development)
                 •  Student trainee-to-college evaluation (currently under improvement/development)






               Proposal 2 – Credit relevant work experience as OJT hours.

               Both employment and self-employment are being referred to in this proposal. Only work experience
               aligned with the students’ major will be credited.

               Some students while waiting for their OJT and subsequent graduation applied for work and got
               accepted in jobs that are aligned with their majors. While some have been working students for
               quite some time.

               A case in point:  Mr. Adrian O. Hayag is a BSBM student major in Service Management Program.
               He has been working in a Business Process Outsourcing company for more than three years now
               and is currently in-charge of internal hiring. Yet he needs to officially take OJT and Internship in
               the BPO industry to graduate.


               Implementation:

                 To gain OJT units by way of crediting relevant work experience, students must be first enrolled
                 to OJT. To apply for crediting, students must ask their Human Resource Manager to send an
                 email to their OJT Adviser and forward employment certificates and detailed job description. If
                 the student is still on probationary status and/or has been with the company for at least 30 working
                 days, the immediate supervisor will have to rate the student using the usual OJT evaluation and
                 this must be sent to the OJT Adviser together with the employment certificate and job description.
                 A narrative on their usual work routine will have to be submitted by the students.

                 For  self-employment,  Ex.  being  a  licensed  insurance  agent/financial  advisor,  a  Financial
                 management or Marketing Management student may claim credit as long as the affiliation with a


              5]]></page><page Index="10"><![CDATA[legitimate insurance company can be proven, proof of licensure is presented, and proof that the
                 student  was  able  to  close  at  least  one  case/policy  that  is  not  for  him  or  herself,  nor  for  an
                 immediate family member. The immediate supervisor will rate our student using the usual OJT
                 evaluation and this must be sent to the OJT Adviser. The students must be enrolled to OJT to
                 claim credit and a narrative on their usual work routine will be submitted by the students.

                 Crediting  of  work  experience  from  employment  or  self-employment  will  have  to  be  strictly
                 reviewed by the OJT advisers, OJT coordinators, department chairs and deans.






               Proposal 3 – Credit entrepreneurial ventures as OJT hours.

               Operating a business is a sure way to earn solid on-the-job training for Bachelor of Science in
               Business Management students of any major.


               Implementation:

                 Students with businesses registered under their name may claim credit by providing a copy of
                 their Department of Trade and Industry Business Registration, Certificate of Registration with the
                 Bureau of Internal Revenue, and proof of active business operation like business records, online
                 business page or website that shows activities for the past 30 working days or longer if the
                 student is less active.

                 A narrative on their usual business and work routine will be submitted by the students.

                 Crediting  of  work  experience  from  employment  or  self-employment  will  have  to  be  strictly
                 reviewed by the OJT advisers, OJT coordinators, department chairs and deans.






               Proposal 4 – Extend the allowable period to finish OJT beyond the customary
               midyear term of around 60 days.

               The enrollment, processing of OJT papers, acceptance of companies, actual training, writing of
               reports, and securing trainer evaluation are traditionally cramped within the midyear term of around
               60 days.

               For students who will be working from home and will be required to use company computers,
               additional time may be needed to process the release of these computers before the students can
               pick them up. It may also take up additional days before computers are returned and students are
               cleared by the companies.

               Since  most  of  the  OJT  students  are  extended  and  have  no  more  subjects  to  take  come  first
               semester AY 2021-2022, it may come as a great help for them to extend the allowable time for the
               students to finish all the requirements of the OJT to minimize occurrences wherein students will
               have to be graded Incomplete which means they would need to extend again for another semester.

               their OJT (240 hours) and Internship (600 hours) in one company,…
               consecutively.


               The last batch of SMP majors from the old curriculum are just waiting to take both their OJT and
               Internship in BPO companies to be able to graduate. Allowing them to take both in one company
               consecutively will unburden the students from having to get admitted to two separate companies
               in this very competitive time period.

                                                       Alyssa R. Genesis



                       A narrative report submitted to the faculty of the Department of Management, Cavite
                       State  University–Tanza  Campus,  Bagtas  Tanza,  Cavite  in  partial  fulfillment  of  the
                       requirements for the program Bachelor of Science in Business Management major in
                       Marketing  Management  with  Contribution  No._____________.  Prepared  under  the
                       supervision of Ms. Melona I. Saquin.



                                                        INTRODUCTION



                              Many  businesses  change  to  working  from  home  when  a  pandemic  strikes,

                       while  schools  and colleges  use  online  learning and modules.  Students must study

                       online to continue learning, and to graduate, they must complete on-the-job training

                       within a set number of hours as part of a college program. It aims to teach, orient, and


                       enhance students' unique qualities as they relate to their work and future careers. For

                       the students to be prepared for their future careers, they must undergo an on-the-job

                       training  program.  As  a  requirement  for  the  Bachelor  of  Science  in  Business

                       Management course, students must undergo virtual on-the-job training that requires

                       them to complete a total of 600 hours of training. It is a type of skill development where

                       a worker learns how to do work through work-from-home hands-on experience (Indeed

                       Editorial Team, 2020).


                              In  addition,  on-the-job  training  is  a  practical  approach  to  acquiring  new

                       competencies and skills needed for a job in a real or close to the working environment.

                       It is often used to learn how to use particular tools or equipment in a live-work practice,

                       simulated, or training environment (Valamis, 2021).

                              Work  from  home  is  an  arrangement  that  allows  you  to  work  outside  the


                       traditional office setting. It is also called remote work or working remotely. Thanks to]]></page><page Index="45"><![CDATA[2


                       new technologies, it is no longer required to be physically present in the office to be

                       productive (Indeed Editorial Team, 2022).

                              Virtual  on-the-job  training  is  essential  to  students  since  it  allows  them  to

                       experience  working  on  a  real  job,  whether  onsite  or  offsite.  Because  they  will  be


                       exposed  to  their  chosen  career's  actual  employment.  This  will  allow  them  to  get

                       additional knowledge, experience, and competencies. This course will help students

                       become more  professional  in  their  interactions with  others.  They  would  be  able to

                       manage such circumstances correctly following the training. They will also know how

                       to collaborate with others or work in groups.


                       Objectives of the Virtual On-the-Job Training

                              Generally, work from home on-the-job training (OJT) aims to orient and train

                       the students in an actual or work-from-home workplace that they may face in the future.

                              Specifically, it aimed to:

                                  1.  improve his future career skills and experience;

                                  2.  focus on workplace traits to gain self-assurance and maturity;

                                  3.  to experience how to work with supervisors, employees, and clients in


                                     a work-from-home setting; and

                                  4.  develop interpersonal skills, professionalism, teamwork, and critical

                                     thinking, discipline, time management, and independence.

                       Significance of the Virtual On-the-job Training

                              Virtual  on-the-job  training  (VOJT)  allows  students  to  put  their  classroom


                       knowledge into practice. They can observe how their lessons are incorporated into

                       work.  During  the  training,  they  can  improve  their  skills  and  creativity.  It  will  also

                       increase students' confidence and attitude in finding a job, whether home or onsite.

                       They can also improve their communication skills by using new technology. Because

                       trainees  are  not  paid,  it  is  also  profitable  for  the  establishment  to  save  money.

                       Moreover, the venture of employees at a business would be easier and faster.]]></page><page Index="46"><![CDATA[3

                              The trainee encountered some problems during the training period. Since the

                       on-the-job  training  is  work  from  home,  there  were  internet  connectivity  problems,

                       power interruption, the game lost connection at the virtual office when there were so


                       many people in one room, and the international SMS that causes the documents to be

                       on hold for the meantime.

                              The trainee suggested that the management provide much understanding and

                       consideration since most of the problems encountered are inevitable.]]></page><page Index="75"><![CDATA[32

                       perform her daily tasks.

                              With the guidance and support of the management and teammates, she was

                       able to gain industry knowledge from the experts and expand her abilities in a relevant


                       office job. She also learned to cherish closeness and interaction with her co-trainees

                       Dear Mr. Ron Oliver Clarin

                              Greetings! I'm Alyssa R. Genesis, a Cavite State University-Tanza Campus
                       fourth-year student. I partially fulfilled my Bachelor's Degree in Business Management
                       with  a  marketing  major.  I  must  complete  600  hours  of  virtual  on-the-job  training,
                       equivalent to 75 days. I heard that ROC.PH Digital Marketing Service is hiring trainees,
                       and I believe I am qualified for the role.
                              I'd want to apply to work as a trainee for your organization because I know the
                       training  and  experience  I'll  get  will  help  me  learn  more  about  my  field.  For  more
                       information, I've attached my curriculum vitae.
                              I am hoping for a positive response to my application. Thank you!



                       Sincerely yours,

                       Day 1: 01 March 2022

                              The trainee serves as a client service at ROC.PH Digital Marketing Services

                       and  started  her  training  on  February  21.  She  started  her  on-the-job  training,  as

                       approved by the University, on March 1, 2022. She enters  the Gather, where they


                       conduct  the  virtual  on-the-job  training.  On  a  primary  day,  Sir  Ron,  their  General

                       Manager, gave all of them a PowerPoint presentation and task to present in the event

                       hall with other co-trainees. He gave them enough time to review and brace themselves

                       for tomorrow's presentation. Also, the trainees began choosing their team leader in the

                       afternoon, and she, along with Angel, Jenny, and Kyle, chose Sir Jaedan as their team


                       leader. Then they went to a private location to introduce themselves to one another,

                       and Sir Jaedan also gave them a glimpse of what he did before becoming a team

                       leader. He also advised them on how to deliver a presentation at the event hall.

                       Day 2: 02 March 2022

                              They had a meeting with Sir Ron in the event hall on the second day of her

                      training. They did a short recitation about  prospecting clients, what ROC.PH offers

                      some situational questions, and she's delighted to report that their team was the most


                      active in responding to Sir Ron's questions. Subsequently, he instructed them to draft

                      their first approach, which they would then deliver to the clients. Prospecting clients

                      was the first real assignment they were assigned. Before the work ends, they go to the

                      Human Resource to get listed for their employee id number.

                       Day 3: 03 March 2022


                              The employee id number was already given to them. Then, they had a new

                      team member, so they practiced giving a power point presentation to them. Sir Jaedan

                      also provided a link to a Trello and Excel spreadsheet where they can keep a record

                      of  their  prospective  clients.  They  also  give  individual  presentations  at  the  spotlight

                      podium in the event hall so that everyone can hear them. Sir Ron immediately criticized

                      her presentation and advised her on how to improve it. The employee id number was

                      already given to them]]></page><page Index="99"><![CDATA[56


                       Day 4: 04 March 2022

                              Sir Jaedan asked them in the morning if they could do with 40 potential clients

                       on an excel spreadsheet. She finished with 40 prospective clients before lunch and

                       began placing them on Trello. Sir Ron then called a meeting with Human Resources


                       and Client Services at 2:40 pm, and while she waited for the others, she briefly talked

                       with other members. Human Resources kicked up the meeting at 3:00 pm, presenting

                       the mission, vision, time in and out, and don'ts.

                       Day 5: 05 March 2022

                              She's present at the virtual office time in, time out, and reports on the fifth day


                       as usual, but the virtual office always lost connectivity, even though she had a strong

                       internet connection. As part of her daily routine, she added several potential clients to

                       Trello, and now that she had a company account, she began familiarizing herself with

                       the platform. April, a new member was added to the team. Then they have a spin the

                       wheel for the presenter with Sir Ron and the client for tomorrow. They arrived at the

                       event hall at 4:40 pm to learn how to operate the company portal.

                       Day 6: 08 March 2022


                              Sir Ron advised them to abandon Trello in favor of the company portal. Their

                       team  leader  usually  demonstrated  how  and  where  to  enter  prospect  clients  in  the

                       company portal. She then began moving potential clients to companies. They held

                       another meeting in the virtual office at 2:30 pm about the company portal. Sir Ron told

                       them where to see the spills, rebuttals, and add leads, how to clock in, and so on.


                       Day 7: 09 March 2022

                              At the company portal, she began converting prospects to leads. Around 1:30

                       pm, they had an urgent meeting where she explained how to use the company portal

                       to send emails, texts, and phone calls. Then submitted a written report on the assigned

                       observer's task on Sir Ace Golez.]]></page><page Index="100"><![CDATA[57


                       Day 8: 10 March 2022

                              Her everyday responsibilities include transferring leads, sending emails, and

                       sending messages, but they now have a lead quota. Unfortunately, she fell short of her

                       quota, but her team had the most leads and was placed first among the other teams,


                       while she was ranked second overall in terms of most leads.

                       Day 9: 11 March 2022

                              She went about her routine and exchanged a few words with her co-trainee.

                       The  observer,  Sir  Ace,  then  coordinated  with  the  team  regarding  the  leads  and

                       assigned them a task on the company portal for the day. Then her team leader had a


                       difficult situation, so the observer took over that day, and Angel made a status report

                       on the group chat where Sir Ron monitored. Their team leader shared his dilemma

                       with the rest of the team and discovered that he didn't belong on the list of enrollments,

                       that his VOJT was void, and that he needed to extend another semester to graduate.

                       His university registrar also advised him to file an LOA because there was no way to

                       correct it. It's shocking to learn of this because he's been a great team leader for us in

                       such a short time.


                       Day 10: 14 March 2022

                              They currently have a problem in that they need to replace their team leader,

                       and no one wants to volunteer to be their team leader; however, everyone wants to be

                       an assistant leader, which is why Angel has no choice but to accept the position of a

                       team  leader  because  she  received  too  many  votes  and  everyone  on  the  team,


                       including  their  observer,  wants  her  to  accept  it.  After  that,  they  went  about  their

                       business,  collecting  leads,  sending  emails,  and  sending  text  messages.  Sir  Ron

                       arrived at their workplace seconds later and inquired if they had their workstation, to

                       which they all replied that they did not. Sir Ron then guided and assigned them to their

                       workstation. The time is 3:20 pm. They discuss with Sir Ron the obligations of being a

                       team leader and assistant team leader. Because one of their assistant team leaders

                       cannot attend, Alyssa has chosen to represent her sub-team.]]></page><page Index="101"><![CDATA[58


                       Day 11: 15 March 2002

                              Everything has been routine in collecting leads, sending emails and texts, and

                       meeting  with  Sir  Ron,  but  things  have  changed.  Sir  Ron  approaches  each  team's

                       observer and inquiries about how things are going, whether they've met their quota,


                       and how many leads they've generated in each call update. Then, after a few minutes,

                       the results were announced, and Sir Ron awarded a reward to the team with the most

                       leads, even posting it on the corporate portal, and they were not chosen.

                       Day 12: 16 March 2022

                              Everything  has  been  routine  till  now:  collecting  leads,  sending  emails  and


                       messages, and meeting the quota is important; it will affect your performance if it does

                       not meet. Ace gave the team encouraging words to achieve their goal, 100 leads per

                       person and 700 leads per team.

                       Day 13: 17 March 2022

                              She did 50 leads on Palawan in the morning and another 50 in the afternoon,

                       but she struggled to reach 100 leads due to corporate matches with another team.

                       Day 14: 18 March 2022


                              The daily routine continues as usual, but at 10:30 am. They will have to visit

                       the clinic for a consultation. Everyone is having a good time at the clinic, as they started

                       to  assist  them  to  relax  by  giving  them  puzzles  to  solve  to  give  their  brain  a  little

                       exercise. They held a meeting with Sir Ron in the afternoon because they were having

                       problems sending emails, and he instructed them on how to send emails differently.


                       Day 15: 21 March 2022

                              She collected 50 leads in the morning and another 50 in the afternoon, and one

                       of her leads responded to an email sent to her. They had an instruction that if the

                       prospect responded to the email, they should notify Sir Ron. And when she told Sir

                       Ron about it, he didn't say anything, so she told her observer about it. When she told

                       her observer that Sir Ron didn't say anything, the observer got it and told her to be on

                       standby about the client. At 1:00 pm, there will be a program.   She went to a meeting]]></page><page Index="102"><![CDATA[59

                       for  a  consultation  at  10:30  am.  She  enjoyed  listening  to  the  presenter even  if  she

                       couldn't participate because her laptop was not functioning well. Then in the afternoon,

                       she only does 25 leads, and she has struggled to meet her quota because her laptop

                       frequently hangs and freezes. Then, by 2:00 pm, meeting with Sir Ron at the event hall

                              She completed 50 leads in the morning and then quickly met with the team

                       through messenger regarding unassigned leads. Another 50 leads were obtained in

                       Bacolod City this afternoon.

                              Another day to finish the 100-lead quota. Then, around 2:00 pm, she submitted


                       a google form for the clinic department on the stress factor and post-internship.

                       Day 21: 30 March 2022

                       with  Sir  Ron  in  the  event  hall  at  8:15  am  to  discuss  the  concerns  about  client

                       informing Sir Ron about the client response and setting up an appointment. The HR

                       the client's portal by tomorrow. At 3:00 pm, they held a meeting with the sales team

                       and Ms. Stephanie, the head of Client Services, to discuss the client portal for how to

                       send an email.

                       the afternoon on the same day. Early in the morning, the account for the clients' portal

                       was given to them privately. They had already sent their first email through the client

                       portal at 10:00 am. At 4:30 pm, they had an appointment with Sir Ron in Room 001 for


                       Online Kamustahan. They were asked how they were doing, what difficulties they were

                       having, and whether they had met their quota. Everyone on the team is concerned

                       about  how  difficult  it  is  to  obtain  leads  nowadays,  as  well  as  the  time  spent  in

                       attendance.

                       Day 23: 1 April 2022

                              She only had 18 leads in the morning for today's lead. She attended a wellness

                       session at the wellness hall with the entire sales team at 10:30 am as part of the clinic


                       department's program. In the afternoon, she had 17 leads but 83 unassigned leads to

                       whom  she  had  previously  sent  an  email  and  a follow-up  message.  The  team  also

                       gathered  with  Sir  Ron  in  Room  001  to  discuss  leads,  CRM,  how  to  respond,  and

                       rebuttals.

                       day and was slated to begin a kick-off program with Sir Ron at 1:00 pm, but it was

                       canceled owing to Sir Ron's schedule. He informed them that he had an important

                       Day 25: 5 April 2022

                              Because the company portal does not have enough storage for leads, they will

                       send emails and SMS until all their unassigned leads have been used. She sent 129

                       unassigned leads by email and SMS during the rest of the day.


                       Day 26: 6 April 2022

                              She emailed and sent SMS to 70 unassigned leads in the morning, but the

                       company portal auto-send was discontinued before  10:00 am, so she had to send

                       emails through the client portal by the afternoon. Because the client's portal was so

                       slow, she only did seven unassigned leads. Overall, she got 77 unassigned leads.


                       Day 27: 7 April 2022

                              They had to utilize the client's portal to send emails because the auto-send in

                       the  company  portal  was  not  working  early  in  the  morning.  She  emailed  eight

                       unassigned  leads  in  the  morning  and  eight  in  the  afternoon.  She  was  frustrated

                       because the client's portal was very slow.

                       Day 28: 8 April 2022

                              This  day  has  two  meetings  scheduled:  one  in  the  morning,  which  is  a


                       mandatory general meeting briefing in the event hall from 8 to 9 am, but it started at

                       8:50 am because Sir Luis, the human resource and finance manager, was late. It was

                       all about continuing orientation, but it's also about work ethics and behavior. Then, at

                       10:30 am, they get a consultation at the wellness hall, where they stretch and answer

                       riddles and the day's questions. The other meeting, which took place from 11 am to 12


                       pm, was to congratulate the accounts department on successfully forming it in the

                       event hall. They also discuss the accounts department's responsibilities. After taking a

                       lunch break, they began contacting leads from the client's portal. They also conduct a

                       brief team discussion to discuss the client's response and how to transfer it to the

                       accounts department. John Mark Badua represented their accounts department, and

                              She had no idea how to feel when she couldn't log in to the client's portal and

                       discovered that her colleagues couldn't either. Since they couldn't send emails or add

                       leads to the company portal, they had no options but to wait and do nothing. Sir Ron


                       and the engineering team were contacted about a login failure on the client's portal,

                       and  they  responded  that  they  are  working  hard  to  resolve  the  issue  as  soon  as

                       however, only the team leader and assistant team leader have access to the client's

                       portal, and all sales team members will not have access to it until they shift to the

                       accounts department. They were immediately kicked out of the virtual office after lunch

                       at about 1:20 pm, but the situation was resolved quickly, and they could return to the

                       virtual office. She also sends SMS follows up to 20 leads.

                       they conducted a quick team meeting through messenger discussing the team leader

                       and  assistant  team  leader  meeting,  where  they  shared  what  they  had  discussed

                       previously. The current ATL will be transferred to the accounting department, leaving

                       an opening for an Assistant Team Leader. In the afternoon, she works on sending SMS

                       got a better stable internet connection and started the game. It was so fun not because

                       the players were confused about how they escaped but because the host was very

                       funny.  Sir  Ash  and  Sir  Eldin  are  the  primary  sources  of  the  laughing  chats  in  the

                                           ROC.PH DIGITAL MARKETING SERVICES



                                                       Jofhel D. Morada



                       A narrative report submitted to the faculty of the Department of Management, Cavite
                       State  University–Tanza  Campus,  Bagtas  Tanza,  Cavite  in  partial  fulfillment  of  the
                       requirements for the program Bachelor of Science in Business Management major in
                       Marketing  Management  with  Contribution  No._____________.  Prepared  under  the
                       supervision of Ms. Melona I. Saquin.



                                                        INTRODUCTION



                              An  internship  is  an  excellent  opportunity  to  develop  every  student  or

                       professional to gain hands-on experience in an area they are interested in or want to

                       enter. Traditional  in-person  internships  are  no  longer  a  realistic  option  for  most

                       students after learning to adjust to studying at home. As a result, virtual internships


                       have become a great option since the start of the coronavirus pandemic (Chloe Lane,

                       2022).

                              The  internship  program  is  designed  to  provide  students  engaged  in  a  field

                       experience with an opportunity to share their insights to explore students' academic

                       preparation and their fieldwork. Internship training is necessary not just for teaching

                       students about their chosen profession but also for showing them how to work in the

                       real world. Students may not have experience internship in the actual workplace, but


                       they  already  experience  it  during  their  senior  high  school.  For  the  student  to  be

                       prepared for the future system of work until the pandemic is still immersing the country,

                       the governments implemented work from on-the-job home training for all graduating

                       students.  As  a  requirement  for  the  Bachelor  of  Science  in  Business  Management

                       course, students must undergo work from on-the-job home training, which requires


                       them to complete 600 hours of training. It is a form of skill development in which a]]></page><page Index="128"><![CDATA[2


                       worker learns how to do work through hands-on experience at home (Frostburg State

                       University, 2022).

                              The  Covid-19  pandemic  advanced  this  development  by  requiring  a

                       considerable portion of the world workforce to convert to WFH temporarily. According


                       to  Ruiz  et  al.  (2006),  e-learning  is  more  effective  than  face-to-face  techniques  in

                       learning and attitudes. Virtuality-based training provides 50-60% better results than

                       face-to-face  training  since  the  learning  process  is  more  controlled.  Individual

                       differences can be addressed through the use of a diverse range  of materials and

                       activities,  such  as  games,  tests,  and  practice  exercises,  among  others  (Bachman,


                       2000),

                              Virtual internships offer many benefits in building interns’ careers by providing

                       them with unique learning experiences (Alipour et al., 2020).

                              Advanced  training  can  give  employees  the  tools  and  skills  they  need  to

                       succeed  in  a  remote  environment  while they  are  still  in  the  in-person, face-to-face


                       environment they are used to (Lin Grensing-Pophal, 2020)

                              Several  organizations,  such  as  the  National  Association  of  Colleges  and

                       Employers  (NACE),  have  adopted  tight  rules  for  internship  programs  to  address

                       growing concerns about the legality of unpaid employment and the educational value

                       of  such  programs.  It  is  instructive  to  think  about  as  we  analyze  online  internship

                       experiences. The generally cited definition provided by NACE is based on the belief

                       that  "An  internship  is  a  meaningful  learning  experience  benefiting  the  student,  not


                       merely an operational work experience that just happens to be handled by a student."

                       (Hora et al., 2021)

                              WFH  offers  the  ability  to  reduce  commuting  time,  allow  more  flexible  work

                       hours, and boost career opportunities compared to working from the office. It increases

                       work-life balance and job happiness. However, little is known about some of WFH's


                       more  fundamental  effects,  such  as  its  effects  on  production  and  the  factors  that

                       influence whether WFH is more or less productive than WFO (Gibbs et al., 2021)]]></page><page Index="129"><![CDATA[3


                       Objectives of the On-the-Job Training

                              Generally, virtual on-the-job training (OJT) aims to orient and train the students

                       in a real or work-from-home workplace that they may face in the future.

                              Specifically, it aimed to:


                              1.  develop knowledge and skills by performing in a virtual work setting;

                              2.  enhance  a  sense  of  professionalism,  a  passion  for  their  work,  and  a

                                 commitment to the people they serve;

                              3.  gain experience by working in the new system of work; and

                              4.  enhance self-discipline, time management, patience, resourcefulness, and


                                 proactiveness needed for this work setup.

                       Significance of the On-the-job Training

                              On-the-job training (OJT) helps the student to have knowledge and skills. Since

                       technology and workplace methods change over time, professionals must keep up with

                       the changes. Training is one of the most effective strategies to improve knowledge and

                       abilities.  Providing  appropriate  and  consistent  training  to  employees  can  assist

                       increase workplace performance and efficiency.


                       Time and Place of the On-the-job Training

                              The training was conducted from March 1, 2022, to June 11, 2022, with the

                       allotted  600  training  hours  at  ROC.PH  Digital  Marketing  Services  at  Blk98  Lot25

                       Observed Strength of the Training Area

                                  The trainee observed that the management and staff treated each intern with

                       care. Every week the intern had to fill out a weekly form regarding their stress factors,

                       which an intern completed, and they had to do clinic wellness every Friday, provided


                       by the clinic department. They were able to keep the intern entertained while offering

                       support and guidance. The trainee noticed open internal communication, which made

                       them feel more at ease.

                       Problems Encountered

                                  During the training time, the trainee encountered some difficulties with the time


                       allocated to complete the task. There are times when technical difficulties prevent the

                       intern from completing her job.

                              The trainee suggested that management have enough quota so that sending

                       email  proposals  to  clients  through  Bitrix  (company  portal)  is  not  difficult,  and  the

                       process is efficient and reliable.]]></page><page Index="143"><![CDATA[17


                                                          SUMMARY



                              Internships  provide  a  wealth  of  early  career  opportunities  and  experiences.

                       Working as an intern allows you to put what you've learned into practice in a real-world


                       or virtual setting.

                              The training at ROC.PH Digital Marketing Services started officially when the

                       trainee was enrolled in the program. The University approved to convert her working

                       hours into on-the-job training hours as the trainee was already part of the company as

                       a sales member since March 1, 2022. Her task is to find prospecting clients and input


                       the leads in Bitrix (company portal) to send email proposals. Throughout the training,

                       the trainee continued to perform her daily tasks, such as adding new leads, sending

                       proposals, and sending follow-up emails to prospective clients. Before her exit day,

                       she was tasked with deducting compliance and assisting interns’ payments.

                              She gained knowledge and developed her skills by performing this virtually with

                       the help of her general manager, office staff, and her team. Even though she was

                       apprehensive  about  the  internship  mainly  because  it  was  virtual,  experiencing  this


                       opportunity has been integral for the intern to identify what future career she will take

                       through the experience in the workplace.]]></page><page Index="144"><![CDATA[18

                       Blk 98, Lot 25, Beaumont St., Village 3, Metro South Subdivision General Trias, Cavite,
                       Philippines

                       Dear Mr. Clarin:

                       Greetings!

                       Cavite State University – Tanza Campus promotes the advancement of our students
                       by  providing  them  the  structure  and  support  to  achieve  competency  in  the  core
                       disciplines  of  Business  Management.  We  recognize  that  strong  partnerships  with
                       reputable organizations through internships provide our students with various activities
                       that offer exposure to the current application of appropriate knowledge, skills, tools,
                       and techniques at work.

                       In this regard, we seek for your esteemed company to host the internship of Ms. Jofhel
                       D. Morada, a Fourth-year BS Business Management student, and accommodate her
                       in a role or defined project that could create real value for your company and extend a
                       unique opportunity for our student to get real-life work experience and mentorship in
                       her field. She majors in Marketing Management.

                       This student is required to complete 600 internship hours, which would be on a work-
                       from-home setup due to the current pandemic.

                       We believe that your company can assist our students in gaining more knowledge and
                       skills and optimizing their potential for their future work.

                       We look forward to a fruitful partnership with you. Thank you very much.

                       Very truly yours,

                       Day 1: 1 March 2022

                              The trainee has been employed at ROC.PH Digital Marketing Services since

                       March 1, 2022. She started her on-the-job training, as approved by the University, on

                       February 20, 2022. She was excited for her first day as an intern. It was difficult for her


                       to log in because her laptop refused to cooperate, but she enjoyed it because the

                       virtual office character is adorable, which the intern is free to change. The interns are

                       separated  into  four  groups.  Ms.  Steph  was  her  team  leader,  and  she  was  with

                       Chimniedel, Mary Rose, and Kimberly. Their group was called the sales team group.

                       After that, the sales team group goes to the meeting room, and the team leader adds


                       all her groupmates on Facebook to stay updated. Ms. Sheryl sent the employee ID

                       number.

                       Day 2: 2 March 2022

                              She woke up early on the second training day because she was late on her first

                       day. During the morning, the general manager, Sir Ron, and her team leader Ms.Steph

                       discussed how to present correctly. After that, she sent a request to Sir Ron to access

                       the  spreadsheet  of  prospecting  clients.  At  9:37  am,  she  still  didn’t  have  the


                       spreadsheet access, so she practiced for her presentation. She is with Chimniedel,

                       Kim, and Mary Rose in the sales deck office. At exactly 10:45 am, she was still looking

                       for a prospective client. She only used Google to search for the businesses around

                       Luzon.  It’s  11  am.  She  got  five  prospective  clients.  From  1  pm  to  4  pm,  Sir  Ron

                       discussed how to approach the clients virtually. It should be this ‘Good Day! I’m Joel


                       from ROC.PH, may I know what the best time to call you is? Or what is your best email

                       so I can send you an email proposal? He also asked, what if the client can’t afford your

                       services? So ROC.PH has a program in which they are offering discounts.]]></page><page Index="166"><![CDATA[40


                       Day 3: 3 March 2022

                              Early in the morning, the trainee ate breakfast and took a bath. She attempted

                       to get in at 7:45 am but could not do so until 7:50 am. She's still figuring out how to do

                       things  electronically,  and  her  laptop  isn't  particularly  fast.  After  arriving  at  the


                       workplace,  the  trainee  completed  the  customer  prospecting  task  and  entered  the

                       information into a spreadsheet. She finished the 20 prospect clients at 10:58 am and

                       is now preparing for her presentation later. At 1:00 pm, all interns were at the event

                       hall to give their presentations. She maintained her searching for a potential client while

                       others were presenting. The trainee could not present; however, she will do so the


                       following day.

                       Day 4: 4 March 2022

                              All  interns  gathered  at the  event  hall  to finish  the  presentation they started

                       yesterday. She practiced her lines while waiting for the general manager. At 9:42 am,

                       it  was  her  turn  to  present,  and  she  finished  at  9:49  am.  The  trainee  felt  nervous

                       throughout the presentation, but her general manager said that how she presented

                       was fine but that she should include adlibs on what the firm does. Steph taught all

                       Day 6: 8 March 2022

                              The trainee continued her client prospecting task before being transferred to

                       the old web development workstation. The intern met with the general manager in the

                       afternoon and discussed using the company portal.  She tried to add a task in the


                       company  portal.  The  trainee  had  set  a  deadline  for  transferring  leads,  which  is

                       tomorrow.

                       Day 7: 9 March 2022

                              The  trainee  continued  to  transfer  leads  in  the  morning  and  completed  20

                       transfers. The intern met with the general manager in the afternoon to discuss how to


                       transfer  leads  and  send  email,  text,  and  phone  calls  to  clients,  and  the  general

                       manager, Sir Ron, ordered the intern to finish 50 leads.

                              In the morning, I begin my day by seeking potential clients and putting their

                       information into a spreadsheet before submitting it to the company portal (Bitrix). Sir

                       Ron directed that each team leader keep a record of how many leads their members

                       transferred at 11 am, 2 pm, and 4 pm. It put me under pressure because it would not


                       be easy to produce 100 leads per day. She transferred 26 leads at 11 am and found

                       clients for the following few hours. She had transferred 18 leads by 2 pm and was still

                       looking for potential clients. She transferred 15 leads at exactly 4 pm. In addition, the

                       40 prospects. She taught Mary Rose how to send emails and SMS to clients. She then

                       created a task in the company portal (Bitrix) for client prospecting and input lead, with

                       presenting.  I sent her an email proposal once more, but she's never replied because

                              Since the team leader and assistance team leader had access to WHMCS, the

                       trainee had followed up on her ten leads. Because there was a technical issue in the
