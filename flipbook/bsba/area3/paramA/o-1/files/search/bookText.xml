                                                       application of mathematical tools in daily life. The course
                                                       begins with an introduction to the nature of mathematics as
                                                       an exploration of patterns (in nature and the environment)
                                                       and as an application of inductive and deductive reasoning.
                                                       By exploring these topics, students are encouraged to go

                                                       a set of formulas but as a source of aesthetics in patterns of
                                                       nature, for example, and a rich language in itself (and of

                                                       tool for understanding and dealing with various aspects of

                              The study was conducted to determine the acceptability and usage of cashless

                       payment  systems  among  the  working-class  millennials  in  Tanza,  Cavite.  It  was

                       conducted in Tanza, Cavite from September to January 2022. It specifically aims to;

                       determine the socio-demographic profile of the participants in terms of age, sex, civil


                       status, monthly income, frequency of using cashless payment per week and purpose

                       of  using  cashless  payment;  identify  the  perceived  level  of  acceptance  of  selected

                       working-class millennials towards cashless payment system in terms of benefits, trust,

                       self-efficacy, ease of use and security; determine if the perceived level of acceptance

                       of selected working-class millennials has influence on their usage of cashless payment

                       system; and identify if the profiles of the participants have significant relationship to

                       their perceived level of acceptance and usage of cashless payment system.


                              The  study  used  descriptive-correlation  design  to  collect  data  on  the

                       participants’ socio-demographic profile, perceived level of acceptance and usage of

                       cashless payment among working-class millennials in Tanza, Cavite. The relationship

                       of  demographic  profiles  to  perceived  level  of  acceptance  and  usage  of  cashless

                       payment system among working-class millennials was also described.


                              The data was gathered from the responses of 150 working-class millennials in

                       Tanza, Cavite and who are using cashless payment system. Purposive sampling was

                       used in selecting the participants from Tanza, Cavite.

                              The study revealed that majority of the participants have high acceptability on

                       cashless payment system in terms of benefits, trust, self-efficacy, ease of use and

                       security. On the other hand, their perceived level of acceptance has high influence on

                       their usage of cashless payment system.

                              This  study  was  conducted  to  determine  the  level  of  extension  program

                       participation towards the social entrepreneurial intention of selected beneficiaries of

                       Cavite State University-Tanza Campus extension program in Bagtas, Tanza, Cavite.


                       The  researcher  gathered  data  from  September  2021  to  December  2021.  It

                       specifically aimed to determine the demographic profiles of the participants; identify

                       the extension program activities participated by the extension program beneficiaries

                       of  CvSU-Tanza  Campus;  determine  the  perceived  level  of  extension  program

                       participation of the beneficiaries; identify the significant effect of participating in the

                       extension  program  activities  towards  social  entrepreneurial  intentions  in  terms  of


                       social  norms,  desirability,  self-efficacy,  feasibility  and  propensity  to  act;  and

                       determine  the  significant  relationship  of  profiles  to  the  level  of  extension  program

                       participation and social entrepreneurial intentions.

                              The  research  design  that  was  used  in  this  study  is  descriptive-correlation

                       method. The descriptive-correlation method was used to describe the profile of the

                       participants, extension program participation and social entrepreneurial intentions of


                       the  extension  program  beneficiaries  of  Cavite  State  University  –  Tanza  Campus

                       Extension Program. It was also used to determine the significant effect of extension

                       is a significant difference between buying behavior in age and employment status. The

                       were female, and most of them were employed and had monthly incomes ranging from

                       buying behavior. Marketers can collect ideas about the typologies of online shoppers

                       and their buying behavior. Also, this study would help the psychologist to understand

                              The study was conducted from September 2021 to January 2022 at Tanza,


                       Cavite to determine the effects of community quarantine on the business performance

                       of selected micro, small and medium enterprises in Tanza, Cavite. Specifically, the

                       study  aimed  to:  determine  the  business  profile  of  the  participants;  determine  the

                       perceived effect of community quarantine on the business operational performance of

                       micro, small and medium enterprises; determine the perceived effect of community

                       quarantine  on  the  business  financial  performance  of  micro,  small  and  medium


                       enterprises;  and  determine  if  there  is  a  significant  difference  of  the  business

                       performance  of  selected  micro,  small  and  medium  enterprises  when  grouped

                       according to profile.

                              The descriptive design was used to describe the business profile, the effects of

                       community  quarantine  on  the  business  performance  of  selected  micro,  small  and

                       medium  enterprises,  and  the  significant  difference  in  the  business  performance  of


                       selected micro, small and medium enterprises when grouped according to profile.

                              The data were gathered from the responses of 31 participants in Tanza, Cavite

                       from  September  2021  to  January  2022.  Furthermore,  the  researchers  used

                       convenience sampling in selecting the participants.

                              As a result, most of the micro, small and medium enterprise in Tanza, Cavite

                       were in the service form of business which is a sole proprietorship type of business

                       organization  and  operating  between  one  to  two  years  and  was  classified  as  a


                       microenterprise.  It  was  determined  that  the  participants  strongly  agree  that  the

                       community quarantine has an effect on customer focus and management support on



                                                               xii]]></page><page Index="125"><![CDATA[the operations of the business while they agree on supplier management. In terms of

                       profitability and liquidity, it was revealed that they maintain the financial performance

                       of the business. Thus, they agree that it has no effect on their financial performance.

                       There is a significant difference in terms of supplier management and liquidity in terms


                       of the nature of the business but there is no significant difference in terms of the type

                       of business organization, years of operation, and classification of enterprise on factors

                       such as operational and financial performance.

                              The  researchers  concluded  that  some  of  the  participants  engaged  in  the

                       services business, the majority are sole proprietors, have 1-2 years of operation and


                       the majority are microenterprises. Customer focus and management support of the

                       businesses were changed under community quarantine. Their business implemented

                       new  policies  and  safety  protocols,  and  they  improved  their  relationship  with  their

                       suppliers.  They  also  maintained  their  business  liquidity  and  profitability. There  is  a

                       significant difference in supplier management and liquidity in terms of the nature of the

                       business but no significant difference in the type of business organization, years of

                       operation, and classification of an enterprise.


                              The researchers recommend that more variables can be employed in future

                       studies to measure the business performance of the MSMEs. Future studies can widen

                       the scope of the sample to get more information on the effects of community quarantine

                       to the business performance in Cavite. The participants’ business practices may be

                       used  by  other  businesses  in  formulating  their  own  strategies  in  operational


                       performance to improve their liquidity and profitability.
