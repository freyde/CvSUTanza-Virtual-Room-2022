The implementation of Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ)                in various regions in the country poses issues and challenges among HEIs wherein faculty,                students and administrators need to face.  Classes in all levels were suspended – face-to-face                teaching  and  learning  stopped  including  all  other  online  learning  activities  since  not  all                students  and  faculty  had  reliable  internet  connection  at  home.  Temporary  closure  affects                40,819 students, 1508 teaching and 590 non-teaching staff of Cavite State University.                         In  response  to  the  threats of  this  global  COVID-19 pandemic,  the  Commission on                Higher  Education  (CHEd) has  recommended  the  implementation  of  a  flexible  system  for                the reopening    of   classes   of   colleges   and   universities   in   the   country   for                school year 2020-2021 (Manila Times, 05 May 2020). CHED Chairperson De Vera explained                that  “under  a  flexible  learning  system, schools  adjust  the  learning  process  based  on  the                location of the students and the structure of the learning system. It includes online and offline                activities.”                         Given the unprecedented challenges of this global pandemic to HEIs,  Cavite State                University has quite significantly initiated plans to reshape the learning management system                that will address the needs and situations of its thousands of students ensuring the highest                degree possible of inclusion and equity in education.                          The following outlines the post ECQ plan of Academic Affairs for the undergraduate                and  graduate  students  in  the  Main  and  Satellite  Campuses  using  the  flexible  learning                arrangement to be implemented effective upon approval:                                          FLEXIBLE LEARNING ARRANGEMENT                         Cavite State University shall implement the  Flexible learning arrangement which                will permit the 1) redesigning of the syllabi to fit to the alternative modes of learning, 2)                the  use  of  both  digital  and  non-digital  modes  of  teaching  and  learning  and  3)                adjustment  on  the  schedules  for  flexible  learning.  This  learning  system  will  provide                learners  with  choices  about  when,  where  and  how  learning  occurs  using  a  range  of                technologies and available materials to support the teaching and learning process.                _____________________________                  * Prepared  by  the  Office  of  the  Vice  President  for  Academic  Affairs  and  approved  by  virtue  of                Administrative Council Resolution No. 13, series of 2020 dated May 10, 2020                                                          Page 1 of 9","Republic of the Philippines                                             CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY                                          Don Severino de las Alas Campus                                                      Indang, Cavite                                                    www.cvsu.edu.ph                        I.

During  the  first  day  of  classes,  faculty                               members should sign the registration forms of their students and                               collect their class cards or registration forms. The class cards serve                               as evidence that the students are officially enrolled in the class.                                          A  student  is  considered  officially  enrolled  only  after  the                                          following steps are satisfied:                                          University Registrar has duly certified the enrollment on                                          the registration cards.                                          University Cashier has stamped on the required forms an                                          acknowledgement of payment of fees, and                                          Professors/instructors  have  placed  their  initials  or                                          signatures on the registration cards.                                      The  class  list,  issued  by  the  Office  of  the  University                               Registrar, provides the name of the students, regular or irregular,                               officially  enrolled  in  a  course.  Faculty  members  should  get  their                               class lists from their Department Head on the first day of classes.

It  is                               recommended  that  the  students  be  provided  with  a  copy  of  the                               course syllabus.                            e)  Class Meetings and Dismissal of Classes. Punctuality should  be                               observed at all times in the conduct of classes. If the class should                               start at 7 a.m., the faculty should be in the classroom at exactly                                 7 a.m. Classes should be dismissed at least five (5) minutes before                               the end of each period to allow students to move and transfer to                               their next class.                            f) Make-Up Classes.

Make-up  activities/classes  should  be  for  both  extra  and  regular                               teaching  assignments.
