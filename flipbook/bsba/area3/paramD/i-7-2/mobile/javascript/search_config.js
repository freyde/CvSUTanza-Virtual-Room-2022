The growth in the market can be attributed to the increasing prevalence of Hospital-Acquired                Infections (HAIs), along with the presence of favorable regulations concerning the usage of                surface disinfectants in diagnostic laboratories, hospitals, research laboratories, and                 pharmaceutical \& biotechnology labs, among others. Growing cases of chronic diseases are                also projected to help boost market growth over the forecast period. Increasing consumer                awareness about hygiene and preventive healthcare is also driving the demand for surface                 disinfectants.                 lll.

Product Concept                      Powdered milk, also called dried milk, or milk powder, is a manufactured dairy                  product made by evaporating milk to dryness. One purpose of drying milk is to preserve it;                 milk powder has a far longer shelf life than liquid milk and does not need to be refrigerated,                 due to its low moisture content. Another purpose is to reduce its bulk for the economy of                 transportation.                      According to Customized report service(2019),Canada is the third largest import source                  of powdered skim milk for the Philippines, after the United States (U.S.) and the European                 Union (EU). Imports of powdered skim milk from Canada have grown 62.8% annually over                 the past five years (2013-2017). The Philippines relies almost 100% on imports for all its                 dairy needs. The U.S. is the largest powdered skim milk supplier to the Philippines with                 84.1% of total imports, followed by the EU (13.4%), and Canada (2.0%). Imports from New                 Zealand and Australia have duty free access for dairy products through Association of                 Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) agreements.                       Milk powder is among the several pasteurized form of fresh milk with all the necessary                  efficient nutrients such as standard amino acids, the building blocks of proteins, and are high                 in soluble vitamins and minerals. Due to its powder form and mobility it is a common item in                 the UN food supply program addressing hunger and food security and it longer shelf life                 augments its retail value in supermarkets. Increasing number of births and child population                 are the major factors affecting the global powdered milk market size.","II.

For the same period, there has been a 3.0% annual increase                 in the retail sales of powdered skim milk in the Philippines. Nestle, Royal Friesland Campina,                 and Fonterra are the market leaders with their brands mainly targeting the country's                 low-income population, which is around 82 million people, or 80% of 103 million people.                 Filipino consumers shop almost daily on a needs basis in small, traditional grocery stores,                 which make up the largest distribution channel for drinking milk products. These offer                  products in small, affordable package sizes. Powdered and shelf stable milk make up 87.3%                 of drinking milk product retail sales mainly due to the limited availability and affordability of                 fresh milk and refrigeration in the country.                       III. Market Shares                        Filipino consumers shop almost daily on a needs basis at independent/traditional","grocers called sari-saris. These stores make up the largest distribution channel for milk                 products, at 56.5% of grocery retailers. This channel is popular in rural areas as they serve                 as the hub of many communities and offer products in small package sizes that are                 affordable, which is a major consideration for Filipino consumers.                       Middle class consumers tend to use convenience stores and small scale supermarkets,                 which represent 43.6% of grocery retail sales. These, as well as upscale supermarkets                 (Family Mart and Rustan's Supermarket Fresh), are often located in urban centers and                 shopping malls and are popular for their selection of imported brands and higher quality                 products.                       Online shopping is undeveloped in the Philippines due to slow internet speed, a lack of                 internet access in rural areas, poor transport infrastructure, and a general mistrust of digital                 payment methods. Ecommerce penetration is not expected to significantly alter Filipino                 shopping habits, where shopping is a very popular pastime and Filipinos tend to use malls to                 congregate (in air conditioning) at stores, restaurants and entertainment venues.","IV. Consumer Trends                      In modern times, powdered milk is usually made by spray drying nonfat skimmed                 milk, whole milk, buttermilk or whey. Powdered milk, also called dried milk, or milk powder, is                  a manufactured dairy product made by evaporating milk to dryness. One purpose of drying                 milk is to preserve it; milk powder has a far longer shelf life than liquid milk and does not                 need to be refrigerated, due to its low moisture content. Indeed the Philippines seems to be                 fertile ground for all Nestlé products and not just for Bearbrand powdered milk.                      Bearbrand powder milk here in the Philippines they offer variants of powdered milk like                  Bearbrand Powdered Choco, straw berry, mixed Choco and milk and bear brand Ready to                 drink with different pack size and weight. In 2014, a consumer research firm ranked Bear                 Brand milk as No. 6 among the top 50 \"most popular fast-moving consumer goods\" in the                 Philippines. Bearbrand has many competitors here in the Philippines like Alaska, Arla,                 Anchor. Birch Tree. Milk Magic and Nido.

Whereas, in LAMEA, the milk powder market continues to grow quickly                 due to changes in consumer work and lifestyles, which as a result has encouraged people in                 the region to start depending on packaged food item. Moreover, increase in consumption of                  infant formulas has added to the demand for milk powder in the region. Since packaging is                 one of the largest industries in the entire world, they were one of the first to see                 biodegradable products in general. Unfortunately, only a small section of the packaging                 market adheres to sustainable practices. In just a short decade, the future of packaging has                 begun to change more significantly. Before, eco-friendly and biodegradable packaging","wasn’t seen as something revolutionary or worth a second look, however, it is now inserting                 itself as an essential aspect of every business’ packaging solutions.","SITUATIONAL ANALYSIS                 A.

CONSUMER TRENDS","According to Moran (2019) Filipino diners where asked about their current                               favorite choice of food has been samgyeopsal, sometimes shortened to “samgyup.”                               Samgyeopsal continues to become on the top lists of local food trends in long term                               already.                                      The adoption of electric grills witnessed a surge on account of the rising                               preference of consumers for grilling meals at home. It is more feasible as it does not                               incur the need for checking the temperature, usage of charcoal, and dealing with                               smoke. Moreover, the advantage of convenience and indoor utility of these products                               have an upper stake in the market. Electric grills rely on electricity as a source of fuel                               for heating surface and grill plate which provides an added advantage of the                               restriction of charcoal and gas grill with respect to apartment barbecuing. Thus,                               indoor   usage    beyond     smoke     will  promote     product    demand.

The total amount of solar energy                               incident on Earth is vastly in excess of the world’s current and anticipated energy                               requirements. If suitably harnessed, this highly diffused source has the potential to                               satisfy all future energy needs. In the 21st century solar energy is expected to                               become increasingly attractive as a renewable energy source because of its                               inexhaustible supply and its nonpolluting character, in stark contrast to the finite                               fossil fuels coal, petroleum, and natural gas.

CONSUMER PROFILE                                Grilling is one of summer’s many great pleasures, playing an important role in                           countless backyard get-togethers, birthday parties, and family gatherings.

There isn’t much about the barbecue grill until the late 1940s, during this time,                           many backyards became filled with grills. However, these mass-produced                            appliances were commonly known for burning the meat and creating a large                           amount of ash. The concept was refined in 1952 by a welder named George                           Stephen. He cut metal to make dome-shaped grills, using the top half as a lid to                            seal in the flavor and help distribute heat more evenly. He then added vents so                           that the fire wouldn’t smother. This design is what many people think of when                            they think about barbecue grills today, as many modern models are based on this                           model.                                 The next evolution in the basic grill (Gas grill) came in the 1960s when there                           was a push to get people to buy more natural gas. Melton Lancaster and William                           G. Wepfer, from the Arkansas Louisiana Gas Company, created a new type of                            grill that ran on propane. This increased the price of grilling; however, these","appliances were often easier to use and thus they boomed in popularity, replacing                           some of the older models.

COMPANY BACKGROUND                            History of Grilling                                The beginning of grilling can be traced back to the 17th century when you                           look at the Arawak tribe of the Caribbean and South America. These people used                           sticks to create a flame over a fire and place the meat on it. They called this                            method of cooking Barbacoa. This idea was adopted by conquerors from Spain,                           who evolved it until the 18th century when people in southeastern America took                           up the idea. Pigs spent hours roasting over a fire, and various sauces and                            different types of wood were used to give different flavors to the meat.                               In 1897, Ellsworth B. A. Zwoyer was the first to patent a design for charcoal                            briquettes, although his thunder was somewhat stolen by the Kingsford company,                           who many associate with grilling. This company was created by Henry Ford, and                           he used wood scraps and sawdust that he got from the assembly lines of his cars                            to create the charcoal.
