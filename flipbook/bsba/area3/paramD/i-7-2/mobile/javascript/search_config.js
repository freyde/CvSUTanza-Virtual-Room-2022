Industry Analysis                                A.  Industry features                                   The  food  industry  is  very  large,  and  if  food  production,  manufacturing,                                   marketing, restaurants and institutions are combined, it is the largest industrial                                   enterprise.  An  appreciation  of the  size,  components,  interrelationships, and                                   responsiveness  to  change  of  the  food  industry  enlarges  food  scientists’                                    understanding of the environment in which they operate.                                  B.  Industry Boundaries                                   From  the  word  boundary  itself  which  means  a  border  or  a  limit,  industry                                   boundaries could be defined as the point at which industries ends or beyond                                   which it becomes something else. This means that industry boundaries are the                                   demarcations between two distinct industries, and so it encompasses both the                                    supply and demand trajectories.                                   Understanding  the  industries  and  its  sectors  and  monitoring  the                                   macroeconomic  environment  are  the  two  main  objectives  of  industry                                   boundaries whereby organizational strategies are at the core of the business                                   conduct.                                   C.  Industry Environment                                   Restaurants and other food-service providers are so widespread that half of all                                   adults have worked in food service in one way or another at some point in their                                   lives. The food service industry encompasses any establishment that serves","17                                    food  to  people  outside  their  home.  This  includes  restaurants,  carryout                                   operations, cafeterias, university dining halls, catering and vending companies,                                   hotels and inns, and rehab and retirement centers.                                      This industry is divided into two groups: Those that prepare and serve food and                                   those that produce and distribute food, equipment, and services needed by                                   food providers. The most common example of the first group is restaurants.                                   Restaurants employ front of the house people and back of the house people.                                   The  former  includes  bartenders,  wait  staff,  hosts,  and  busboys.  The  latter                                    includes chefs, cooks, managers, and dishwashers. Fast food restaurants limit                                   their staff to food preparation people, managers, and cashiers. The trend of                                   food trucks adds a mobile component to food service and requires just a few                                   people to drive the truck, cook the food, and serve it through a window.                                  D.  Industry Structure                                   Foodservice establishments are projected to capture 53 percent of consumers’                                    food  expenditures,  whereas  in  1980,  foodservice  captured  less  than  40                                   percent. The foodservice industry accounts for approximately 4 percent of the                                   Gross  Domestic  Product  and  about  11  million  jobs.  It  has  been  rapidly                                   changing  due  to  economic  factors,  technological  advances,  and  labor                                   matters.1 This overview covers many of the issues and trends affecting the                                    different segments of the foodservice supply chain including the foodservice                                   operators,  distributors  and  food  manufacturers.  Changing  customer                                   demographics are a driving force in the evolution of the foodservice industry.                                   As the baby boomers reach middle age, they do not seem to have time to cook                                   and their children and grandchildren do not seem to have the interest, or talent.","18                                   E.  Industry attractiveness                                   Products  will  continue  to  roll  out  to  meet  consumers’  health  and  wellness                                   desires, and plant-based meats will keep making a dent in the market.                                    Food and beverage service is the essential link between the customers and                                   the menu,  beverages  and  other  services  on  offer  in  an  establishment. The                                   server  is  the  main  point  of  contact  between  the  customers  and  the                                   establishment  and  plays  an  important  role  in  a  profession  with  increasing                                   national and international status.

Industry Performance                                   A performance appraisal for customer service expectations is more than simply                                   evaluating employees on whether they greet customers with a smile or whether                                   managers effectively resolve conflicts with suppliers who fail to provide high-                                   quality food products for use in their restaurants. Performance appraisals for                                   customer service in the F\&B world delve deeper into duties such as how to                                    ensure each restaurant patron has an enjoyable dining experience or the ability                                   for  a  bartender  to  take  off  his  mixologist  hat  and  make  the  transition  to                                   psychologist and confidante for a customer who stops in to have a cocktail after                                   a stressful day in the office. Service standards also include the techniques for                                   recommending selections to customers based on questions about customers’                                    preferences, how to approach customers throughout their meal and the timing                                   that wait staff should use when deciding whether to recommend the dessert                                   selections or simply bring the bill.","19                                 G.

Economic Background                                The  economy  of  Canada  is  a  highly  developed  mixed  economy.  It  is  the  9th                         largest  GDP  by  nominal  and  15th  largest  GDP  by  PPP  in  the  world.  As  with  other                         developed nations, the country's economy is dominated by the service industry which                         employs  about  three  quarters  of  Canadians.  Canada  has  the  third  highest  total                          estimated  value  of  natural  resources,  valued  at  USD  $31  trillion  in  2019.  It  has  the                         world's  third  largest  proven  petroleum  reserves  and  is  the  fourth  largest  exporter  of                         petroleum. It is also the fourth largest exporter of natural gas. Canada is considered an                         \"energy superpower\" due to its abundant natural resources and a small population of 37                         million inhabitants relative to its land area.                                According to the Corruption Perceptions Index, Canada is perceived as one of                          the least corrupt countries in the world, and is one of the world's top ten trading nations,                         with a highly globalized economy. Canada historically ranks above the U.S. and most                         western  European  nations  on  The  Heritage  Foundation's  index  of  economic  freedom,                         and  experiencing  a  relatively  low  level  of  income  disparity.  The  country's  average                         household  disposable  income  per  capita  is  \"well  above\"  the  OECD  average.  The                         Toronto  Stock  Exchange  is  the  eighth-largest  stock  exchange  in  the  world  by  market                          capitalization, listing over 1,500 companies with a combined market capitalization of over                         US$3 trillion.                                In 2018, Canadian trade in goods and services reached CA$1.5 trillion. Canada's                         exports totalled over CA$585 billion, while its imported goods were worth over CA$607                         billion, of which approximately CA$391 billion originated from the United States, CA$216                         billion from non-U.S. sources. In 2018, Canada had a trade deficit in goods of CA$22                         billion and a trade deficit in services of CA$25 billion.","5                                  Canada is unusual among developed countries in the importance of the primary                         sector,  with the  logging  and  energy  industries  being  two  of  Canada's most  important.                         Canada  also  has  a  sizable  manufacturing  sector,  based  in  Central  Canada,  with  the                         automobile  industry  and  aircraft  industry  being  especially  important.  With  the  world's                          longest coastline, Canada has the 8th largest commercial fishing and seafood industry in                         the world. Canada is one of the global leaders of the entertainment software industry. It                         is a member of the APEC, G7, G20, OECD and WTO, and was formerly a member of                         NAFTA until the USMCA came into force in 2020. In Canada, the USMCA is officially                         known as the Canada–United States–Mexico Agreement (CUSMA) in English and the                          Accord Canada–États-Unis–Mexique (ACEUM) in French.                         II. PESTL Analysis                                A.     Political                                Canada is a founding member of the United Nations and is a powerful country. It                         maintains good relations with the most powerful country in the world, the USA. It also                         maintains good relations with the United Kingdom, France and many other countries in                         the world. Ottawa is the capital of Canada.                                 Canada is a democratic country with a parliamentary system in place. It also has                         a constitutional monarchy. Queen Elizabeth II is the head of state, while the Governor                         General is her representative who usually carries out most of the royal duties in Canada.                         The Prime Minister is the head of the government and holds the executive power.                         Canada enjoys a very good political stability. It is in fact one of the safest countries in the                          world. With a low crime rate and trustworthy policing services, Canada positions itself a                         very good place for business and tourism. It is worth mentioning that Canada’s focus on                         international peacekeeping has earned it a very good global image.","6                                  B.     Economic and Currency                                Canada is one of the 10 largest economies in the world. It has membership in the                         Organisation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and  Development  (OECD),  the  World  Trade                         Organization (WTO), the G20 and the Commonwealth of Nations. Canada also has free                          trade  agreements  with  a  number  of  countries.  For  example,  it  signed  a  free  trade                         agreement called Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) with the EU                         in September 2017. This agreement aims to make it easier to export goods and services                         to benefit people and business both in Canada and the EU. Canada along with Mexico                         and  the  United  States  signed  the  North  American  Free  Trade  Agreement  (NAFTA)  in                          1994 to create a trilateral trade bloc.                                Canada has a highly developed mixed economy. Both the government and the                         people of Canada make economic choices for the country. Some industries are publicly                         owned, while some others are privately owned. For example, Canada has more than 40                         state-owned  enterprises  (SOEs)  at  the  federal  level.  Likewise,  it  has  more  than  100                         SOEs at the provincial level that immensely contribute to a variety of sectors including,                         finance; power, electricity, utilities, and transportation (ITA, 2021). The estimated worth                          of GDP in Canada for the year 2020 was $1590.00 Billion (Trading Economics, 2021).                         With  a  strong  and  dynamic  economy,  diverse  and  entrepreneurial  people,  world-class                         infrastructure,  and  one  of  the  best  banking  systems  in  the  world,  Canada  draws  the                         attention of investors and businesses around the world. However, it is worth mentioning                         that the impact of economic lockdown in 2020 was deeper than expected. Some of the                          top  exports  of  Canada  are  motor  vehicles  and  parts,  gold,  telecommunications                         equipment,  industrial  machinery  and  crude  petroleum.  Canada’s top  imports  are  cars,                         vehicle parts, computers, and delivery trucks. The top trading partners of Canada are the                         US, Mexico, China, Japan, Germany, and the UK.","7                           The Canadian Dollar (CAD) is the official currency of Canada. The symbol used for the                         Canadian Dollar is $, or C$ to distinguish it from other dollar currencies. The Canadian                         Dollar is subdivided into 100 cents.                                C.     Social and Cultural Factors                                 Canadians’  sense  of  belonging  to  their  community  and  their  country,  their                         participation  in  civic,  community  and  volunteer  activities,  the  social  and  family                         relationships they have with one another, and the presence of a social safety net equally                         available  to  all  citizens  are  important  components  associated  with  our  well-being  as                         citizens. About 85% of Canadians reported their sense of belonging to Canada as being                          ‘very strong’ or ‘somewhat strong’.                                Overall, 53% of Canadians said that in general people can be trusted, whereas                         43% said that one cannot be too careful in dealing with other people. Quebeckers were                         less  inclined  to  trust  people  but  more  likely  to  express  confidence  in  institutions.  A                         research on seniors, widowers are 70% more likely to die than men who are married or                         living with a partner. The protective effects of marriage for men—an indicator of social                         support and social integration—with respect to mortality has been widely observed. The                          culture of Canada embodies the artistic, culinary, literary, humour, musical, political and                         social elements that are representative of Canada and Canadians. Throughout Canada's                         history, its culture has been influenced by European culture and traditions, mostly by the                         British and French, and by its own indigenous cultures.                                D.     Technological Factors and Infrastructure                                 Like  all  other  major  economies,  technology  plays  a  big  role  in  the  Canadian                         economy.  In  fact,  technology  is  one  of  the  fastest  growing  sectors  in  the  country.                         Canadians make use of technology for many purposes, most notably education, careers,                         and leisure. The technology sector provides people with high-paying jobs as well.","8                           Both public and private investments in Canada’s technology industry are growing swiftly.                         In addition, political, economic and social stability have made the country a fertile ground                         for entrepreneurship advancement. In fact, many international IT professionals and firms                         see Canada as one of the best countries in the world to advance their careers and grow                          their  businesses.  Across  Canada,  technology  is  changing  the  landscape  of  many                         traditional industries and is offering both people and companies a lot of opportunities.                         Canada  has  one  of  the  best-developed  infrastructures  in  the  world.  It  meets  the                         requirements for high-tech business and international trade.                                E.     Legal and Regulatory                                 Legal  environment  is  the  last  element  to  discuss  in  the  PESTEL  analysis  of                         Canada. A number of relevant issues should be discussed here. For example, certain                         rights  of  employees  are  protected  by  law  in  Canada.  There  are  some  minimum                         standards  employers  must  abide  by  concerning  employees’  hours  of  work,  minimum                         wages, sick days, vacation, dismissal, and many more. The Canadian Human Rights Act                         (CHRA)  prohibits  discrimination  on  the  basis  of  gender,  race,  ethnicity,  age  and  a                         number  of  other  grounds.  There  are  many  methods  to  do  business  in  Canada.  For                          instance,  corporations,  joint  ventures,  general  or  limited  partnerships,  trusts,  sole                         proprietorships, co-operatives, and Branch plant operations are the most common ones.                         For  international  businesses,  corporation  is  the  most  popular  method  of  entry  into                         Canada (Mercier \& Woodman, 2019).                         The Government of Canada is committed to protecting and advancing the public interest                          in  health,  safety  and  security,  the  quality  of  the  environment,  and  the  social  and                         economic  well-being  of  Canadians  through  an  effective,  efficient,  and  accountable                         regulatory system. Canada’s regulatory system is internationally recognized as among                         the best in the world.","9                           III. Economic Factors                                A.     Size of Market                                The Toronto Stock Exchange is the eighth-largest stock exchange in the world by                         market capitalization, listing over 1,500 companies with a combined market capitalization                          of over US$3 trillion. In 2018, Canadian trade in goods and services reached CA$1.5                         trillion.                                B.     National Income                                Fishing is a global industry, and of key importance to Canada. Bringing $6 billion                         into the Canadian economy, fish and seafood were Canada's second largest single food                          export in 2015.                                B.     Purchasing Power                                In 2019, the purchasing power of a Canadian dollar was US$0.83, down 0.4%                         from  2018.  The  estimate  indicates  that  the  equivalent  goods  and  services  bought  by                         CAN$100 in Canada would require US$83 to purchase in the United States. The annual                         exchange rate of a Canadian dollar fell from US$0.77 in 2018 to US$0.75 in 2019.                                C.     Availability of Credit                                 To meet its mandate, the Bank carefully monitors changes in credit conditions,                         the  money  supply,  financial  system  liquidity,  and  other  credit-market  indicators.  This                         information  reflects  changes  in  the  economy,  the  influence  of  monetary  policy,  and                         financial market conditions.                                If  you  have  a  Canadian  business  with  a  viable  commercial  model,  you  could                          receive a financial aid from the federal government to weather the crisis.                         The Business credit availability program (BCAP) includes; Canada emergency business                         account  (CEBA);  Joint  loan  program  from    BDC;  Business  credit  availability  program                         (BCAP)  Guarantee;  Mid-market  financing  program.  The  BCAP  will  promote  access  to                         financing for businesses in every sector and region.","10                                  IV. Type of Economy                                The  economy  of  Canada  is  a  highly  developed  mixed  economy.  It  is  the  9th                         largest  GDP  by  nominal  and  15th  largest  GDP  by  PPP  in  the  world.  As  with  other                         developed nations, the country's economy is dominated by the service industry which                          employs about three quarters of Canadians.                                Canada's economy expanded at a 6.5 per cent pace in the first three months of                         2021, as the service sector is showing signs of coming out of the COVID-19 doldrums                         even  as  large  parts  of  goods-producing  industries  are  still  lagging.  Statistics  Canada                         reported  Friday  that  Canada's  gross  domestic  product  expanded  by  0.4  per  cent  in                          February alone. That came on the heels of a larger 0.7 per cent spike in January. But                         coupled with preliminary data for March showing 0.9 per cent growth, that puts Canada                         on track for healthy growth for the quarter as a whole.","11                                                       ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT                          I. Cultural Background                                A.     National Culture                                The culture of Canada embodies the artistic, culinary, literary, humour, musical,                         political  and  social  elements  that  are  representative  of  Canada  and  Canadians.                         Throughout Canada's history, its culture has been influenced by European culture and                          traditions, mostly by the British and French, and by its own indigenous cultures. Over                         time,  elements  of  the  cultures  of  Canada's  immigrant  populations  have  become                         incorporated  to  form  a  Canadian  cultural  mosaic.  Certain  segments  of  Canada’s                         population  have,  to  varying  extents,  also  been  influenced  by  American  culture  due  to                         shared  language  (in  English-speaking  Canada),  significant  media  penetration  and                         geographic proximity.                                 a.     Identity                                Canadian  identity  refers  to  the  unique  culture,  characteristics  and  condition  of                         being  Canadian,  as  well  as  the  many  symbols  and  expressions  that  set  Canada  and                         Canadians apart from other peoples and cultures of the world.                         Canadians  have  never  reached  a  consensus  on  a  single,  unified  conception  of  the                         country. Most notions of Canadian identity have shifted between the ideas of unity and                          plurality. They have emphasized either a vision of “one” Canada or a nation of “many”                         Canada’s. A more recent view of Canadian identity sees it as marked by a combination                         of both unity and plurality. The pluralist approach sees compromise as the best response                         to the tensions national, regional, ethnic, religious and political — that make up Canada.                                b.     Material Life                                People transfer their norms and values from one generation to another through                         their culture. Moreover, methods through which people carry out their lives are different","12                        in  different  cultural  settings.  Communities  use  different  tools  to  accomplish  their  daily                         activities. In short, people are defined by specific issues that they do in their day-to-day                         activities.                                c.     Language                                 The official languages spoken in Canada are English and French, although there                         are many more English speakers than French.                         There are more than 60 Aboriginal languages spoken across the country ranging from                         Algonquin Cree to Inuit.                         Records  from  2011  estimate  the  languages  of  Canada  as  follows:  English  (official)                          58.7%, French (official) 22%, Punjabi 1.4%, Italian 1.3%, Spanish 1.3%, German 1.3%,                         Cantonese 1.2%, Tagalog 1.2%, Arabic 1.1%, other 10.5%                                d.     Social Interactions                                Face-to-face interaction of even the simplest sort is a far more socially intricate                         operation  than  we  generally  recognize.  It  is  rife  with  unacknowledged  rituals,  tacit                         understandings, covert symbolic exchanges, impression management techniques, and                         calculated strategic maneuverings.                                 e.     Aesthetics                                The field of aesthetics focuses on the beauty industry and outward appearance,                         including skin care, makeup, facials, waxing, and nail care. Practitioners are referred to                         as aestheticians, and often work in salon and spa settings. We are a voluntary member                         of Skills Canada.

Education                                The education system in Canada encompasses both publicly-funded and private                          schools,  including:  community  colleges/  technical  institutes,  career  colleges,  language                         schools, secondary schools,  summer camps, universities and university colleges.                         Education  is  a  provincial  responsibility  under  the  Canadian  constitution,  which  means                         there  are  significant  differences  between  the  education  systems  of  the  different                         provinces.  However,  education  is  important  to  Canadians,  and  standards  across  the                         country are uniformly high. In general, Canadian children attend kindergarten for one or                         two years at the age of four or five on a voluntary basis. All children begin Grade One at                          about  six  years  of  age.  The  school  year  normally  runs  from  September  through  the                         following  June  but  in  some  instances,  January  intake  dates  are  possible.  Secondary                         schools go up to Grades 11 or 12, depending on the province. From there, students may                         attend university, college or Cégep studies. Cégep is a French acronym for College of                         General  and  Vocational  Education,  and  is  two  years  of  general  or  three  years  of                          technical education between high school and university. The province of Québec has the                         Cégep system.                                h.     Value Systems                                Canadians are proud of Canada and its reputation around the world. Canadians                         value equality, respect, safety, peace, nature - and Canadian people love their hockey!.","14                           Equality:                         In law, women and men are equal in Canada. Canada was one of the first countries in                         the  world  to  legalize  same-sex  marriage.  Canadian  law  protects  the  rights  of  the                          LGBTQ+  community.  The  Charter  of  Rights  and  Freedoms  is  a  key  piece  of  the                         Canadian  legal  system. Canadians  see the  Charter  as  an  important  part  of  Canadian                         values.                         Respect for different cultures:                         Indigenous peoples were the first to welcome newcomers to what we now call Canada.                          Today, many Canadians (about 1 in 5) were born in other parts of the world. Many more                         have  parents  and  grandparents  who  were  not  born  in  Canada.  People  bring  their                         cultures and traditions to Canada with them. Together we hope to build communities that                         celebrate our differences as well as what we have in common.                         Safety and peace:                         Canada is a safe country with very low crime rates. Canadians are proud of Canada's                         many  roles  with  the  United  Nations,  international  aid  agencies  and  with  international                          peacekeeping missions around the world.                         Nature:                         Canada is the second largest country in the world. Many of the world's greatest natural                         wonders are in Canada (the Great Lakes, Niagara Falls, the Bay of Fundy, the Rocky                         Mountains, and the Arctic in the far north). Respect for the environment is an important                          part of what Canadians value.                         Being polite:                         Canadians are polite. We wait in lines. We say sorry if you bump into us. We hold doors                         open for you. We like that we are polite.","15                          Hockey:                         Hockey may not be the official sport of Canada but it is the sport that most Canadians                         feel most passionate about. Hockey is played on backyard ice rinks, in local community                          centres and in stadiums that seat thousands. Hockey is played by any and all genders                         from the ages of 3-4 to seniors. Hockey is an important part of local communities.                                B.     Business Culture                                Business  culture  in  Canada  is  a  blend  of  American,  British,  and  French                         tendencies;  that  is,  practices  vary  depending  on  the  region.  Most  Canadians  identify                          themselves very strongly with their province. Respect for opinions, equality, diversity and                         justice are, however, the values governing the business environment.                         Canadian  businesses  had  traditionally  been  hierarchical,  but  flattened  hierarchy  are                         gaining ground. Thus, research into a company's structure is required before engaging in                         negotiations.  The  managers  are  going  to  be  in  charge  of  making  the  final  decision.                         However,  they  seldom  make  the  decision  without  consulting  the  opinions  of  the                         subordinates.                          Developing a personal relationship to strengthen the business relationship is not usually                         necessary. As a rule, privacy is separated from professional life.                                C.     Organizational Culture                                Culture  is  the  combined  attitudes,  values,  beliefs  and  behaviours  of  the                         organization,  or  what  is  universally  understood  in  order  for  members  to  “fit  in”.  But  if                          leaders motivate members to strive for excellence, encourage them to work together to                         solve problems, solicit their ideas to make improvements, and challenge them  to take                         ownership  and  creatively  solve  problems;  people  will  want  to  embrace  change  and                         willingly accept new challenges.","16                          II.

Political and Legal Background                                 A.     Home Country Vs. Host Country (relationship)                                The  Philippines  and  Canada  are  quite  different.  Canada  has  education                         expenditures of 5.4% of GDP while the Philippines uses 2.7%. This is likely because,                         being a developing country, the Philippines spends more money on exports and tourism.                         Canadian citizens also have a higher school life expectancy.                                 Diplomatic  relations  between  Canada  and  the  Philippines  were  established  in                         1949  when  Canada  established  a  trade  mission  in  Manila.  The  Philippines  first                         established its diplomatic presence in Canada when it opened a consulate in Vancouver                         in May 1956. The Philippine embassy in Ottawa was later opened on 1 March 1971. The                         Canadian trade mission was formally upgraded into an embassy in 1972.                                B.     Structure of Government                                Canada is a parliamentary democracy: its system of government holds that the                          law  is  the  supreme  authority.  The  Constitution  Act,  1867,  which  forms  the  basis  of                         Canada’s written constitution, provides that there shall be one Parliament for Canada,                         consisting  of  three  distinct  elements:  the  Crown,  the  Senate  and  the  House  of                         Commons. However, as a federal state, responsibility for lawmaking in Canada is shared                         among one federal, ten provincial and three territorial governments.                          The power to enact laws is vested in a legislature composed of individuals selected to                         represent the Canadian people. Hence, it is a “representative” system of government.                         The federal legislature is bicameral: it has two deliberative “houses” or “chambers” an                         upper house, the Senate, and a lower house, the House of Commons. The Senate is                         composed  of  individuals  appointed  by  the  Governor  General  to  represent  Canada’s","provinces and territories. Members of the House of Commons are elected by Canadians                                                                                                           18                        who are eligible to vote. The successful candidates are those who receive the highest                         number  of  votes  cast  among  the  candidates  in  their  electoral  district  in  this  single-                         member, simple-plurality system.                                 Canada is also a constitutional monarchy, in that its executive authority is vested                         formally in the Queen through the Constitution.  Every act of government is carried out in                         the name of the Crown, but the authority for those acts flows from the Canadian people.                         The  executive  function  belongs  to  the  Governor  in  Council,  which  is,  practically                         speaking, the Governor General acting with, and on the advice of, the Prime Minister                          and the Cabinet.                         Political  parties  play  a  critical  role  in  the  Canadian  parliamentary  system.  Parties  are                         organizations, bound together by a common ideology, or other ties, which seek political                         power in order to implement their policies. In a democratic system, the competition for                         power takes place in the context of an election.                                C.     Government Policies and Regulations                                Canada is a parliamentary democracy based on the British form of government.                          There are three levels of government in Canada: federal, provincial, and municipal. Each                         level  of  government  sets  certain  types  of  laws  and  is  responsible  for  certain  types  of                         issues.                         Regulations are the rules used to carry out the intent of statutes (Acts) enacted by the                         Parliament of Canada. They are instruments of legislative power and have the force of                          law.                                Regulations  contain  more  specific  guidelines  than  Acts.  These  can  include                         definitions,  licensing  requirements,  performance specifications,  exemptions, forms  and                         other  details.  Most  of  the  Acts  administered  by  Citizenship  and  Immigration  Canada                         have their own accompanying Regulations.","19                          II. Marketing Laws                                A.     Promotions                                The  Competition  Act  (the  Act)  is  the  primary  federal  statute  in  Canada  that                          prohibits  false  or  misleading  advertising  or  deceptive  marketing  practices.  The  Act                         prohibits making representations to the public that are false or misleading in a material                         respect. Such representations are reviewable under civil provisions and prohibited under                         criminal  provisions  of  the  Act.  The  principles  of  ensuring  that  advertisements  are  not                         misleading  to  consumers  are  similar  in  Canada  and  the  United  States  as  are  the                          guidelines  for  endorsements  by  influencers  or  celebrities.  However,  there  are  some                         unique issues in Canada including restrictions in Quebec with respect to advertising to                         children and restrictions on advertising certain other products such as pharmaceuticals,                         cannabis, tobacco and alcohol. A campaign that is compliant in the United States may                         not necessarily be so in Canada. Your advertising agency and legal counsel should work                         together to review marketing and advertising materials for compliance.                                B.     Product Development                                 We  proposed  to  develop  the  packaging  and  the  layout.  We  will  really  try  to                         explore what good packaging would really fit in this products that would not smell. Also,                         we will improve the two types of dried  danggit fish: the marinated one and the salted                         variety. The salted variety is the cheaper variety and taste more like the typical “daing na                         isda”. Whereas, the marinated danggit dried fish variety is one of the popular types of                          fried  fish  here  in  the  Philippines.  Danggi'lecious  is  committed  to  provide  its  customer                         excellent service by meeting specific customer needs by providing amazing dried fish at                         competitive prices.","20                                 C.     Labelling                                Labels need to be in both English and French. Food labels must include specific                         nutritional information. And a consumer product might need to indicate whether it meets                          Canadian energy-efficiency requirements.                                Canadian labelling and packaging requirements are different in several respects                         from those in the United States. The most significant difference is the requirement for                         bilingual labelling throughout Canada. In addition the system of measurement is different                         and  will  require  changes  to  packages  to  reflect  the  metric  system.  There  are  also                          numerous  specific  requirements  for  particular  classes  of  products.  All  labels  must                         include  bilingual  ingredient  lists  and  in  some  cases  instructions  must  also  be  in  both                         languages  and  comply  with  legislation  respecting  product  claims.  Companies  often                         engage  consults  to  assist  in  preparing  new  packaging  and  labels,  however  the                         consultant  should  also  liaise  with  legal counsel to  ensure the  packaging  and  labelling                         legal requirements are met.                                D.     Pricing                                 The  Competition  Act  contains  five  provisions  dealing  specifically  with  price                         representations:  four  under  the  civil  regime  (false  or  misleading  ordinary  selling  price                         representations and bait and switch selling, sale above advertised price) and one under                         the  criminal  regime  (double  ticketing).  Price  representations  may  also  be  addressed                         under the general provisions against false or misleading representations.                                 E.     Channels of Distribution                                As one of the world’s heaviest users of the Internet, Canadians have embraced                         electronic  commerce  amid  a  major  disruption  in  retail  channels.  Canadian  consumers                         increasingly  rely  upon  the  Internet  to  place  orders.  For  the  past  decade,  Internet                         consumer  sales  have  risen  at  a  far  higher  rate  than  traditional  retail  sales.  Most","21                        Canadian retail firms have adopted wireless technologies and internet-based systems to                         improve business-to-business and business-to-consumer relations. Manufacturing firms                         and  government  organizations  are  also  increasingly  likely  to  use  the  Internet  for                         purchases, especially for small routine orders.                          III. Impact of Political and Legal Factors to Marketing Mix                                A.     Product                                Dried fish is a salted dried fish and coined by many as a “poor man’s food”, but                         truth is lots of  people, whether local or foreigner, also crave for such a delicacy. We aim                         to establish a dried danggit fish in Toronto, Canada.

B.     Price                                We will offer the most affordable dried danggit fish in Toronto Canada. With the                         growing number of Filipinos that move to Canada each year, Filipinos are now becoming                         the fastest- growing cultural group in their country. As a result, the Philippine culture is                         starting to flourish  in  some  Canadian  provinces  and  cities that  will  help  us  to  sell  our                          product to our fellow Filipino citizen over there.                                C.     Place                                The province of Quebec has requirements with respect to the use of the French                         language when marketing and selling to consumers in Quebec. Making a decision early                         in your planning process as to whether you plan to sell products in Quebec will inform                          many  other  steps  you  take  along  the  way,  such  as  building  your  website,  terms  and                         conditions  for  e-commerce,  packaging,  signage  on  store  fronts,  contests  and                         trademarks.","22                                 D.     Promotion                                In Quebec the translation of some materials into French may be mandatory and                         bilingual  labelling  requirements  are  Canada  wide.  However,  from  a  marketing                          perspective you may also consider translating promotional materials to French to reach                         a wider audience in other provinces such as Ontario, and New Brunswick where French                         is  widely  spoken  or  to  other  languages  to  market  to  the  very  diverse  Canadian                         population.","23                                               INTERNATIONAL MARKETING PLANNING                         I.

Segmentation Strategies                                Dang’gilicious  segmentation,  targeting  and  positioning  is  one  of  the  integral                         components  of  its  marketing  strategy.

Our marketing budget for the year is PHP 3 209 486.57, which will be spread                         over  the  following  marketing  activities;  distribution  of  posters  and  flyers  by  sales                         representatives,  tv  commercials,  websites  and  social  media  ads.  We've  developed  a                         marketing plan that will help us to quickly reach key stakeholders in the snack industry                          and  become  the  main  provider  of  Filipino  delicacies  to  this  market.  We  will  use  our                         experience in selling to the snack industry to showcase the benefits of our product.","2                                                            INTRODUCTION                              With increasing globalization and related advantages, business organizations are urged                          to go international. This is all due to the fact that Globalization creates opportunities for                         many countries to experience economic growth since it enables economy to increase the                         goods and services they produce over time. This international marketing plan correlate                         with the overall goal of the business organization which is to introduce Filipino delicacies                         all over the world. It aims to analyze the possibility of survival in Saudi Arabian market.                         The situation analysis will help us learn whether it is feasible for Tahopical to enter the                         said market or not. Thus, this marketing plan will help us foresee the outcome of Tahopical                          entering the Saudi Arabian market.                          This marketing plan is proposed by Mr. Estera, Ms. Gianan, Ms. Regulacion, Ms. Delos                          Reyes, and Mr. Quintana, Third year business management students major in marketing                         of  Cavite  State  University-  Tanza  Campus.  The  Business  name  “Tahopical”  is  a                         portmanteau  word  or  blended  word  for  Taho  and  Tropical.  As  the  name  suggest,  the                         business have Taho as the main product. Taho is a Filipino sweet treat consisting of silken                         tofu, simple syrup, and tapioca pearls. It is usually served warm or at room temperature.                         However, you can also enjoy the tofu chilled for a cooling treat. Tropical countries such as                         Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and many other neighboring Asian countries have their own                          version of this sweet tofu snack. Taho is usually eaten as a light breakfast or as a sweet                         afternoon snack. It is enjoyed in the Philippines year-round. Taho is served in tiny snack                         sized portions. It’s usually served in a small 5 to 8 oz cups. Silken tofu is rather low in fat                         with a small amount of protein. However, Taho is technically a dessert because it’s full of                         sugar. Sugar from the simple syrup and the sugars from the tapioca balls (Cabrera, 2020).","3                          According to Mapa (2020), Saudi Arabia continued to be the most preferred destination of                         OFWs. One out of five (22.4%) OFWs worked in the country during the period April to                         September 2019. Since Tahopical offers an original Filipino dessert, a country with a large                         Filipino market is a perfect place to establish such start up. This ensures the survival of                          the business despite the change in the competitive environment. Furthermore, Soymilk \&                         soy drinks category is expected to register fastest value growth at a CGAR of 6.3% during                         2018-2023 in Saudi Arabia (India’s Dairy and Soy Food Sector Poised to Grow at 8.5%                         CAGR through 2023, Says GlobalData, 2019).                           The company’s goal is to introduce and bring original Filipino delicacies around the world.                         With that being said, Tahopical will introduce flavored Taho variants such as the classic,                         ube,  strawberry,  melon,  pandan,  chocolate,  etc.  and this  will  provide the  company  on                         having competitive advantage over their competitors. The consumers can also decide the                         percentage of syrup to be added as well as the sago to cater those buyers with health-                          related  concerns  and  their  varied  preferences. And  to  fully  bring the  Filipino  vibe,  the                         interior design of the shop will be based on a Nipa hut with servers wearing our traditional                         clothing. But to abide with the custom in Saudi Arabia, additional clothing will be required                         to avoid showing too much skin.                                                          ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT                           I. Economic Background                           Fueled by enormous revenues from oil exports, the economy boomed during the 1970s                         and ’80s. Unlike most developing countries, Saudi Arabia had an abundance of capital,                         and vast development projects sprung up that turned the once underdeveloped country","4                          into  a  modern  state.  During  that  time,  unemployment  was  all  but  nonexistent—large                         numbers of foreign workers were imported to do the most menial and the most highly                         technical tasks—and per capita income and gross domestic product (GDP) per capita                         were among the highest in the non-Western world (“Economy of Saudi Arabia,” (n.d.)                           In fact, according to Wikipedia contributors (2020), Saudi Arabia is currently the largest                         hirer  of Overseas  Filipino  Workers (OFWs), and  has  the  largest  Filipino  population  in                          the Middle East. Filipinos make up the fourth-largest group of foreigners in Saudi Arabia,                         and  are  the  second-largest  source  of remittances to  the  Philippines.  Filipinos  in  Saudi                         Arabia are either migrants or descendants of the Philippines living in Saudi Arabia.                          Agriculture accounts for 2.2% of the GDP and employs 2.3% of the active population.                          Agricultural productivity remains limited compared with public investment that funds the                         sector. Because of geographical and climatic constraints (droughts), Saudi Arabia imports                         most of its agricultural and food product requirements. Water scarcity is a serious regional                         problem that the country is likely to face in the coming years, as growing cultivation of                         wheat presents the threat of water depletion.                           The industrial sector represents 47.4% of the GDP and employs 24.8% of the workforce.                         It is dominated by non-manufacturing activities (oil drilling). The country has the largest oil                         reserves in the world and is also the largest producer and exporter of oil in the world. Oil                         accounts for nearly 80% of exports and 70% of government revenues (and more than 40%                          of GDP). The share of non-oil industrial sector has been increasing along with economic                         diversification efforts of the Saudi authorities.                           Lastly, services represent 50.4% of the GDP and employ 72.9% of the active population.                         This  sector  is  mainly  dominated  by  tourism,  ﬁnancial  and  banking  services  and  the                         insurance sector. Tourism generates very high revenues (almost 4 million tourists per","5                          year), due in particular to the Hajj, the pilgrimage to Mecca that takes place in the last                         month of the Islamic year, that all Muslims are expected to make at least once during their                         lifetime. The country introduced a new upon-arrival tourism visa to nationals of nearly 50                         countries in an attempt to increase tourism revenues (The Economic Context of Saudi                          Arabia, 2021).                          II. PESTL Analysis                           A.  Political                           Participation in the political process is limited to a relatively small portion of the population.                         There are no elections for national bodies, and political parties are outlawed. Women’s                         participation in politics is  traditionally limited, although women were allowed to run for                         seats on municipal councils beginning in 2015. Power rests largely in the hands of the                         royal family, which governs through a process that—despite the political and economic                          changes since the late 20th century—differs little from the traditional system of tribal rule.                         Tribal identity remains strong and is still an important pillar of social control. Despite the                         existence of a modern state bureaucracy, political influence is frequently determined by                         tribal affiliation. Tribal sheikhs, therefore, maintain a high degree of authority within the                         tribe and a considerable degree of influence over local and national events.                           B.  Economic and Currency                           Saudi Arabia is the largest economy in the Middle East and the richest Arab country in the                         region. The policy of large-scale public works undertaken by the authorities, as well as                         foreign direct investment and the soundness of the banking and ﬁnancial system, have                         enabled the country to become the number one regional economy and one of the largest                         in the world. However, the economy of Saudi Arabia is almost entirely based on oil, with","6                          GDP growth being closely linked to real oil growth. Extended OPEC production cuts and                         declining oil prices in 2020 pulled the Saudi economy into recession, with GDP contracting                         by  an  estimated  5.4%.  According  to  the  IMF's  October  2020  forecast,  the  country  is                         expected  to  grow  by  3.1%  in  2021,  with  the  expansion  of  hydrocarbon  activity  and                          resumption  of  capital  projects.  In  its  most  recent  January  2021  update  of  the  World                         Economic Outlook, the IMF has revised its GDP growth projections for Saudi Arabia to                         2.6%  in  2021  and  4%  in  2022  (representing  a  difference  from  October  2020  WEO                         projections of –0,5% and +0,6%, respectively).                           The  Saudi  Arabian  Monetary  Agency  (SAMA)  regulates  the  kingdom's  money  supply.                         Since  June  1986,  the  Saudi  riyal  had  been  informally  pegged  to  the  U.S.  dollar  at                         SR3.745:US$1. The fixed rate cuts down on revenue volatility, being that a majority of                         Saudi oil exports are sold to America and denominated in U.S. dollars. Keeping the riyal                         consistent in its relation to the dollar also helps keep the currency stable, and this, in turn,                          makes Saudi Arabia a more attractive market for international investment capital. At the                         same time, the pegged rate provides a stable exchange rate with other GCC countries                         whose currencies are also generally pegged to the dollar.                           C.  Social and Cultural Factors                          Historically,  Saudi  Arabia  has  long-emphasized  the  importance  of  the  arts  to  social                         development  and  culture.  With  the  release  of  the  national  strategy  plan,  the  Saudi                          leadership has pinpointed avenues by which culture and entertainment will contribute to                         long-term economic growth and bring about wider civil benefits. Saudi Vision recognizes                         the rich cultural and social heritage that distinguishes the Kingdom as a nation rooted in                         its identity as the heart of the Arab and Islamic worlds. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is                         observed  as  the  leader  of  the  Muslim  world,  as  it  is  the  home  town  of  Mecca.  The","7                          government  is  committed  to  supporting  the  economic  growth  and  to  be  part  of  the                         developed nations, which is very challenging to achieve since fundamentalist Muslims turn                         down the idea of globalization which could be seen as a political risk on the jurisdiction.                         While  on  the  other  hand,  this  political  situation  has  affected  the  restaurant  business                          positively because the restaurant industry has not been affected and still remains as a                         form of a social gathering among people.                           D.  Technological Factors and Infrastructure                          With over 27 million consumers and a sizable number of global enterprises, Saudi Arabia                          is the largest Information and Communications Technology (ICT) market in the Middle                         East.    The  Saudi  Arabian  telecommunications  and  information  technology  industries                         represent more than 55 percent and 51 percent, respectively, of the total Middle East                         market. The ICT strategy of the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology                         2019-23 is targeting a goal of 50 percent growth of the IT sector and raising the Saudi IT                         workforce to 50 percent by 2023. It also aims to attract foreign investments and support                          empowerment and more participation of women in the sector. The strategy is part of the                         Government’s efforts to establish a robust and cutting-edge digital architecture so digital                         transformation accelerates and supports the Vision 2030 goal of promoting the sector’s                         role  to  build  a  digital  society,  a  digital  government,  a  thriving  digital  economy,  and                         innovation. Saudi Arabia’s digital transformation continues to grow with reports showing                         that the Kingdom’s ICT spending grew six percent in 2018 to $36 billion and is predicted                          to finish in 2019 at the value of $40 billion.  This growth is led by Government, Telecom,                         Finance and Oil/Gas sectors.  Aggressive IT projects to modernize the Saudi Arabian                         Government’s  (SAG)  IT  infrastructure,  including  an  e-government  initiative  and  the                         liberalization  of  the  telecom  industry,  are  increasing  competition,  service  levels,  and                         usage.","8                          E.  Legal and Regulatory                           The paramount body of law in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is the Shari’ah. The Shari’ah                         is comprised of a collection of fundamental principles derived from a number of different                         sources, including the Holy Quran, the Sunnah (sayings of the Prophet Mohammed) and                         the  works  of  Shari’ah  scholars.  In  addition  to  the  Shari’ah,  Saudi  Arabian  law  is  also                         derived  from  enacted  legislation.  Legislation  is  enacted  in  various  forms,  the  most                          common of which are Royal Orders, Royal Decrees, Council of Ministers Resolutions,                         Ministerial Resolutions and Ministerial Circulars. All such laws are ultimately subject to,                         and cannot conflict with, the Shari’ah.                          III. Economic Factors                           A.  Size of Market                           Saudi Arabia is the largest country in the Gulf region with a population of 33 million, and                         the largest economy in the Arab World with a GDP of $ 782 billion.  It is the only G-20-                         member country in the region. Filipinos make up the fourth-largest group of foreigners in                         Saudi Arabia, and are the second-largest source of remittances to the Philippines. Saudi                         Arabia is currently the largest hirer of Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs), and has the                          largest Filipino population in the Middle East.                          B.  National Income                           With  a total  worth  of $34.4 trillion, Saudi  Arabia has the second  most  valuable  natural                         resources  in  the  world. The  country  has  the  second-largest  proven  petroleum                         reserves and is the largest exporter of petroleum in the world. It also has the fifth-largest                          proven natural gas reserves and is considered an \"Energy Superpower”. The economy of                         Saudi Arabia is heavily dependent on oil and is a member of OPEC. In 2016 the Saudi","9                          Government launched its Saudi Vision 2030 to reduce the country's dependency on oil                         and diversify its economic resources. In the first quarter of 2019, Saudi Arabia's budget                         has accomplished its first surplus since 2014. This surplus that is accounted for $10.40                         billion has been achieved due to the increase of the oil and non-oil revenues.                           C.  Purchasing Power                           The Gross Domestic Product per capita in Saudi Arabia was last recorded at 48995.60                         US dollars in 2018, when adjusted by purchasing power parity (PPP). The GDP per Capita,                         in Saudi Arabia, when adjusted by Purchasing Power Parity is equivalent to 276 percent                         of the world's average. In 2019, purchasing power parity for Saudi Arabia was 1.8 LCU                         per international dollars. Purchasing power parity of Saudi Arabia increased from 0.9 LCU                          per international dollars in 2000 to 1.8 LCU per international dollars in 2019 growing at an                         average annual rate of 4.17%. A large percentage of the 750,000 Filipinos in the Emirates                         are college-educated, highly skilled and earning well, a study finds. The role of Filipinos,                         the third largest expatriate community in the UAE, has evolved with growing purchasing                         power and representation across all sectors. The average Filipino, based on the study,                          spends the most money on housing, followed by food and transportation. But they also                         make frequent trips to the mall, with 48 per cent visiting one to two times a month, 32 per                         cent going three or four times and 16 per cent five times. A sizeable portion (43 per cent)                         spend an average of Dh21 to Dh50 per meal when they eat out, while about 16 per cent                         are willing to spend more than Dh80 per meal.                           D.  Availability of Credit                           Credit is essential for the economy to function well. It funds new investments and allows                         people  to  purchase  houses,  cars,  and  other  items.  Of  course,  excessive  lending  and                         borrowing usually end up in financial crises but, in principle, credit availability is good for","10                          economic development. 1968 - 2017: For that indicator, we provide data for Saudi Arabia                         from 1968 to 2017. The average value for Saudi Arabia during that period was 22.43                         percent with a minimum of 2.75 percent in 1974 and a maximum of 58.11 percent in 2016.

See the global rankings for that indicator or use the country comparator                         to compare trends over time. Bank credit in Saudi Arabia and other countries is defined                         as the credit extended by the banking institutions to the private sector only: both firms and                         households. It does not include lending to the government.                           IV. Type of Economy                          According to the definition of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Saudi Arabia is one                          of the developing countries because of its lower economic performance. With a Human                         Development Index (HDI) of 0.854 Saudi Arabia counts as one of the high developed                         economies  by  UN-definition.  However,  the  IMF  does  not  share  this  classification.                         Considering the purchasing power parity Saudi Arabia is among the 30 richest countries                         in the world. In addition, Saudi Arabia has an oil-based economy with strong government                          controls over major economic activities. It possesses about 16% of the world's proven                         petroleum reserves, ranks as the largest exporter of petroleum, and plays a leading role                         in OPEC.","11                                                      ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT                              I. Cultural Background                                  This chapter presents the cultural aspects that has an indirect and direct effect to                         the expansion of Tahopical to the Saudi Arabia market.                              A.  National Culture                                  a.  Identity                                 The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia was formed out of an alliance between Ibn Saud (a                                tribal ruler of the central region) and Ibn ‘Abd al-Wahhab (an Islamic cleric). The                                two shared a goal of uniting the different Arab tribes of the peninsula and returning                                 them  back  to  an  earlier  interpretation  of  the  principles  of  Islam.  This  religious                                revivalist movement birthed the Saudi state and popularized the Wahhabi ideology                                (see Religion). Ibn Saud gained power over multiple regions through a series of                                conquests over the 1920s, eventually declaring himself king in 1932. Saudi Arabia                                has  been  ruled  under  an  absolute  monarchy  since,  and  the  alliance  between                                 religious  clerics  and  the  Al  Saud  family  continues  today.2  State  leadership  is                                passed down to Ibn Saud’s descendants through the male line of the Al Saud                                family.                                 Saudi  Arabians  were  traditionally  tribal  nomads,  villagers  and  townspeople.                                 However,  the  discovery  of  oil  has  transformed  society  through  rapid  economic                                development. The country controls the second largest oil reserves, is the second                                largest  oil  producer  and  is  the  biggest  oil  exporter  in  the  world.3  The  national","12                                 wealth  produced  from  the  industry  has  accelerated  industrialization  and                                urbanization  throughout  Saudi  Arabia.  Most  of  the  country’s  infrastructure  has                                been built since the 1970s. Today, the Saudi population is highly cosmopolitan,                                with over 80% living in the five biggest cities.                                  The social atmosphere of Saudi Arabia remains highly conservative and reserved.                                Religion is a strong source of legitimacy for the Saudi government and the ‘ulamā’                                 (council of religious clerics) have a lot of influence and authority over domestic                                matters.5 Conservative interpretations of Islam are a major social force that dictate                                much of what Saudi Arabians can and cannot do (see Religion). Everyday customs                                and activities serve as a reminder for the importance of Islam, Arab culture and                                tradition. The culture emphasizes the importance of personal ethics and morality.                                One  commonly  finds  Saudis  have  a  strong  sense  of conviction regarding  their                                moral code and the righteousness of their faith. This is reinforced by the education                                 system and the country’s laws (Saudi Arabian Culture - Core Concepts, n.d.).                                 b.  Material Life                                  Saudi Arabia has well-developed transport infrastructure, which mainly includes                                airways,  roadways  and  maritime  transport.  Saudi  Arabia’s  logistics  market  is                                valued at $18 billion, making it the largest among the GCC nations. It accounts for                                55 percent of the total GCC logistics market. Because of the large distances that                                 separate Saudi Arabia's main cities, air travel is the preferred method of domestic                                travel. There are three major, modern international airports in the Kingdom: King                                Khalid  International  Airport  in  Riyadh,  King  Abdulaziz  International  Airport  in                                Jeddah,  and  King  Fahd  International  Airport  in  the  Eastern  Province.  A  large                                number of international airlines operate from these airports. In addition, there are","13                                 22  regional  and  local  airports.  Taxis,  rental  cars,  and  limousines  are  easily                                available at airports. According to the latest data by Invest Saudi, the volume of air                                cargo in 2015 was 1.2 million tons.                                  Saudi Arabia also has an impressive and expanding network of highways which                                connect the country's major regions and cities. Driving is done on the right side of                                the  road.  The  railway  network  in  the  Kingdom  is  undergoing  an  expansion                                 program.  Recently,  the  Saudi  Arabia  Government  invest  in  1,500  km  of  new                                railways.  There  are  seven  modern  major  ports  in  the  cities  of  Jeddah,  Yanbu,                                Dammam,  Jubail,  Jizan,  Rabigh,  and  Dhiba,  some  with  their  own  separate                                commercial and industrial facilities. The Jeddah and Dammam ports are state-of-                                the-art commercial ports. The Yanbu and Jubail ports are state-of-the-art major                                industrial ports with modern bulk cargo and container handling capabilities. Ras                                Tanura, an oil super-terminal on the Gulf, is one of the largest in the world. In 2017,                                 the cargo handled by sea ports was 240 million tons according to Invest Saudi                                (Business Infrastructure, Saudi Arabia, n.d.).                                  c.  Language                                 Arabic is the official language of Saudi Arabia, but English is widely spoken. It is                                used in business and is a compulsory second language in schools. Among the                                non-Saudi population, many people speak Urdu, the official language of Pakistan                                 and other Asian languages such as Farsi and Turkish. Arabic is spoken by almost                                200 million people in more than 22 countries. It is the language of the Qur'an, the                                Holy Book of Islam, and of Arab poetry and literature. While spoken Arabic varies                                from country to country, classical Arabic has remained unchanged for centuries.                                In Saudi, there are differences between the dialects spoken in urban areas and","14                                 those spoken in rural areas as well as between those in the West, East and South                                (Commisceo Global Consulting Ltd., 2020, January 1).                                  d.  Social Interactions                                  Dignity and respect are at the forefront of the Saudi Arabian culture. While some                                Western  cultures  may  be  more  informal  and  casual,  younger  people  in  Saudi                                Arabia are expected to display respect to their elders, use appropriate titles and                                demonstrate the appropriate level of deference. This hierarchical structure also                                translates  to  the  business  world.  Only  top  executives  typically  have  decision-                                making authority. Saudi Arabia business etiquette also dictates that a business                                professional approach and address the most senior person first. companies hoping                                 to  do  business  in  Saudi  Arabia must  also  be  aware  of  differences  in  business                                etiquette  in  Saudi  Arabia.  Communication  by  Saudis  relies  heavily  on  body                                language and non-verbal language including tone of voice and moments of silence.                                Silence indicates contemplation, so it is important not to try to fill this silence and                                oversell. Additionally, business meetings are often less formal in nature than those                                 involved in other countries. These meetings should not interfere with prayer times.                                People from the Middle East often have stronger relationships with others than                                people in other areas of the world. Their personal and business relationships may                                blend with Saudis often using one relationship to further their interests in the other                                type of relationship. Business partners and friends often take a serious interest in                                each other and may invest substantial time in becoming acquainted with others                                and before developing trust in a business relationship. People of other cultures                                 may want to speed through this process, but time must be taken to establish solid                                relationships with people in Saudi Arabia before you can reasonably expect to                                develop  a  business  relationship.  Refusing  a  request  from  another  is  often","15                                 considered poor business etiquette in Saudi Arabia. Hospitality is largely coveted                                in the culture, so using it strategically can help you develop stronger personal and                                professional relationships (Ramadori, 2021).                                  e.  Aesthetics                                  Generally speaking, Red in the Middle East can be associated with love as it is in                                other cultures, in addition to caution, anger, and evil. Green in the Middle East                                represents the religion of Islam and thus most Arabs would associate it with peace                                and spirituality. Green is also used in several national flags as a symbol of Islam.                                Some of these include Afghanistan, Algeria, Iran, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and Sri                                Lanka. Black and white can both represent rebirth and mourning. Modesty can be                                 associated with black as well (Y., 2019, November 5).                                 Appropriate dress is taken very seriously in Saudi society and is an aspect which                                 foreign visitors should familiarize themselves with to avoid giving offence. In public                                Saudis and visitors alike are expected to dress conservatively and foreign men                                should always wear long trousers, not shorts, and long-sleeved shirts. There are                                specific rules for female dress outside the home including covering the hair and                                wearing the abaya, a traditional black over garment. Although non-Saudi, non-                                Muslim women are not expected to wear a veil, it is advisable for foreign women                                to wear the abaya and to carry a headscarf for occasions where covering of the                                 hair is appropriate. Adapting clothing and behaviors to the local circumstances is,                                particularly for women, and can help in establishing new business relationships                                (Guide to Saudi Arabia | Saudi Arabian Etiquette, Customs \& Culture, 2019).","16                                 f.  Religion                                  Saudi Arabia, considered to be the World’s Last Forbidden Kingdom, has a set of                                specific laws to govern its people. The basis for Saudi Arabia’s constitution is their                                religion, Islam, and the Holy Book Quran. The government tends to decide the                                legality of actions based on the Islamic law or on the basis of whether or not it will                                lead people away from Islam. The strictness of Saudi Arabia’s laws also varies                                 based on an individual's gender, as gender roles are very distinct in Saudi Arabian                                culture and society. One restriction implemented in Saudi Arabia is All Muslims,                                under Islamic law, are not allowed to eat pork. Saudis expect non-Muslim foreign                                teachers to abide by this law while teaching in Saudi Arabia too, regardless of their                                own religious beliefs. It won't be too hard to follow this law though, as generally                                only “Halal” foods are allowed to enter the country (Ibanez, 2013).                                  g.  Education                                  Saudi Arabia’s education system has gone through an astonishing transformation.                                When the Kingdom was established in 1932, education was available to very few                                people, mostly the children of wealthy families living in the major cities. Today,                                Saudi Arabia’s education system includes over fifty public and private universities,                                with more planned; some 30,000 schools; and a large number of colleges and                                other institutions. The system is open to all citizens, and provides students with                                 free education, books and health services. While the study of Islam remains at its                                core,  the  modern  Saudi  educational  system  also  provides  quality  instruction  in                                diverse fields of arts and sciences. This diversity helps the Kingdom prepare its                                citizens for life and work in a global economy (About Saudi Arabia, n.d.)","17                                 h.  Value Systems                                  Saudi Arabia is a kingdom covering most of the Arabian Peninsula. The majority                                of the population is ethnically Arab, mostly descending from nomadic tribes that                                have  traditionally  lived  throughout  the  region.  Saudi  culture  is  fundamentally                                traditional and conservative. Islam has an extensive influence on society, guiding                                people’s social, familial, political and legal lives. The Saudi people generally share                                 a strong moral code and cultural values, such as hospitality, loyalty and a sense                                of duty to support their community. They are often highly aware of their personal                                honor  and  integrity.  However,  the  country  is  also  highly  modernized  and                                industrialized. At the time of writing, social norms and rules of behavior are being                                transformed rapidly as the people balance their cultural traditions with the modern                                age. Customs and attitudes can also vary significantly between different regions,                                minorities and tribes.                              B.  Business Culture                                  Saudi Arabian business culture is largely influenced by the collectivist nature of                                Saudi society. The most important social unit is the group, a close family, extended                                family, or extended relationships, to which loyalty and respect is due. Thus, Saudi                                Arabians will prefer doing business with those they know and trust. Social status,                                which depends, inter alia, on age and gender, plays a critical role in Saudi society,                                 including in business relations. Most businesses are vertically hierarchical, with                                decision-making concentrated at the senior level of an organization. The Saudi                                society is extremely bureaucratic, and most decisions require several layers of                                approval.  Saudi  Arabians  are  generally  relationship  oriented  and,  as  trust  is  a                                fundamental principle, it is important to take sufficient time and effort to build a","18                                 personal relation before starting a business relationship. This can mean attending                                several initial meetings where no substantive business is discussed and sharing                                meals (Santander, 2021).                                  Even though about half of the Kingdom’s workforce of 13 million is expat, business                                culture in Saudi Arabia dances to a decidedly local tune. Most decision-makers are                                Saudi  and  people  doing  business  can  expect  unrivaled  Arabian  hospitality,                                 canceled appointments, cordial chat, and hard bargaining in equal measure; all                                washed down with copious amounts of qahwa (a traditional Arabic coffee recipe).                                Flexibility, open-mindedness, and a calm demeanor are essential when going into                                battle  for  business  in  Saudi  Arabia.  Local  business  culture  revolves  around                                personal relationships, consensus, and cohesion of the unit; whether that’s family,                                extended family, or business. Who you are, and who you know (which is known as                                wasta  in  Arabic),  are  important  in  business  circles  here.  Time  spent  getting  to                                 know,  and  gaining  the  trust  of,  business  associates  is  time  well  spent.                                Understanding the unique interplays, and influences, between the families (tribes)                                in  Saudi  society  is  also  useful.  It  might  take  many  meetings,  both  formal  and                                informal, to make any tangible business headway (Lazell, 2021).                              C.  Organizational Culture                                 Dignity and respect are at the forefront of the Saudi Arabian culture. While some                                 Western  cultures  may  be  more  informal  and  casual,  younger  people  in  Saudi                                Arabia are expected to display respect to their elders, use appropriate titles and                                demonstrate the appropriate level of deference. This hierarchical structure also                                translates  to  the  business  world.  Only  top  executives  typically  have  decision-                                making authority. Saudi Arabia business etiquette also dictates that a business","19                                 professional  approach  and  address  the  most  senior  person  first.  While  many                                companies are accustomed to a Monday to Friday work week, this is not the norm                                in Saudi Arabia. The work week in Saudi Arabia begins on Saturday and usually                                ends on Wednesday. Thursday and Friday are the traditional days of rest. This can                                 make  scheduling  business  meetings  more  difficult  when  integrating  workers  in                                Saudi Arabia and other parts of the world.                                  People from the Middle East often have stronger relationships with others than                                people in other areas of the world. Their personal and business relationships may                                blend with Saudis often using one relationship to further their interests in the other                                type of relationship.                                  Business partners and friends often take a serious interest in each other and may                                invest substantial time in becoming acquainted with others and before developing                                trust  in  a  business  relationship.  People  of  other  cultures  may  want  to  speed                                through this process, but time must be taken to establish solid relationships with                                people in Saudi Arabia before you can reasonably expect to develop a business                                 relationship. Refusing a request from another is often considered poor business                                etiquette in Saudi Arabia. Hospitality is largely coveted in the culture, so using it                                strategically can help you develop stronger personal and professional relationships                                (Ramadori, 2021).                           II. Implications of Culture to Marketing Mix                             A.  Product                              The  cultural  setting  of  Saudi  Arabia  is  greatly  influenced  by  the  Arab  and  Islamic                            culture. The society is in general deeply religious, conservative, traditional, and family-","20                             oriented. Today, Saudis follow many of their traditional habits, especially in food and                            drinks.  As  many  Saudis  are  originally  descended  from  tribes  of  sheep  and  goat                            herders, many Saudi dishes are mainly made of sheep meat. Saudi Arabian cuisine is                            similar to that of the surrounding countries in the Arabian Peninsula, and has been                             heavily influenced by Turkish, Persian, and African food. Animals are slaughtered in                            accordance with halal Islamic dietary laws, which consider pork forbidden (haram) and                            alcohol forbidden (haram). As a general rule, Saudis (like other Muslims) consider                            impure  pork  to  be  disgusting,  but  forbidden  alcohol  a  temptation.  Consequently,                            dietary laws regarding the former are more strictly observed than those regarding the                             latter. People of Saudi Arabia are restricted by the religious norms related to food and                            drink.  Thus,  alcohol  is  prohibited  in  Islam  and,  accordingly,  it  is  prevented  in  the                            country. Furthermore, pork is also prohibited and Saudis do not eat it. Nevertheless,                            cows,  sheep,  chicken  and  other  types  of  animals  can't  be  eaten  unless  they  are                            slaughtered according to the Islamic law (Wikipedia contributors, 2021).                              B.  Price                              Saudi Arabia’s population has traditionally been composed of nomads, villagers, and                            townspeople. Pervading this triad, however, is the patrilineal kinship principle, and                            superimposed on all is the administrative organization centered on the royal family.                            The kinship principle is pervasive in Saudi society, and the extended family is a strong                            social unit. Villages constitute local service centers and contain members from more                            than one tribal affiliation, though one group may tend to be dominant. Cities are not                            tribally organized, though the importance of kinship affiliation endures, and local affairs                             tend to be dominated and administered by a few families. Social stratification is more                            clearly developed in the cities than elsewhere. Before the effects of oil were felt on the                            economy, status was a matter of lineage and occupation rather than of wealth; with","21                             the  development  of  the  oil  industry,  however,  wealth  and  material  position  have                            acquired an additional social value. The new technology and industry have produced                            a growing middle-income economic group of technocrats that is increasingly aware of                            the widening gap between the ruling families and the rest of the population. This has                             led to discontent and, in some cases, outbreaks of civil unrest (Saudi Arabia - The                            Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, n.d.).                              C.  Place                             Saudi  Arabia  protects  its  own  people  and  enterprises  over  foreigners.  There  are                            certain  programs  that  encourage  the  purchase  of  goods  and  services  from  local                            suppliers. The country also has objectives to meet certain metrics within a specified                             timeframe. For example, Aramco’s percentage of locally-manufactured goods related                            to the energy field and services is expected to be 70% by the year 2021. Additionally,                            the  country  is  modifying  its  procurement  processes  and  policies  to  meet  localized                            production goals. The Vision 2030 program is setting a metric of 50% locally produced                            and procured defense materials by 2030. It also emphasizes increasing the number of                             local employees that are hired in this capacity.                             D.

Companies try to come up with the most interesting solutions. It’s common to pixelate                            the eyes, but more creative solutions are to let the talents wear sunglasses or come                            up with a concept where the models would have to close their eyes.                              •  Sex","22                             Nudity  is  a  not  allowed  in  any  form.  The  Islamic  culture  is  very  conservative  and                            showing  any  skin  other  than  the  face,  hands  or  feet  can  be  considered  sexually                            arousing, therefore inappropriate for public display.                              •  Homosexuality                              No references to homosexuality can be made in ads.                              •  Witches, Magicians, Vampires or aliens                             Any connotation to supernatural can be considered as another God like force.                              •  Drugs                              Drugs, alcohol or even a champaign glass cannot be shown in advertising. Unless it’s                            an anti-campaign.                              •  Food                             Advertisements for breakfast or other meal never show eggs. Ads for fish, or recipes                            for other products that are eaten with fish, are also close to non-existent. In the Arabian                            Peninsula, fishing is traditionally considered an inferior profession, and selling eggs                             and chickens is likewise not a respectable trade. Alcohol beverages and pork cannot                            be advertised in Saudi Arabia.                              •  Animals                             Although many Arab Muslims keep and love dogs, generally dogs are considered dirty,                             therefore there are no puppies or golden retrievers in the ads. There can be many                            other borderline issues with other animals as well, such as fish means Christianity,                            crow means death or chameleon means hypocrisy","23                             •  Symbols                              The crusades have left a deep wound in the Arab psyche. Any form of crosses can be                            considered offending. There is no Red Cross in the Middle East (it’s Red Crescent).                            Even a snowflake can be considered bad intention, because you can find multiple                            crosses in it. Several other symbols are not to be used as a visual device, such are                            the David’s star, US flag or five-pointed red star. Directional symbols pointing from left                             to right signify backwards direction, since Arab script is to be read from right to left.                             •  Words                              Enjoy or exciting are words that can be interpreted as sexual descriptors therefore to                            be avoided. Words like create and greatest should be used with caution, since they                            are associated with God. Arabic calligraphy is a very creative art, where words can be                            written down by an endless number of forms. One has to be careful how an innocent                             logo would be interpreted.                             •  Flowers                              The use of flowers, and especially roses is well appreciated in Saudi advertisements.

Islam is interwoven into the                             Saudi Arabian culture as it is the birthplace of this religion. The two most revered                            Islamic  places,  Mecca  and  Medina,  are  both  located  in  Saudi  Arabia.  The  Saudi                            Arabian economy is an oil based one and all primary economic activities of this nation                            are closely controlled and monitored by its powerful government. Saudi Arabia is a                            leading player in the OPEC (The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Companies)                            as it ranks as the highest petroleum exporter in the world. This is due to the fact that                            approximately  16%  of  the  world’s  total  petroleum  reserves  exist  within  the  Saudi                             Arabian borders, making it abundant and self-sufficient. Though traditionally, Saudi","25                             Arabia  has  been  aiming  at  diversifying  its  economy  in  the  areas  of                            telecommunications,  petrochemical  sectors,  power  generation  and  natural  gas                            exploration,  latest  developments  see  the  Saudi  Arabian  government  inviting                            investment towards the privatization and development of its healthcare, tourism and                             education sectors. This diversification is necessary for Saudi Arabia to stay afloat even                            in situations in which oil prices drop.                              C.  Government Policies and Regulations                             Saudi  Arabia  is  a  monarchy  ruled  by  the  Āl  Saʿūd,  a  family  whose  status  was                            established by its close ties with and support for the Wahhābī religious establishment.                            Islamic  law,  the  Sharīʿah,  is  the  primary  source  of  legislation,  but  the  actual                             promulgation of legislation and implementation of policy is often mitigated by more                            mundane factors, such as political expediency, the inner politics of the ruling family,                            and the influence of intertribal politics, which remain strong in the modern kingdom.                              The kingdom has never had a written constitution, although in 1992 the king issued a                            document known as the Basic Law of Government (Al-Niẓām al-Asāsī li al-Ḥukm),                            which provides guidelines for how the government is to be run and sets forth the rights                            and responsibilities of citizens. The king combines legislative, executive, and judicial                            functions.  As  prime  minister,  he  presides  over  the  Council  of  Ministers  (Majlis  al-                            Wuzarāʾ). The council is responsible for such executive and administrative matters as                             foreign  and  domestic  policy,  defense,  finance,  health,  and  education,  which  it                            administers through numerous separate agencies. Appointment to and dismissal from                            the council are prerogatives of the king. The Basic Law of Government paved the way                            in 1993 for the establishment of a new quasi-legislative body, the Consultative Council                            (Majlis al-Shūrā), which includes many technical experts; all members are appointed","26                             by the king. The Consultative Council has the power to draft legislation and, along with                            the Council of Ministers, promote it for the king’s approval.                              In  the  end,  however,  all  major  policy  decisions  are  made  outside  these  formal                            apparatuses.  Decisions  are  made  through  a  consensus  of  opinion  that  is  sought                            primarily  within  the  royal  family  (comprising  the  numerous  descendants  of  the                            kingdom’s  founder,  Ibn  Saud),  many  of  whom  hold  sensitive  government  posts.                             Likewise, the views of important members of the ʿulamāʾ (religious scholars), leading                            tribal sheikhs, and heads of prominent commercial families are considered.                          II. Marketing Laws                              A.  Promotions                              Direct marketing is not a widely used technique in Saudi Arabia. Personal relations                            between vendors and customers are extremely important in the Kingdom. Many types                            of direct marketing practiced in other countries are not practiced in Saudi Arabia due                            to  Islamic  precepts  concerning  gender  segregation  and  privacy  in  the  home.  The                            limitations of the Saudi postal system are also a factor. Businesses and private citizens                            use post office boxes because home delivery and postal insurance are not available.                             Limited direct marketing is being conducted through commercials on satellite television                            providing consumers with a local telephone number to arrange purchase and delivery.                              The enduring and profitable economic partnership between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia                            can be an advantage to U.S. businesses in the Kingdom, as most Saudi importers are                            very receptive to U.S. products, and consider them to be state-of-the-art in technology                            and durable despite their higher prices. Foreign firms will find it beneficial to introduce                            complete product lines, rather than individual products, into the Saudi market, as it will","27                             allow them to benefit from greater demand stimulation and cost reductions. A product,                            however,  must  be  competitively  priced  and  readily  available  to  make  a  sale.                            Subsequent or sudden price changes should be avoided, including pricing for after-                            sales service.                              Advertising is a rapidly expanding business in the Kingdom, and is crucial in gaining                            retail sales and market share. According to the Al-Iqtisadiah economic daily, Saudi                             Arabia  spent  $145  million  on  advertising  in  the  first  five  months  of  1998.  Of  that                            amount,  64  percent  was  spent  on  newspapers,  19.5  percent  for  magazines,  8.6                            percent for billboards, and 7 percent for television advertising. Most companies now                            choose  to  advertise  in  a  wide  range  of  media,  including  TV,  newspapers,  trade                            magazines,  billboards,  and  trade  promotion  events.  Lately,  many  companies  have                            been advertising through national festivals, events, and sweepstakes drawings that                            occur usually in malls and shopping centers. TV commercials are broadcast on the                             two Saudi channels during limited periods of the day. One channel is in English, the                            other  Arabic,  which  both  broadcast  over  the  entire  Kingdom.  Contents  of  the                            commercial must conform with religious and moral values. An alternative approach to                            presenting products in the Kingdom is advertising through international TV channels                            such as CNN, the Middle East Broadcasting Corporation (MBC), and Arab Radio \& TV                             (ART). MBC, which is based in London and is Saudi-owned, is similar to CNN with a                            variety of interesting programs. ART, based in Italy, covers more entertainment and                            sports.  Other  Arabic  satellite  channels  have  been  launched  and  are  attracting                            numerous advertisers. Orbit, a Saudi-owned satellite service based in Cyprus, has a                            number of different channels that present American movies and various programming.                              Print  advertising  is  also  important.  In  recent  years,  many  new  magazines  have                            appeared on the Saudi market. Among the popular magazines in the Kingdom are Al-","28                             Majallah, Al-Yamamah, and Sayidati. Newspaper advertising is carried out in local                            English  and  Arabic  papers.  Advertising  rates  vary  greatly,  but  the  rates  are                            considerably lower than in the U.S., largely because of a much smaller readership.                              The three local dailies published in English have circulations of between 20,000 and                            50,000 copies: Arab News (Jeddah); Saudi Gazette (Jeddah); and the Riyadh Daily                            (Riyadh). The leading Arabic newspapers have nationwide distribution and circulation                             of between 70,000 and 100,000: Al-Sharq Al-Awsat, Okaz, Al-Hayat, Al Jazira, and Al                            Riyadh. Um Al Qura is the official government newspaper. Other relevant newspapers                            have lower circulation and at times only regional distribution: Al Bilad, Al Madina, Al                            Nadwa, and Al Youm. Another publication, the Al Iqtisadiah economic daily, focuses                            on business issues.                              B.  Product Development                              •  Technical Standards and Regulations                                Saudi Arabia continues to move toward adherence to a single standard, which is                                often  based  on  International  Organization  for  Standardization  (ISO)  or                                International  Electrotechnical  Commission  (IEC)  standards,  in  technical                                regulations  to  the  exclusion  of  other  international  standards,  such  as  those                                developed  by  U.S.-domiciled  standards  development  organizations  (SDOs).                                 Saudi Arabia’s exclusion of these other international standards, which are often                                used by U.S. manufacturers, can create significant market access restrictions for                                industrial and consumer products exported from the United States.                            •  Branding and Content                                The Saudi market can be very sensitive to branding and materials content.  U.S.                                companies  are  encouraged  to  familiarize  themselves  with  Saudi  traditions,","29                                 customs, and strict observances of the Islamic faith to ensure that branding does                                not unintentionally offend local norms and practices.                             •  Performance and Localization Requirements                                Government-controlled  enterprises  in  Saudi  Arabia  are  increasingly  introducing                                local content requirements for foreign firms.  Aramco’s “In-Kingdom Total Value                                Added” (IKTVA) program, for example, strongly encourages the purchase of goods                                and services from a local supplier base and aims to double Aramco’s percentage                                of locally-manufactured energy-related goods and services to 70 percent by 2021.                                Saudi  Arabia’s  military  is  reforming  its  procurement  processes  and  policies  to                                 incorporate new Saudi employment and localized production goals.  SAG’s Vision                                2030  program  calls  for  50  percent  of  defense  materials  to  be  produced  and                                procured locally by 2030, and simultaneously seeks comparable increases in the                                number of Saudis employed in this sector. “Saudization”, The SAG is adopting                                progressively  stricter  quotas  for  hiring  Saudi  nationals.   U.S. companies  report                                increasing difficulties obtaining visas for expatriate professional employees, others                                 have left the country due to the slowing of opportunities or not had their work visas                                renewed because of this law.  Firms also may face challenges in finding enough                                qualified Saudi nationals to fill jobs.                            •  Intellectual Property Rights Protection                                Despite increased progress on IPR in recent years, enforcement is still lacking in                                several key sectors.  Saudi Arabia was included on USTR’s Special 301 “Priority                                 Watch List” in April 2019, following an increase in IP complaints in the Kingdom,                                particularly with respect to pharmaceuticals, software, digital and signal piracy, and                                counterfeit  goods.  The  Saudi  Authority  for  Intellectual  Property  signed  a                                Memorandum of Understanding with the U.S. Patent Office in 2018, which could                                lead to further improvements of IPR enforcement in the coming years.","30                             •  Counterfeiting                                The  government  has  shown  improvements  in  combatting  the  proliferation  of                                 counterfeit  products  in  recent  years  with  increased  resources  devoted  to                                marketplace  enforcement  and  stricter  penalties  for  copyright  and  trademark                                violators.    However,  enforcement  often  remains  uneven  while  copyright                                enforcement  remains  hampered  by  an  insufficient  number  of  inspectors.                                Moreover, manufacturers of consumer products and automobile spare parts are                                concerned about the availability of cheap counterfeit products in the market place.                                These products are often of Chinese origin.                             •  Delayed Payments                                Companies  that  have  significant  experience  with  government  procurement  in                                country report they have carried Saudi government receivables for years.  Late                                payments  by  the  SAG  to  American  vendors  are  reportedly  a  cash-flow                                management tactic to reduce budget deficits.  The country has struggled in recent                                 years with a budget deficit linked to high spending on “giga” projects and declining                                oil prices.  There is also a lack of due process to recover funds. U.S. companies                                should be sure to conduct all due diligence in protecting themselves from incurring                                non-payment issues through resources such as ExIm bank, letters of credit, or                                payment before shipment as well as vetting potential Saudi companies prior to                                making any deals.  U.S. companies should contact the U.S. Commercial Service                                at the Embassy in Riyadh or Consulates in Dhahran or Jeddah if payment delays                                 persist.                            •  Unsolicited Contracts (Scam)                                The  U.S.  Commercial  Service  in  Saudi  Arabia  has  noticed  an  increase  in  the                                number  of  U.S.  firms  receiving  unsolicited  but  seemingly  attractive  business                                proposals from scam artists.

Perpetrators  of  sophisticated  internet  scams  use  Saudi                                Arabia’s  wealth  and  admiration  for  American  products  and  services  to  lure                                 unsuspecting U.S. companies and citizens with “419” type scams (named for a                                Nigerian law aimed at combating financial crimes).  U.S. businesses should verify                                the  identity  of  any  potential  “partner”  and  the  veracity  of  proposals  before                                committing any resources.                            •  Commercial Disputes Settlements                                 In 2016, the Saudi Center for Commercial Arbitration (SCCA) was established,                                with  arbitration  rules  that  conform  to  internationally  recognized  standards  and                                principles.  The SCCA offers comprehensive dispute-resolution services to both                                domestic and foreign firms.  Some firms have already started incorporating the                                SCCA by reference in their contracts.  SCCA arbitration awards can be enforced                                in  local  courts  if  they  comply  with  Shari’a  law.  The  enforcement  of  foreign                                 arbitration awards for private-sector disputes has yet to be upheld in practice.  SAG                                agencies  are  not  allowed  to  agree  to  international  arbitration  without  express                                approval from the Council of Ministers, which is rarely granted.                              C.  Labelling                             Generally, if the product has an applicable Saudi-specific (SASO) standard or SASO-                            adopted standard, the marking requirements should be as per the SASO standard.  If                             the  product  has  no  applicable  SASO  standard  but  has  an  applicable                            Regional/International  Standard  the  marking  requirements  should  be  as  per  the                            applicable Regional/International Standard.  In other cases where the product has no                            applicable specific standard or the language of the marking is not specified in the","32                             product’s applicable standard, then the marking language can be either in Arabic or                            English.                              All markings pertaining to warnings and safety instructions must be in Arabic or in                            Arabic and English.  Instruction manuals or pamphlets must be in Arabic language or                            in both Arabic and English.                              All containers should be marked with the gross weight and with either the initials or the                            name of the consignee.  If the consignment includes two or more containers, they                            should  be  numbered  consecutively.    All  containers  reportedly  should  be  marked                            showing the country of manufacture.                              All goods consigned to Saudi Arabia should be packed to withstand rough handling,                            extreme heat, and high humidity and to afford full protection against pilferage.  These                            precautions  are  particularly  necessary  because  many  shipments  from  the  United                             States to Saudi Arabia are transshipped enroute.  Boxes should be waterproofed on                            the  inside  and  outside  and  double  strapped  with  metal  bands.    Simple  crating  of                            merchandise does not provide sufficient protection from the weather and from possible                            careless stevedoring at the ports.                              D.  Pricing                             The exchange rate of the dollar has been fixed at 3.75 riyals to the dollar since 1986,                             a  strong  dollar  value  compared  to  the  yen  and  European  currencies.  Reasonable                            interest  rates  have  greatly  facilitated  market  penetration.  Consequently,  Saudi                            importers expect U.S. producers to have a more stable pricing policy than their foreign                            competitors.  Products  are  usually  imported  on  a  CIF  basis,  and mark-ups  depend                            largely on what the vendor feels that the market will bear. No standard formula exists","33                             for determining mark-up rates. For the U.S. supplier, some give-and-take is expected                            in preliminary negotiations. The asking price is often reduced, to entice the client and                            because of the Saudi interest in bargaining and personal exchange.                              Financing  has  become  a  leading  consideration  in  purchasing,  especially  for                            investment  goods  and  repeat  orders.  As  leveraged  transactions  are  becoming  the                            norm, Saudis have come to understand that an attractive financial package can be                             more desirable than a low up-front price.                             E.  Channels of Distribution                              There are three primary marketing regions in the Kingdom: the Western Region, with                            the city of Jeddah as the main commercial center; the Central Region with the capital,                            Riyadh; and the Eastern Province, where the oil and gas industry is concentrated.                              Many  companies  import  goods  for  their  own  use  or  for  direct  sales  to  end-users,                            making the location and number of retail outlets an important factor. U.S. exporters                            might find it beneficial to appoint different agents or distributors for different regions.                            Multiple agencies or distributors might also be assigned to handle diverse product lines                            or  services.  Although  there  is  no  requirement  for  exclusive  distributorships,  Saudi                             Ministry of Commerce policy is that all such arrangements be exclusive with respect                            to either geographic region or product line.                              Many  Saudi  companies  are  active  in  numerous  product  lines.  A  Saudi  agent  will                            typically expect the foreign supplier to assume many of the market development costs,                            such as the hiring of a dedicated sales staff. Foreign suppliers often assign a sales                            person to the Saudi distributor to provide training, marketing, and technical support.","34                             Without such an arrangement, firms should travel to Saudi Arabia regularly to support                            their Saudi distributor.                           III. Impact of Political and Legal Factors to Marketing Mix                              A.  Product                             Importing  the  following  products  requires  special  approval  by  Saudi  authorities:                            agricultural seeds, live animals, books, periodicals, movies, and tapes; religious books                            and  tapes;  chemicals  and  harmful  materials;  pharmaceutical  products;  wireless                             equipment and radio-controlled model airplanes; horses; products containing alcohol                            (e.g.,  perfume);  natural  asphalt;  and  archaeological  artifacts.  Saudi  law  prohibits                            importation  of  the  following  products:  weapons,  alcohol,  narcotics,  pork  and  pork                            products, pornographic materials, distillery equipment, retreaded or used tires, used                            clothing and certain sculptures.  Saudi Customs also does not allow importation of                             cars older than five years, salvaged cars, used police cars, taxis and rental cars.  For                            additional information, please review requirements on the SASO and Saudi Customs                            web sites.                             B.  Price                              On 25/1/1441H (corresponding to 24 September 2019), the Board of Directors of the                            General  Authority  for  Competition  (the  \"Authority\")  issued  the  anticipated                             implementing  regulations  (the  \"New  Implementing  Regulation\")  to  the  new                            Competition Law issued by Royal Decree no. M/75 dated 29/6/1440H (corresponding                            to 6 March 2019 (the \"New Law\"). The New Law no longer requires that such anti-                            competitive  practices  or  arrangements  take  place  between  actual  or  potential                            competitors but instead provides that all practices, including agreements or contracts","35                             \"among entities\", are prohibited if their objective or impact constitutes a violation of                            competition.  The  New  Law  does  not  distinguish  between  horizontal  and  vertical                            relationships. Hence, presumably all practices that are considered restrictive under                            the  New  Law  will  be  prohibited  regardless  whether  the relevant  parties are  actual                             competitors, potential competitors or engaged in a vertical relationship.                             C.  Place                              Only  Saudi  nationals  may  import  goods  for  resale  and  conduct  direct  marketing                            activities; however, foreign industrial entities may conduct trade in the products they                            manufacture, and nationals of GCC member states may engage in certain retail and                            trading activities. In June 2017, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Oman, and Bahrain prohibited                             the importation of products from Qatar and severed their land, sea, and air connections                            with  Qatar.    The  action  has  disrupted  GCC  trade  patterns  and  complicated  doing                            business in the Gulf region for some U.S. companies.                              D.  Promotion                             Marketing is a general plan to deliver a product to the consumer. Advertising is when                            the  product  is  publicized  on  a  variety  of  platforms,  and  is  usually  paid  for.  Many                             companies have been caught in the trap of unauthorized advertising, unaware that                            advertisements in Saudi Arabia are subject to the provisions of the Law of Printed                            Materials and Publication. Also, merely advertising their activities does not exempt an                            applicant from obtaining any licenses that may be required by other regulations.                              Among the most common offenses committed by marketers are intellectual property                            infringements  against  competing  advertisements,  or  other  protected  content  in                            general. Anyone wishing to derive benefit from another’s intellectual property must ask","36                             for permission to use it, and include it in their advertisement only under an agreement                            concluded and documented between the parties. Protection is also afforded by the                            Saudi Authority for Intellectual Property, which plays a role in raising the awareness of                            IP rights holders and authors, and society as a whole. Consumers may also be faced                             with misleading commercial advertisements, and others that are clearly suspicious.                            Sometimes they omit the price of the goods being sold, the duration of a special offer,                            or other crucial details such as discounts on specific items. Some advertisements are                            clearly incompatible with the official license that has been issued for them. It should                            be  noted  that  advertisements  should  contain  a  means  of  communicating  with  the                             advertiser, whether an individual or an institution, so that they may be held accountable                            in case of any offense.                                                   INTERNATIONAL MARKETING PLANNING                             I. Situation Analyses                           Saudi Arabia was the most preferred destination of overseas Filipino workers in 2019,                         government data showed, hosting one out of five Filipinos who landed jobs abroad during                         that year. More than a million Filipinos work in Saudi Arabia, many in construction or as                         domestic helpers or nurses. Tahopical targets Filipino residing in the country as well as                          the local who enjoys trying out new delicacies. Tahopical offers an original Filipino dessert,                         thus a country with a significant Filipino market is an ideal location for such a start-up. This                         assures the business's existence regardless of changes in the competitive environment.                         Furthermore, the Soymilk \& Soy Drinks category is anticipated to expand at the quickest","37                          rate in Saudi Arabia, with a CGAR of 6.3 percent between 2018 and 2023. (India’s Dairy                         and Soy Food Sector Poised to Grow at 8.5% CAGR through 2023, Says GlobalData,                         2019).                           Today, Saudi Arabia is dealing with a series of economic challenges.  They include high                         levels  of  unemployment,  a  large  fiscal  deficit,  and  a  fast-growing  population.                         Unemployment  is  the  highest  among  Saudis  in  their  twenties.    Government  figures                          suggest that approximately 175,000 new jobs are being created each year but the number                         of new job entrants (which is almost exclusively male) is close to twice that figure. U.S.                         Exports  of  consumer-ready  products  to  Saudi  Arabia  increased  by  11%  to  US$587.7                         million in 2019.  The Kingdom is an active importer of U.S. processed foods as well, the                         top market in the Gulf Cooperation Council 6 (GCC-6) bringing in some US$496.3 million                         in 2019, an increase of 17% from the prior year.  Euromonitor has estimated 2019 retail                         sales  in  the  Saudi  packaged  food  market  to  be  US$19.7  billion.    That  represents  an                          increase  of  11.1%  and  nearly  US$1.9  billion  from  2015.    They  also  forecast  sales  of                         packaged food in the Saudi market to reach US$24.9 billion by 2024, an increase of nearly                         US$4.2 billion and 20.6%.  High growth products in the forecast includes Processed meat                         and seafood, Baby food, Baked goods, Ice cream and frozen desserts, Breakfast cereals,                         Processed Fruit and Vegetables, Ready meals, and Savory snacks. It is therefore further                          proven that the Saudi Arabia market is suitable for the expansion of Tahopical.                          II.

III. Competitor Analyses                           The  increased  snacking  habits  among  the  Saudi  consumers  offer  potential  market                         opportunities  for  the  manufacturers,  to  innovate  products.  Companies,  by  introducing                         healthier products within the comparative price range of baked goods and confectionery,                          attract consumers.

Psychographic segmentation                            Social class and lifestyle: Tahopical are marketed as comfort food thus it targets low                             class and middle-class market.

Positioning Strategies                          Although Taho is a popular treat in the Philippines and other neighboring Asian countries,                          it is entirely new to Saudi Arabians which requires the company to exert more effort in its                         market penetration strategies. Tahopical will be localized which means the product and                         service will be modified to suit local conditions. Because Saudi Arabia continued to be the                         most preferred destination of OFWs, Tahopical will focus on satisfying Filipinos residing                         and working in the said country as well as the local who enjoys trying out new delicacies.","42                          Written information in the packaging and menus will be written in both Arabic and English.                         Likewise, the employees will be required to wear a conservative uniform which will be                         inspired to a modern Baro't Saya and Barong, the national clothing of the Philippines, to                         adhere to the culture of Saudi Arabia while still embodying the Filipino spirit.

Specific Objectives and Targets                                   1.  Increase market share to 5% in the snack industry in Saudi Arabia.                                   2.

Launch 2 new flavor of Taho into the market.                           V. Choosing the Strategy                           Tahopical aims for a country-tailored product strategy. Which means the company will be                         making  several  changes  to  the  product  or  communication  strategy  to  suit  the  local                         marketplace. A Product Extension Communications Adaptation strategy will be used since                         Tahopical aims to introduce a Filipino snack to the Saudi Arabian market. Thus, the same                         product is chosen but a different communications strategy applies. Also, due to cultural                          and language differences- communications needs to be adapted.","43                                               MARKETING PRODUCTS AND SERVICES                              I. Marketing Mix                              A.  Product                                                           Our product Taho is a well-known sweet treat in the Philippines. The white pudding                            part of Taho is actually tofu. It is called soft silken tofu because of its soft texture and                            shiny appearance. It had to be made from scratch by the magtataho in the                            Philippines using soy beans. Taho made with silken tofu, sago or boba pearls, and                            simple brown sugar syrup. Served warm, it’s popular as a comforting breakfast or                            merienda (snack) any time of the day. And to make it more innovative we add some                             flavor on our Taho like classic Taho, ube, strawberry, melon, panda, chocolate and                            etc.                             B.  Price","44                             Tahopical decided to use Cost-plus Pricing strategy in computing the price of the                            Taho products. Cost-plus pricing is a pricing strategy in which the selling price, of                            goods and services, is determined by adding a specific fixed markup percentage to a                            singular product's unit cost. Essentially, the markup percentage is the company's                             way to generate a profit margin that reaches their target rate of return and maximizes                            their overall profits. The markup percentage can be derived by using the firm's target                            rate of return. An alternative pricing method is value-based pricing. Our small cup                            price is 5.03 Saudi Riyal (SAR) or 65 pesos (PHP) contains 12 oz. And for our                            medium cup price is 6.19 SAR or PHP 80 contains 16 oz. And lastly our large cup                             price is 7.35 SAR or PHP contains 22 oz.                             C.  Place                              We decided to expand our Taho business in Saudi Arabia since despite the change                            in the competitive environment, a target market that will surely patronize our product                            resides and work in the said country. Also, like Philippines, Saudi Arabia experience                            only two weather, cold and warm, which is both an ideal season for consuming Taho.                              D.  Promotion                              For the first year of the business our marketing strategy will be both traditionally and                            digitally. All promotional materials will be localized to adapt to the difference in                            culture and language. We will make poster and distribute flyers. For the poster, it will                            contain the company logo, product, information, and price. This will be set up in the                            store booth. As for the flyers, it will contain the company logo, product information,                             price and the address of the booth. This will be the miniature version of the poster.                            These will be distributed by some members of the company when roaming around                            the country and will come along with the product when purchased. Also, culturally","45                             sensitive commercial will be produced which will cater both Filipino and Saudi                            Arabian market. We will make social media pages to promote our business online in                            that way when they saw our stores, they know what we offer. We will also create our                            own website so that we will reach wider audience and increase our online presence.                              E.  Process                              After a year, Tahopical became successful and wants to expand their business in                            Saudi Arabia. In that way Tahopical will be known in different countries and many                            people will know our business. By doing good services and good quality of Taho they                            ever taste in that process our customers will come back to our store.

People                              Company marketing staff will promote the importance of Filipino culture and tradition                            to the community of Saudi Arabia. The company’s marketing staffs are to ensure that                            the product meets the expectations of the customers- in the product’s quality, taste,                            affordability, and being purely Filipino. And we prefer Filipino workers as our staff to                            help them have a job even though our business is in other countries.                              G.  Physical Evidence                              Our store design will be Filipino and Arabic culture inspired. Our walls will be painted                            different tourist spot in the Philippines so that it feels like we brought the Philippines                            to them especially to those Filipinos residing and working for years in Saudi Arabia.                            Also, the overall vibe of the store will be like of that in a Bahay Kubo or a nipa hut.                            And for Arabic inspired design we will add famous spots that can be found in Saudi","46                             Arabia.

Promotional Mix                           The marketing approaches Tahopical will be using to optimize promotional efforts and                         reach a broader audience are Advertising, Direct selling, and Sales promotion.                         Advertising through Tv commercial, websites, social media ads, posters and flyers will                         be used to increase brand awareness. Also, direct selling in which a sales representative                         will persuade the target market to avail Tahopical product will be used to develop close                         relationship with the costumer and also to receive immediate response. Lastly, Sales                         promotion such as sales discounts, coupons, etc. will also be used to engage existing                          consumers and bring in a larger audience.

A proper marketing plan has been used                         by the company to enter into Saudi Arabian market. The management of the company                         had to understand and conduct the market analysis by considering political, economic,                         and demographic aspects. The mode of operation was started by wholly owned ownership                         basis.  The  market  was  segmented  on  the  basis  of  demographic,  psychographic,                         behavioral and geographic aspects. It was targeted on the basis of the region, age and                          the income group. Points of difference are being created with the taste and cultural factor                         in the market. The products had been positioned in the minds of Arabian consumers by                         advertisement, sales promotion, and using the social marketing concepts. The marketing                         mix such as product, price, place, promotion, people, process and physical evidence have                         been integrated well with the Tahopical marketing strategy to market its products. The                         company will follow the ethical marketing strategies to grow the business at national and                          the international level.","50                                                             REFERENCES                              About Saudi Arabia.

It  was                         Pinoy Coco-Azukalan because it aims to introduce coco sugar product, produced in the                          Philippines,  around the globe  like  Australia.  There  is  such  thing  called  “Filipino  Pride”                         which means that Filipinos are unique individuals. Being a Filipino is a pride, and this pride                         is our Philosophy and a reflection of our product. Like Filipinos, this sugar is pure and                         natural.  The  coco-sugar  that  was  offered  was  purely  natural  and  ensures  that  it  is                         beneficial.                                 According to Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, (2021). Australians have a                         high  percentage  of  a  diabetic,  an  estimated  1.2  million  Australians  (4.9%  of  the  total                         population) had diabetes from 2017-2018. Sugar in Australia is quite expensive because                         of the high demands. These are some of the factors to formulate a decision in exporting                         our product, but they’re still risks at the same time to be addressed. Exporting a product                         like ours will take too many risks, it will compete in the market where competition is very                         high, and also it is uncertain if Australians will patronize this product but we are taking the                          risks after seeing its potential to promote and to provide natural, healthy, and beneficial                         sweetener to Australians, and the high demands of sugar products in Australia is also a                         good thing to consider.                                 Pinoy Coco-Azukalan will provide premium quality sugar with a fit and reasonable                         price to the consumer’s preferences. This will offer organic and healthy sugars made from                         coconut  with  a  lot  of  health  benefits.  This  will  give  an  excellent  customer  service  by                          building positive relationships with consumers, providing different variations of sugar like                         powdered, finest, and cubes and offers a healthy quality of sugars that is suitable to their                         tastes.","4                                                         ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT                             I.   Economic Background                                Australia is one of the wealthiest Asia–Pacific nations and has enjoyed more than                            two decades of economic expansion. After Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull resigned                            his seat in 2018, Scott Morrison formed a Liberal Party minority government and went                            on  to  win  an  upset  victory  in  May  2019  parliamentary  elections.  Australia  is                            internationally competitive in financial and insurance services, technologies, and high-                             value-added  manufactured  goods.  Mining  and  agriculture  are  important  export                            sectors.  Australia’s  15  free-trade  agreements  include  FTAs  with  the  U.S.,  China,                            Japan, South Korea, and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. Negotiations on                            similar agreements are ongoing with the European Union and expected to begin with                            the United Kingdom now that it has left the EU.                                 Australia has been a leader in economic freedom ever since the inception of the                            Index in 1995, and its economy has been in the highest (free) category for the past 15                             years. The country’s scores on the three rule-of-law indicators (property rights, judicial                            effectiveness, and government integrity) are among the highest in the world.                            II.   PESTL Analysis                                   A.  Political                                              Australia  has  a  mixed  economic  system  in  which  the  economy                                       includes a variety of private freedom, combined with centralized economic                                       planning and government regulation. Australia is a member of Asian Pacific                                       Economic Cooperation (APEC) and the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP).","5                                               Australia  is  proud  of  their  stable  political  environment,  uniform                                       intellectual  property  laws  and  strategic  plans  that  makes  Australian                                       economy  continuously  grow  up.  Australian  stable  political  environment                                       makes  it  become  an  internationally  competitive destination for  business                                        and investment development. A stable political environment becomes more                                       important to local and international businesses and industries, because of                                       global financial challenges. Australia has been ranked as second in the top                                       10  most  politically  stable  countries  in  the  world,  ahead  of  many  major                                       countries. In addition, Australia is more stable than America. In the face of                                        current  global  financial  challenges,  Australia  provide  a  safe  and                                       competitive operating environment to businesses and industry.                                    B.  Economic and Currency                                              The  Australian  dollar  is  the  currency  of  Australia,  including  its                                       external territories: Christmas Island, Cocos Islands, and Norfolk Island. It                                       is officially used as currency by three independent Pacific Island states:                                        Kiribati, Nauru, and Tuvalu. It is legal tender in Australia.                                              The politics of Australia take place within the framework of a federal                                       parliamentary constitutional monarchy. Australia has maintained a stable                                       liberal democratic political system under its Constitution, one of the world's                                       oldest, since Federation in 1901.                                   C.  Social and Cultural Factors                                              Religious diversity and social cohesion have long been seen to be                                        at odds with each other. Classical sociology, grounded in the Westphalian                                       solution to religious conflict in Europe presumed that a single religion was                                       necessary for social cohesion. The issue of religious diversity and social","6                                        cohesion has come to the fore as once religiously monochrome societies                                       have  become  diverse  through  migration  and,  to  a  lesser  degree,                                       conversion. While European nations question the possibility of multicultural                                       and multi-faith societies living in productive harmony, Australia offers an                                        example of a successful multicultural and multi-faith society. Australia has                                       produced a multicultural society through a policy of social inclusion and                                       mutual respect, in contrast to European policies which produce separate                                       community  development.  This  cross-national  comparative  study  reveals                                       demographic and socio-cultural differences that are likely to explain some                                        of the comparative success of Australia in producing social inclusion and                                       avoiding  the  othering  of  religious  minorities,  especially  of  Muslims.                                       Australia has a particular demographic that features multiple substantial                                       minority religious communities living in ways that promote daily encounters                                       among people of different backgrounds.                                     D.  Technological Factors and Infrastructure                                               Australia is one of the most technologically advanced countries in                                       the world. It is well-known for adopting new technologies at a faster rate                                       than  many  other  developed  countries.  The  country  has  witnessed  an                                       enormous growth in technology over the years.                                              It  entered  the  new  millennium  with  one  of  the  highest  rates  of                                        internet access in the world. The growth of technology in Australia has had                                       several important results. It has increased opportunities for innovation and                                       design,  helped  various  industries  make  improvements  in  their  already                                       existing establishments, and helped to improve the quality of their goods.                                       The technology growth has also helped to improve Australia’s economy, as","7                                        it  is  now  one  of  the  leading  countries  in  the  world  for  importing  and                                       exporting goods.                                              Australia's  economic  prosperity  is  dependent  on  a  strong  land                                       transport network that safely and reliably connects people and businesses.                                        Transport  infrastructure  connects  people  to  jobs,  their  homes  and  their                                       communities.  Australian  businesses  rely  on  transport  infrastructure  to                                       connect  to  domestic  and  global  export  markets.  And  The  efficient                                       movement of people and products grows our economy and improves the                                       live ability of our cities and regions.                                    E.  Legal and Regulatory                                        Australian  Government  and  state  and  territory  government  legislation                                       exists to protect consumers, the environment and the community, as well                                       as  to  promote  fair  trading  and  competition.  These  laws  govern  how                                       businesses interact with their suppliers, customers and other businesses.                                    •  Competition laws                                     Australia has a national statutory framework to ensure that trading is fair for                                   businesses and consumers. This framework is administered and enforced by                                   the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC).                                    In addition to Australian Government legislation, state and territory laws govern                                   consumer  protection.

These  standards  are  designed  to  ensure  harmful                                   products  are  not marketed  in  Australia.  The  standards  are  enforced  by the                                   Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC).                                     State  and  territory  government  fair  trading  offices  are  also  involved  in  the                                   enforcement of product safety rules. The role of state and territory offices is                                   primarily to assist consumers.                                    •  Privacy laws                                    Australia  has  national  privacy  legislation,  overseen  by  the  Office  of  the                                   Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC), that regulates how businesses                                   can collect, access, and store personal information and communication.

Economic Factors                                    A.  Size of Market                                        In Australia is the tenth largest market for eCommerce with a revenue of                                   US$27 billion in 2020, placing it ahead of Indonesia and behind Canada. With                                    an  increase  of  22%,  the  Australian  eCommerce  market  contributed  to  the                                   worldwide growth rate of 26% in 2020. Revenues for eCommerce continue to                                   increase.  New  markets  are  emerging,  and  existing  markets  also  have  the                                   potential for further development. Global growth will continue over the next few                                   years. This will be propelled by East and Southeast Asia, with their expanding                                    middle class and lagging offline shopping infrastructure.                                      B.  National Income                                              GDP in Australia is expected to reach 1320.00 USD Billion by the                                       end of 2020, according to Trading Economics global macro models and                                       analysts expectations. In the long-term, the Australia GDP is projected to                                        trend around 1370.00 USD Billion in 2021 and 1480.00 USD Billion in 2022,                                       according to our econometric models.                                   C.  Purchasing Power                                               In  2020,  purchasing  power  parity  for  Australia  was  1.5  LCU  per                                       international dollars. Though Australia purchasing power parity fluctuated                                       substantially in recent years, it tended to increase through 2001  - 2020                                        period ending at 1.5 LCU per international dollars in 2020.                                               Purchasing power parity conversion factor is the number of units of                                       a  country's  currency  required  to  buy  the  same  amounts  of  goods  and","10                                        services  in the  domestic market  as  U.S.  dollar would  buy  in the  United                                       States. This conversion factor is for GDP.                                       D.  Availability of Credit                                              Credit  availability  in  both  Australia  and  overseas  has  tightened                                       primarily because of the increase in risk premier experienced in financial                                       markets in the aftermath of the sub-prime mortgage market crisis and its                                       coda, the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008.                                              The worst of the problem was experienced in overseas financial                                       markets, particularly in the US, Europe and UK.  Increased aversion to risk                                        by  overseas  financial  institutions  initially  meant  a  lack  of  willingness  of                                       hitherto relatively ‘riskless’ banks to lend between themselves in short-term                                       money markets.                                              Further  down  the  credit  line,  this  was  reflected  in  a  significant                                       increase in the credit standards being applied to ‘riskier’ borrowers such as                                        smaller businesses, potential home mortgages and consumers.  The riskier                                       the borrower was perceived to be, for example small business and firms                                       exposed to the global economy, the increasingly more difficult it was for                                       borrowers to obtain finance for investment and/or working capital.                                              Various  policy  measures,  including  bank  bailouts  and  part-                                       nationalizations, had an impact in averting a collapse of the global financial                                       system but the consequences of the global financial crisis are still seen in                                        the slow recoveries being experienced in the economies most affected,                                       including the United States, Europe and the United Kingdom.","11                                               In  the  Australian  case,  the  problems  affecting  interbank  lending                                       were  significantly  less  severe  than  overseas  given  the  relatively  low                                       exposure to falling asset prices and therefore deterioration in bank balance                                       sheets.    Government  guarantees  of  bank  deposits  also  assisted  in                                        stemming the potential for loss of confidence in the local financial sector.                          IV. Type of Economy                                 The economy of Australia is one of the largest mixed market economies in the                         world, with a GDP of AUD$1.62 trillion as of 2015. Australia’s total wealth is AUD$6.4                                                                                                             th                                                     th                        trillion. In 2012, it was the 12  largest national economy by nominal GDP and the 17 -                        largest measured by PPP-adjusted GDP, about 1.7% of the world economy. Australia is                               th                                                         th                        the  19 -largest  importer  and  19 -largest  exporter.  The  Reserve  Bank  of  Australia                        publishes quarterly forecasts of the economy.                                 The Australian economy is dominated by its service sector, comprising 68% of                         GDP. The mining sector represents 7% of GDP; including services to mining, the total                         value of the mining industry in 2009-10 was 8.4% of GDP. Economic growth is largely                          dependent on the mining sector and agricultural sector (12% of GDP) with the products to                         be exported mainly to the East Asian market. Despite the recent decline of the mining                         boom in the country, the Australian economy has remained resilient and stable.                                 The Australian Securities Exchange in Sydney is the largest stock exchange in                                                                           th                        Australia  and  in  the  South  Pacific  and  ranks  14   in  the  world  in  terms  of  market                        capitalisation. Australia is home to some of the largest companies in the world, including                          but not limited to, BHP Billiton, National Australia Bank, Commonwealth Bank, Rio Tinto                         Group, ANZ, Westpac, Telstra, Macquarie Bank,Woolworths and AMP – which also are                         the 10 largest companies in Australia.","12                          Sectors                                 Mining Coal is mined primarily in Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria.                                54% of the coal mined in Australia is exported, mostly to East Asia. In 2000/01,                                 258.5 million tonnes of coal was mined, and 193.6 million tonnes exported. Coal                                provides about 85% of Australia’s electricity production. Australia is the world’s                                leading coal exporter.                                 Manufacturing The manufacturing industry in Australia has declined from 30% of                                GDP in the 1960s to 12% of GDP in 2007.                                 Agriculture contributes 3% of Australia’s GDP at the farm gate and when value-                                added processing beyond the farm is included this figure rises to 12%. 60% of farm                                 products are exported.                                 Services IT related jobs (such as computer system design and engineering) are                                defined as Professional, Scientific and Technical Services by the Department of                                Education,  Employment  and  Workplace  Relations  of  Australia.  IT  job  creation                                occurs mostly in the state capital cities of Australia.                                  Finance Australia’s four ‘Big Banks’ are among the ‘World’s 50 Safest Banks’ as                                of April 2012. The four largest banks in Australia are also known as the “Big Four”.                                 Tourism In the financial year 2010-11, the tourism industry represented 2.5% of                                Australia’s  GDP,  at  a  value  of  about  $35  billion  to  the  national  economy  –                                equivalent to $94.8 million a day to the Australian economy. Domestic tourism is a                                significant part of the tourism industry, and was responsible for 73% of the total                                 direct tourism GDP.","13                                 Media In 2011-12, Australia was ranked 30  out of 179 countries in accordance to                                                                         th                               press freedom.

I.      Situation Analyses                                       An  estimated  1.2  million  Australians  (4.9%  of  the  total  population)  had                                diabetes in 2017–18, based on self-reported data from the Australian Bureau of                                Statistics (ABS) 2017–18 National Health Survey. This estimate includes people                                with type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, and type unknown, but excludes gestational                                 diabetes.                                        Information based on self-reported data only is likely to underestimate the                                prevalence of diabetes as it does not include people with undiagnosed diabetes.

January 2022","EXECUTIVE SUMMARY                          A shell or seashell, additionally referred to just as a shell, is a hard, defensive external                 layer for the most part made by a creature that lives in the ocean. The shell is important for                 the body of the creature. Void shells are frequently tracked down appeared on sea shores by                 wanderers. The shells are unfilled in light of the fact that the creature has kicked the bucket                 and the delicate parts have deteriorated or been eaten by another creature.                      A shell is normally the exoskeleton of an invertebrate (a creature without a spine), and is                 ordinarily made out of calcium carbonate or chitin. Most shells that are found on sea shores                  are the shells of calcium carbonate, and bear better compared to shells made or chitin.                      Aside from mollusk shells, different shells that can be found on sea shores are those of                 barnacles, horseshoe crabs and brachiopods. Marine annelid worms in the family Serpulidae                 make shells which are tubes made of calcium carbonate solidified onto different surfaces. The                 shells of ocean imps are designated ‘tests’, and the shed shells of crabs and lobsters are                  exuviae. While most shells are outside, a few cephalopods have interior shells.                      Our product which is Luscious Seashell can use as gifts or souvenir in any events, it can                 also use as decoration in house specially in kitchen or dining room.                      Shells have been utilized by people for various purposes since the beginning and ancient                 times.  In  any  case,  shells  are  not  by  any  means  the  only  sort  of  shells;  in  different                 environments, there are shells from freshwater creatures, for example, freshwater mussels                 and freshwater snails, and shells of land snails.","PRODUCT OVERVIEW                     I. Product Concept                      Seashells or simply shells have various types and sizes. Animals from the sea are the                 ones who usually create it. These shells are mostly collected from around the world because                 of its vivid and unique construction. They are used for decorations, jewelry and buttons in the                 industry. Hence, they are not only used as display but also some of them can be eaten. These                  shells also help the country’s economy because of its uses and can be a great medium for                 researches.                      Since Philippines is surrounded by bodies of water, we can’t deny that or country is fond                 of seashells. Plenty of handicrafts and decorations are being made of it. In 2016, Department                 of science and Technology (DOST) granted to boost the Capiz’ handicraft production in Cavite                  known in the Philippines as the mother-of-pearl shells. The granted them a new set of planting                 facility  with  complete  accessories  and  low-cost  furnace  dry  to  develop  and  enhance  the                 production capacity and quality. Through this, Cavite will be able to promote the importance                 of seashells to the industry and spread awareness on how these shells help or ecology to                 move forward. According to the 2001 Fisheries Administrative Order 208 of Philippines Laws,                 they must protect and conserve the rare, threatened and endangered species od shells from                 the people who collects and damages them only for their personal purposes.                       We may think that shells are just shells but to biodiversity and ecology they mean so much                 than just a decoration. Shells are said to be the major players in the web of life. Once they are                 wiped out it would result in ecological imbalance that would result not only to our loss but also                 to the animals who mostly relies on it. It serves as the shelter of smaller marine lifeforms and                 some of kind of crabs. Some shells help fight the ocean acidification and the removal of large                 shells will also affect the rate of shore erosion.","II. Market Size                      According to Paul Zahl Ph. D. of National Geographic (1969), Philippines together with its                  thousands of islands, reefs and marine habitats, the country is considered a mecca of sea                 shell collectors. Along the vast region of the Philippines lies the Indo-Pacific region of the                 Philippines lies the Indo-Pacific region which contains the world’s most diverse sea shells.                 One of the best hunting grounds are said to be in the islands of Sulu Sea and also the province                 of Cavite.                       There are 12,000 or more species of seashells in the Philippines, both the largest shells,                 Tridacna gigas, and smallest shells, Pisidum, can be found on the Philippines waters. Not only                 does the country has beautiful seashells but also has shells that can be eaten. It is common                 in Philippine cuisine to have different foods with shells such as mussels, mollusks and oyster.                      Also, based on the study by Solidum, J.N (2011), several coastal islands especially the                 province of Cavite, produce most of the various types of shell waste that are normally thrown                 away on open garbage areas which somehow cause numerous problems to the citizens. So,                  in order to lessen the wastes being deployed, the wastes being reused and recycled. One of                 the products which clearly shows the reuse and recycle method is the Luscious Seashells.

January 2022","EXECUTIVE SUMMARY                           For those who don't know, Embutido is a Philippine version of meatloaf only it is hand                 made with ground pork and stuffed with hard-boiled eggs, sliced ham, variety of vegetables or                  various sausages. Pretty much can be designed according to your taste and liking that will suit                 your palate.                         Tinudopa uses 'Tinapa' known as 'Smoked fish', which is abundant especially in the                 southern province of Cavite, specifically at the coastal town of Tanza, wherein Fishing Industry                 is the town people's source of livelihood.

We want to share the taste of traditional, home-made Filipino cuisine at                 an affordable and convenient price.","PRODUCT OVERVIEW                   I.  Product Concept                      Filipinos  always  finds  a  way  of  adopting  anything  foreign  that  we  like  If  not  that,  the                  Filipinos  may  just  have  our  own  version  of  something  and  does  not  have  to  copy  from                 foreigners. Whichever is the case, there is a Filipino version of the meatloaf – the Embutido.                      Much like lumpia, Embutido is a popular dish prepared and enjoyed at Filipino gatherings                 and other special occasions. It can be served hot or chilled, and is usually dipped in banana                 ketchup or some other type of dipping sauce. Embutido is a staple Filipino dish for the holidays.                  But many homes do not limit their enjoyment of the embutido to a holiday. The dish maybe                 prepared in volume and stored in the refrigerator to last for several days or weeks. Then it                 may be enjoyed every day or anytime during the day while it lasts.                       Many Filipino families have their own heirloom embutido recipes. Which may be taken to                 mean that the dish has been around in the country for quite a while already – “a while” meaning                 several generations. Yes, different embutido recipes would have their own twist to the dish.                 Embutido may be served fresh from the fridge or fresh from the frying pan. And while embutido                 is basically meatloaf, when the dish is called embutido the suggestion is that it’s homemade.                  Meatloaf is mainly understood as the commercial type found in supermarkets while embutido                 is the type that is especially made at home.                      As of our own version, we further developed the popularly known Filipino dish, Embutido                 into Tinapa-embutido or smoked-fish embutido. It is a fish counterpart and took inspiration                 of the iconic Filipino meatloaf, which is the Embutido. It uses the equally iconic 'Tinapa' known                 as 'smoked-fish', which is abundant especially in the southern province of Cavite, specifically,                 at the coastal town of Tanza. The origin of using Fish in exchange of other proteins such as                  chicken or pork meat in the traditional embutido, can be traced when Spain colonized the                 Philippines for three and a half centuries beginning in the middle of the 15th century. During                 that time, the Spaniards introduced different recipes. In other words, “Embutido” belongs to a","category of sausage recipes during the Spanish colonial period. Like most Filipino dishes in                 Philippine culinary history, Embutido has evolved over the passage of time from its Spanish                 origin.  Embutido  was  developed  by  Filipinos  to  suit  their  own  taste  and  liking,  hence  the                 development of 'Tinapa-embutido' also now known as Tinudopa.                    II.  Market Size                      The  love  of  meat  products  by  local  consumers  in  the  Philippines  saw  a  rise  in  meat                 consumption, most specifically for pork meat. By 2021, it was forecasted that pork would be                 the most consumed type of meat in the Philippines at approximately 15 kilograms per person                  per annum. The leading meat products consumed in the country are chicken and pork based.                 In 2020, the pork consumption per capita in the Philippines was about 14.9 kilograms per                 person,  while  13.74  kilograms  of  poultry  meat  per  capita  were  consumed  per  person.  In                 situations where animal feeds are at a shortage due to adverse weather conditions, or rising                 fuel prices halt the deliveries of meat, ripple effects are manifested mainly in pricing. In this                 case,  consumer's  interest  in  purchasing  meat  steers  the  increasing  domestic  price  of  the                 market.                       Filipino consumers shop almost daily on a needs basis in wet and dry markets, which                 make up the largest distribution channel for fishing industry. With this being said, consumers                 now  look  for  alternatives  in  pork  or  chicken  meat,  which  are  Fish.  And  according  to  the                 Department of Agriculture (2021), Fish are now more affordable as supply stabilizes in Metro                 Manila, which also means, that the price of local-fresh marine fish commodities in the NCR                  has begun to stabilize. With the resumption of large supplies of fresh marine commodities in                 the market, consumers now have more affordable fish to choose from and put on their tables.                 The abundance of supply now is perfectly in time with the country's urgent need to ramp up                 efforts to ensure the nation's food security as we battle an even stronger challenge of the                 covid-19 pandemic.","III. Consumer Trends                      The  simplest  dishes  are  often  the  best,  and  proof  of  this  is  the  humble  embutido  or                 meatloaf. It’s practically just a log of minced meat peppered with whatever ingredients and                 techniques are available in the country it is adapted in.                       In South Africa, there’s bobotie, which is spiced with curry and topped with eggs, while in                 the Middle East, the meat, made typically with lamb, clings onto sticks as they are grilled.                 Indonesia has otak-otak where fish replaces beef, and, instead of being baked, is wrapped in                 banana leaves then kissed by hot charcoal. Another technique used is steaming, like on the                 Chinese zheng rou bing, which is composed of pork and scallions. There are many other                  variations:  Vietnam  has  gio,  Bulgaria  has rulo  Stefani,  Chile  has  asado aleman, Italy  has                 polpettone, and our country has embutido, the egg-embedded, raisin-speckled meatloaf of our                 youth.                       Not everyone's a fan of embutido partly because it is a mix of ground pork, hotdog, boiled                 eggs, relish, raisins etc. and then people can eat it cold which makes it more pretty unsettling.                 But  still,  there  are  those  who  love  the  dish  enough  that  it  remains  a  staple  at  all  special                  occasions and gatherings. Therefore, Filipinos have come up with different versions of it to                 eat during holidays or on a daily basis as 'ulam'. In our case, we use Tinapa or Smoked Fish                 in exchange of pork meat, making it an even affordable dish.                       There is currently little to no direct competition for Tinapa Embutido as it is neither popular                 nor well-known in the market. Not only it has a different approach on how Tinapa was usually                 served, but also it is an affordable alternative in the kitchen instead of using chicken or pork                 meat on Embutido. This gives our product a unique and distinct competitive advantage as well                 as the fact that it is easy to distinguish for the consumers. It is a fresh, and home-made product                  that  can  be  prepared  just  as  simply  as  the  store-bought  brands  or  fried  directly  for  the                 customers upon purchase.                       Believed to have been introduced during the American occupancy, the embutido is an                 underrated dish usually reserved for special occasions. But its simplicity begs regularity. Its","level of difficulty is akin to a boxed mix: You toss everything into a bowl, make sure they’re                 well-combined, wrap in foil, and then steam.                       Best of all, it adjusts to your liking. Substitute chicken eggs for quail eggs for aesthetics,                  throw in chopped nuts for texture and slather on banana ketchup for a slightly sweet flavor—                 embutido, or any type of meatloaf for that matter, can be designed to suit your palate, and it’s                 for these reasons why it deserves prevalence and more credit than it is given.","SITUATIONAL ANALYSIS                   A.

Product Concept                      Powdered milk, also called dried milk, or milk powder, is a manufactured dairy                  product made by evaporating milk to dryness. One purpose of drying milk is to preserve it;                 milk powder has a far longer shelf life than liquid milk and does not need to be refrigerated,                 due to its low moisture content. Another purpose is to reduce its bulk for the economy of                 transportation.                      According to Customized report service(2019),Canada is the third largest import source                  of powdered skim milk for the Philippines, after the United States (U.S.) and the European                 Union (EU). Imports of powdered skim milk from Canada have grown 62.8% annually over                 the past five years (2013-2017). The Philippines relies almost 100% on imports for all its                 dairy needs. The U.S. is the largest powdered skim milk supplier to the Philippines with                 84.1% of total imports, followed by the EU (13.4%), and Canada (2.0%). Imports from New                 Zealand and Australia have duty free access for dairy products through Association of                 Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) agreements.                       Milk powder is among the several pasteurized form of fresh milk with all the necessary                  efficient nutrients such as standard amino acids, the building blocks of proteins, and are high                 in soluble vitamins and minerals. Due to its powder form and mobility it is a common item in                 the UN food supply program addressing hunger and food security and it longer shelf life                 augments its retail value in supermarkets. Increasing number of births and child population                 are the major factors affecting the global powdered milk market size.","II.

For the same period, there has been a 3.0% annual increase                 in the retail sales of powdered skim milk in the Philippines. Nestle, Royal Friesland Campina,                 and Fonterra are the market leaders with their brands mainly targeting the country's                 low-income population, which is around 82 million people, or 80% of 103 million people.                 Filipino consumers shop almost daily on a needs basis in small, traditional grocery stores,                 which make up the largest distribution channel for drinking milk products. These offer                  products in small, affordable package sizes. Powdered and shelf stable milk make up 87.3%                 of drinking milk product retail sales mainly due to the limited availability and affordability of                 fresh milk and refrigeration in the country.                       III. Market Shares                        Filipino consumers shop almost daily on a needs basis at independent/traditional","grocers called sari-saris. These stores make up the largest distribution channel for milk                 products, at 56.5% of grocery retailers. This channel is popular in rural areas as they serve                 as the hub of many communities and offer products in small package sizes that are                 affordable, which is a major consideration for Filipino consumers.                       Middle class consumers tend to use convenience stores and small scale supermarkets,                 which represent 43.6% of grocery retail sales. These, as well as upscale supermarkets                 (Family Mart and Rustan's Supermarket Fresh), are often located in urban centers and                 shopping malls and are popular for their selection of imported brands and higher quality                 products.                       Online shopping is undeveloped in the Philippines due to slow internet speed, a lack of                 internet access in rural areas, poor transport infrastructure, and a general mistrust of digital                 payment methods. Ecommerce penetration is not expected to significantly alter Filipino                 shopping habits, where shopping is a very popular pastime and Filipinos tend to use malls to                 congregate (in air conditioning) at stores, restaurants and entertainment venues.","IV. Consumer Trends                      In modern times, powdered milk is usually made by spray drying nonfat skimmed                 milk, whole milk, buttermilk or whey. Powdered milk, also called dried milk, or milk powder, is                  a manufactured dairy product made by evaporating milk to dryness. One purpose of drying                 milk is to preserve it; milk powder has a far longer shelf life than liquid milk and does not                 need to be refrigerated, due to its low moisture content. Indeed the Philippines seems to be                 fertile ground for all Nestlé products and not just for Bearbrand powdered milk.                      Bearbrand powder milk here in the Philippines they offer variants of powdered milk like                  Bearbrand Powdered Choco, straw berry, mixed Choco and milk and bear brand Ready to                 drink with different pack size and weight. In 2014, a consumer research firm ranked Bear                 Brand milk as No. 6 among the top 50 \"most popular fast-moving consumer goods\" in the                 Philippines. Bearbrand has many competitors here in the Philippines like Alaska, Arla,                 Anchor. Birch Tree. Milk Magic and Nido.                       Other products of nestle evolve into twin pack like in Nescafe and cafe blanca that is                 usually offered at a discount price that is less than the price of the two containers combined                  but more than the price of a single container in order to become accessible in the market                 and lessen the expenses of consumers .Today’s trend are offering of various of flavors so                 not only Bearbrand are the leading milk brand that offered milk products but almost all                 powder milk brands. Whereas, in LAMEA, the milk powder market continues to grow quickly                 due to changes in consumer work and lifestyles, which as a result has encouraged people in                 the region to start depending on packaged food item. Moreover, increase in consumption of                  infant formulas has added to the demand for milk powder in the region. Since packaging is                 one of the largest industries in the entire world, they were one of the first to see                 biodegradable products in general. Unfortunately, only a small section of the packaging                 market adheres to sustainable practices. In just a short decade, the future of packaging has                 begun to change more significantly. Before, eco-friendly and biodegradable packaging","wasn’t seen as something revolutionary or worth a second look, however, it is now inserting                 itself as an essential aspect of every business’ packaging solutions.","SITUATIONAL ANALYSIS                 A.

It is assumed                               that 5.1% of CAGR will be registered during the forecast period. The rising trend of                               cookouts among the younger population has been driving product sales.

CONSUMER TRENDS","According to Moran (2019) Filipino diners where asked about their current                               favorite choice of food has been samgyeopsal, sometimes shortened to “samgyup.”                               Samgyeopsal continues to become on the top lists of local food trends in long term                               already.                                      The adoption of electric grills witnessed a surge on account of the rising                               preference of consumers for grilling meals at home. It is more feasible as it does not                               incur the need for checking the temperature, usage of charcoal, and dealing with                               smoke. Moreover, the advantage of convenience and indoor utility of these products                               have an upper stake in the market. Electric grills rely on electricity as a source of fuel                               for heating surface and grill plate which provides an added advantage of the                               restriction of charcoal and gas grill with respect to apartment barbecuing. Thus,                               indoor   usage    beyond     smoke     will  promote     product    demand.

The total amount of solar energy                               incident on Earth is vastly in excess of the world’s current and anticipated energy                               requirements. If suitably harnessed, this highly diffused source has the potential to                               satisfy all future energy needs. In the 21st century solar energy is expected to                               become increasingly attractive as a renewable energy source because of its                               inexhaustible supply and its nonpolluting character, in stark contrast to the finite                               fossil fuels coal, petroleum, and natural gas.

CONSUMER PROFILE                                Grilling is one of summer’s many great pleasures, playing an important role in                           countless backyard get-togethers, birthday parties, and family gatherings.

There isn’t much about the barbecue grill until the late 1940s, during this time,                           many backyards became filled with grills. However, these mass-produced                            appliances were commonly known for burning the meat and creating a large                           amount of ash. The concept was refined in 1952 by a welder named George                           Stephen. He cut metal to make dome-shaped grills, using the top half as a lid to                            seal in the flavor and help distribute heat more evenly. He then added vents so                           that the fire wouldn’t smother. This design is what many people think of when                            they think about barbecue grills today, as many modern models are based on this                           model.                                 The next evolution in the basic grill (Gas grill) came in the 1960s when there                           was a push to get people to buy more natural gas. Melton Lancaster and William                           G. Wepfer, from the Arkansas Louisiana Gas Company, created a new type of                            grill that ran on propane. This increased the price of grilling; however, these","appliances were often easier to use and thus they boomed in popularity, replacing                           some of the older models.

COMPANY BACKGROUND                            History of Grilling                                The beginning of grilling can be traced back to the 17th century when you                           look at the Arawak tribe of the Caribbean and South America. These people used                           sticks to create a flame over a fire and place the meat on it. They called this                            method of cooking Barbacoa. This idea was adopted by conquerors from Spain,                           who evolved it until the 18th century when people in southeastern America took                           up the idea. Pigs spent hours roasting over a fire, and various sauces and                            different types of wood were used to give different flavors to the meat.                               In 1897, Ellsworth B. A. Zwoyer was the first to patent a design for charcoal                            briquettes, although his thunder was somewhat stolen by the Kingsford company,                           who many associate with grilling. This company was created by Henry Ford, and                           he used wood scraps and sawdust that he got from the assembly lines of his cars                            to create the charcoal.
