A University (or full) and a College (or partial) scholarships shall                           be  valid  only  for  one  semester,  but  shall  be  renewable  for  the                           succeeding semester if the student meets the conditions prescribed.                                   Scholarships in the high school shall be governed by separate                           rules  and  regulations  promulgated  by  the  University  subject  to  the                           approval by the Board of Regents                    Section 3.  Suspension of Classes                                a) Authority  to  Suspend  Classes.  The  University  President                                  has   the  final  authority  to  suspend  classes  throughout                                  the  University  including  all  units  or  branches,  or  he  may                                  suspend  classes  in  specific  units  or  campuses  for  specified                                  periods of time. Suspension of classes does not   mean                 that                                  faculty and employees will not report for duty.                                           The suspension, dismissal or postponement of classes in                                  any   academic  unit  by  the  dean  concerned  should  have                                  previous       authority  from  the  President  except  in  emergency                                  cases when  the  dean  or  campus  administrator  immediately                                  issue  an  order  for  the  suspension  of  classes  after  which  he                                  shall  make  a  report  to  the  President  on  the  circumstances                                  which compelled such   action.                               b) Bases  of  Suspension  of  Classes.  Classes  are  suspended                                  primarily  to  assure  the  safety  of  students  upon  the  advent,                                  usually  unexpected  calamities,  and  forces  of  nature  such  as                                  typhoons, earthquakes and tsunamis.                                             With  respect  to  typhoons,  classes  will  be  suspended                                  upon  advice  of  the  Philippine  Atmospheric  Geophysical  and                                  Astronomical  Services  Authority  (PAG-ASA)  whenever  the                                  typhoon is of sufficient   intensity  to  make  it  advisable  to                                  suspend classes in the   elementary  grade  and  moreover  when                                  the  approach  of  the  typhoon  becomes  more  definitely                                  pronounced  as  to  require  suspension  of  classes  in  the  high                                  school and collegiate levels as  well.  Aside  from  such  official                                  announcements  to  be  made,  classes  may  be  considered                                  automatically suspended in the elementary grades when reports                                  throughout  the  mass  media  confirm  the  raising  of  Typhoon                                  Signal  No.2,  the  suspension  to  apply  furthermore  to  all  high                                  school and collegiate levels if typhoon signal is raised to                                  Typhoon Signal No. 3.                                                                                                               83","CvSU MANUAL OF OPERATIONS                    ________________________________________________________________________  84                                            The  University  President  may  likewise  automatically                                  suspend  classes  even  if  the  Typhoon  Signal  is  below  3  but  is                                  accompanied  by  unabated  torrential  rains  resulting  to  heavy                                  floods and/or landslides.                                           With  respect  to  earthquakes,  those  of  serious  intensity                                  require immediate suspension of classes to enable an inspection                                  of  the  building  and  premises  where  classes  are  being  held.  A                                  general rule to follow upon announcement of PAG-ASA is that                                  the intensity of the tremor is at least Intensity V to allow a 24-                                  hour period from time of the earthquake as the duration of the                                  suspension of classes.                                           Other     force    majeure      and     fortuitous     events     or                                  circumstances  which  may  compel  immediate  suspension  of                                  classes  are  fires,  epidemics  and  bomb  threats  which  will  be                                  dealt with accordingly as the occasion arise.                                           Classes  are  also  suspended  for  short  periods  of  time  to                                  enable  students  to  attend  University  convocations  or  special                                  gathering.  However,  these  are  pre-scheduled  events  for  which                                  announcements are circulated in advance.                                           In  the  absence  of  the  University  President,  the  person                                  next in rank in the hierarchy of command succession adopted                                  by the University shall decide on the suspension of classes.

In  addition  to  the  CHED                                          requirements,  the  number  of  courses  in  revised  or                                          proposed  program  should  conform  to  the  course                                          numbering system being adopted by the University.                                    g)    Phase  Out  Program.  A  phase-out  program  should  be                                          anticipated  in  the  implementation  of  new  or  revised                                          programs                                          If  the  new  program  is  designed  to  replace  an  existing                                  curriculum, the implementation should start from the incoming                                  freshmen  only  and  the  old  curriculum  should  end  with  the                                  graduation of the current students taking it.                                          In  the  revised  courses,  the  compulsory  requirement  for                                  students for the introduced/revised courses should start only in                                  the  current  year  they  are  supposed  to  take  the  course.  In  no                                  case shall the introduced/revised courses be required as back                                  subjects for students.                                   h)      Schedule of Revision/Introduction of New Courses.                                          Unless the revision or introduction of new required course                                  is  a  mandatory  requirement  by  CHED,  no  revision  on  any                                  curriculum of the University shall be made within five (5) years                                  of its implementation.                    Section 5.   Program  Accreditation.  The  University  shall  as  much  as                               possible, submit all programs for accreditation particularly by the                               Accrediting  of  Chartered  Colleges  and  Universities  in  the                               Philippines  (AACCUP)  or  any  accrediting  agency  prescribed  by                               CHED  and  the  Philippine  Association  of  State  Universities  and                               Colleges (PASUC).                                  Relevant to this, the University President shall form a   local                               University-wide  accrediting  body  to  be  headed  by  the  Director  for                               Quality Assurance and Accreditation. It is the duty of this body to                               prepare  for  the  accreditation  of  programs,  including  review  and                               inspection of documents (local         accreditation)       and      schedule                               accreditation visits.                                                                                                              86","CvSU MANUAL OF OPERATIONS                    ________________________________________________________________________  87                                    The  University  may  tap  the  services  of  other  accrediting                               institutions or other outside agencies.                    Section 6.  Scheduling and Conduct of Classes.                            a)     Course Scheduling. These guidelines pertain to tertiary                                  level in the University. SELSHS follows a different set                                  schedule.                                           The  Office  of  the  University  Registrar  is  tasked  to                                  policy     and      oversight      to     course      scheduling.       The                                  College/Department is   furnished  a  tentative  schedule  of                                  courses  two  months  before  each  term,  which  will  be  used  to                                  decide  faculty  assignment.  The  Department  Head,  through                                  the  Dean/Director,  coordinates  with  the  Office  of  the                                  University     Registrar     on    matters      concerning      the    final                                  scheduling  of  courses  as  well  as  room  assignment.  Faculty                                  schedules  are  prepared  by  the  Department  Head  after  due                                  consultations  with  the  faculty  members.  The  assignment  of                                  loads should be based on the existing policies of the institution                                  governing faculty loads. A tentative schedule is usually given to                                  faculty members at least two (2) weeks before the opening of the                                  semester  to  give  them  enough  time  to  prepare.  Loads  are                                  considered  final  once approved  by  the  Dean  and  submitted  to                                  the  Office  of  the  Vice  President  for  Academic  Affairs.  The                                  Department  Head  and  Dean  of  the  College  sign  the  official                                  Report on Load of the faculty before it is forwarded to the Office                                  of the University President.                           b)     Change of Class Schedule. The regular schedule of classes, as                                  approved  by  the  Department  Head  and  the  Dean,  should  be                                  observed strictly. Faculty members should conduct their classes                                  for  instruction  or  consultation  purposes  on  schedule.  Faculty                                  members  should  first  inform,  consult  and  get  the  approval  of                                  their department head and dean should there be changes in the                                  schedule. Internal arrangements between faculty members and                                  students  are  not  allowed.  Any  deviation  from  the  approved                                  schedule  should  be  communicated  to  the  Office  of  the                                  University Registrar.                           c.) Class Size. A minimum number of students are required to open a                                      class:                                                    Undergraduate                  — forty (40) students                                                   Specialization/Majorship — fifteen (15) students                                                    Masters                        — ten (10) students                                                   Doctoral                       — eight (8) students                                                                                                              87","CvSU MANUAL OF OPERATIONS                    ________________________________________________________________________  88                                                     Special class- below           --  ten (10) students;                                     Should  the  class  size  fall  below  the  minimum  number,  the                               Department  Head  should  be  informed  immediately  to  decide                               whether  to  dissolve  the  class  or  to  maintain  it  as  a  special  class                               approved by the Dean of the College. Should the class be dissolved,                               faculty  members  should  advise  the  student  to  transfer  to  other                               classes.                           d)   First  Day  of  Classes.  During  the  first  day  of  classes,  faculty                               members should sign the registration forms of their students and                               collect their class cards or registration forms. The class cards serve                               as evidence that the students are officially enrolled in the class.                                          A  student  is  considered  officially  enrolled  only  after  the                                          following steps are satisfied:                                          University Registrar has duly certified the enrollment on                                          the registration cards.                                          University Cashier has stamped on the required forms an                                          acknowledgement of payment of fees, and                                          Professors/instructors  have  placed  their  initials  or                                          signatures on the registration cards.                                      The  class  list,  issued  by  the  Office  of  the  University                               Registrar, provides the name of the students, regular or irregular,                               officially  enrolled  in  a  course.  Faculty  members  should  get  their                               class lists from their Department Head on the first day of classes.                                          Moreover,  faculty  members  should  orient  the  students                               about the objectives, contents and requirements of the course, and                               explain  the  bases  for  evaluating  students’  performance.  It  is                               recommended  that  the  students  be  provided  with  a  copy  of  the                               course syllabus.                            e) Class Meetings and Dismissal of Classes. Punctuality should  be                               observed at all times in the conduct of classes. If the class should                               start at 7 a.m., the faculty should be in the classroom at exactly                                7 a.m. Classes should be dismissed at least five (5) minutes before                               the end of each period to allow students to move and transfer to                               their next class.                            f) Make-Up Classes. Faculty members who miss their classes due to                               official  functions  should  conduct  make-up  activities/classes.                               Make-up  activities/classes  should  be  for  both  extra  and  regular                               teaching  assignments.  Request  forms  for  make-up  classes  are                               available at the Dean’s Office.                                                                                                             88","CvSU MANUAL OF OPERATIONS                    ________________________________________________________________________  89                      Section 7.   Examinations and Quizzes                                   a) Schedule of Examinations. The schedule for the mid-term                                          and  final  examination  is  prepared  by  the  Office  of  the                                          University  Registrar  and  approved  by  the  Office  of  the                                          Vice-  President  for  Academic  Affairs.  Faculty  members                                          should  administer  their  midterm  and  final  examinations                                          following  this  schedule.  Any  deviation  should  be                                          communicated to the Department Head.                                   b.)     Reporting  Cases  of  Cheating  and  Other  Forms  of                                          Dishonesty.  Any  form  of  dishonesty  and/or  deceit,                                          especially   cheating  during  recitation,  examination  or                                          any class work,   shall be subject to penalty ranging from                                          reprimand to suspension for a year or the remainder   of                                          the school year.

For  graduating  students,  however,                        their grading sheets should be submitted ahead of the schedule for the                        non-graduating students. The dates for submission of grading sheets are                        posted on the school calendar.                             A clear copy of the class records and the report on ratings should also                    be submitted and filed at the Department for reference in cases of inquiries                    regarding computations and incomplete grades.                    Section 9. Changes in Grades. A change of grade is valid only if the faculty                        member has erroneously entered a grade on the grading sheet or made                        an  error  in  the  computation.  The  request  is  officially  made  by  the                        concerned  faculty  and  noted  by  the  Department  Head  and  the  Dean                        before it is forwarded to the Registrar.

While  in  college/campus,                                 many  students  experience  personal  difficulties  that  can  be                                 exacerbated by the  challenges  of  maturation,  an  unfamiliar                                 environment,  and  academic  pressure  or  stiff  competition.  Some                                 students resolve their difficulties  over time on their own, a few,                                 however, are able to do so only with professional help.                                     Guidance  and  counseling  services  are  available  for  all                                 students at the OSA. Such services can involve the assessment of                                 students’ difficulties in their studies, through appropriate testing                                 and assessment mechanisms, for the individual student to realize                                 his /her full potential.                                   Faculty  members  are,  therefore,  encouraged  to  refer  students                                 who have problems to the Office of Student Affairs (OSA).
