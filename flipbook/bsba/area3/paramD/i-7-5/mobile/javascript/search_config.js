Branding is marketing strategy that              will catch the attention of the consumer and give them the right information for them to have a better              perception. Brand perception is the sum of feelings a consumer has about the brand. These thoughts              and feeling happen when a consumer is aware of the brand and what follows when that consumer hears              sees or interacts with the brand and its product.                  Videos on Perception and Culture               Cultural symbolism is an important aspect of perception. This video tells us how culture was linked in              market. a specific target segment based on certain symbolic characteristics that are relevant to that              culture.  marketer must have to study about the local culture in-depth before offering a product to              them. Because of every marketing promotion has done to promote the product. communicating              product feature to the customers and influence customers to buy it. It gives us idea about the power of              perception especially in backdrop of a cultural context and how the change of cultural context had              mattered to the target segment of the particular brand/                  Videos on Sensation and Attention               There are two aspects which are important the sensation and attention. Sensation is the immediate              and direct response of the sensory organs to stimuli. A stimulus may be any unit of input to any of              these senses. Sensory receptors are the human organs that receive sensory inputs. Their sensory              functions are to see, hear, smell, taste and feel. All of these functions are called into play, either singly              or in combinations, in the evaluation and use of most consumer products. Attention always precedes              perception. Attention is the central process and perception is not at all possible without attention. The              process of attention serves the various functions in the organization of our perception and other              cognitive functions. The senses also form an input, and hence an important aspect from the viewpoint              of branding.","Videos on Application of Perception                 Perception Implantation of JND management of productive JND management are developing more              products using target segment with different concept and using a market tragedy based on identifying              subgroups within the target audience in order to deliver more tailored messaging for stronger              connections.

These can be used to differentiate a brand from              similar products or services, giving it a competitive advantage.              The intrinsic attributes are related to the physical aspects of a product (e.g. color, flavor, form and              appearance); on the other hand, extrinsic attributes are related to the product, but not in the physical              part of this one (e.g. brand name, stamp of quality, price, country of origin, store, and packaging.
