The implementation of Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ)                in various regions in the country poses issues and challenges among HEIs wherein faculty,                students and administrators need to face.  Classes in all levels were suspended – face-to-face                teaching  and  learning  stopped  including  all  other  online  learning  activities  since  not  all                students  and  faculty  had  reliable  internet  connection  at  home.  Temporary  closure  affects                40,819 students, 1508 teaching and 590 non-teaching staff of Cavite State University.                         In  response  to  the  threats of  this  global  COVID-19 pandemic,  the  Commission on                Higher  Education  (CHEd) has  recommended  the  implementation  of  a  flexible  system  for                the reopening    of   classes   of   colleges   and   universities   in   the   country   for                school year 2020-2021 (Manila Times, 05 May 2020). CHED Chairperson De Vera explained                that  “under  a  flexible  learning  system, schools  adjust  the  learning  process  based  on  the                location of the students and the structure of the learning system. It includes online and offline                activities.”                         Given the unprecedented challenges of this global pandemic to HEIs,  Cavite State                University has quite significantly initiated plans to reshape the learning management system                that will address the needs and situations of its thousands of students ensuring the highest                degree possible of inclusion and equity in education.                          The following outlines the post ECQ plan of Academic Affairs for the undergraduate                and  graduate  students  in  the  Main  and  Satellite  Campuses  using  the  flexible  learning                arrangement to be implemented effective upon approval:                                          FLEXIBLE LEARNING ARRANGEMENT                         Cavite State University shall implement the  Flexible learning arrangement which                will permit the 1) redesigning of the syllabi to fit to the alternative modes of learning, 2)                the  use  of  both  digital  and  non-digital  modes  of  teaching  and  learning  and  3)                adjustment  on  the  schedules  for  flexible  learning.  This  learning  system  will  provide                learners  with  choices  about  when,  where  and  how  learning  occurs  using  a  range  of                technologies and available materials to support the teaching and learning process.                _____________________________                  * Prepared  by  the  Office  of  the  Vice  President  for  Academic  Affairs  and  approved  by  virtue  of                Administrative Council Resolution No. 13, series of 2020 dated May 10, 2020                                                          Page 1 of 9","Republic of the Philippines                                             CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY                                          Don Severino de las Alas Campus                                                      Indang, Cavite                                                    www.cvsu.edu.ph                         II.

Section 6.  Scheduling and Conduct of Classes.                            a)     Course Scheduling. These guidelines pertain to tertiary                                  level in the University. SELSHS follows a different set                                  schedule.                                           The  Office  of  the  University  Registrar  is  tasked  to                                  policy     and      oversight      to     course      scheduling.       The                                  College/Department is   furnished  a  tentative  schedule  of                                  courses  two  months  before  each  term,  which  will  be  used  to                                  decide  faculty  assignment.  The  Department  Head,  through                                  the  Dean/Director,  coordinates  with  the  Office  of  the                                  University     Registrar     on    matters      concerning      the    final                                  scheduling  of  courses  as  well  as  room  assignment.  Faculty                                  schedules  are  prepared  by  the  Department  Head  after  due                                  consultations  with  the  faculty  members.  The  assignment  of                                  loads should be based on the existing policies of the institution                                  governing faculty loads. A tentative schedule is usually given to                                  faculty members at least two (2) weeks before the opening of the                                  semester  to  give  them  enough  time  to  prepare.  Loads  are                                  considered  final  once approved  by  the  Dean  and  submitted  to                                  the  Office  of  the  Vice  President  for  Academic  Affairs.  The                                  Department  Head  and  Dean  of  the  College  sign  the  official                                  Report on Load of the faculty before it is forwarded to the Office                                  of the University President.                           b)     Change of Class Schedule. The regular schedule of classes, as                                  approved  by  the  Department  Head  and  the  Dean,  should  be                                  observed strictly. Faculty members should conduct their classes                                  for  instruction  or  consultation  purposes  on  schedule.  Faculty                                  members  should  first  inform,  consult  and  get  the  approval  of                                  their department head and dean should there be changes in the                                  schedule. Internal arrangements between faculty members and                                  students  are  not  allowed.
