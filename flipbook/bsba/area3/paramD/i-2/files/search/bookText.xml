               to be the grand winner with this she received a 500 pesos worth of E-load and a certificate of

                       #FAMEShares: FAMESKONG HANDOG 2021

                       This year the FAME Society continued the yearly Christmas caroling that became a

               custom for the organization. With the pandemic still going on, the organization decided to
               continue the virtual caroling like what they've done last year. Together with the officers, they

               serenade the netizens with the song from the abs-cbn  station’s christmas ID entitled “Andito
               tayo para sa isa’t isa”. All the proceeds of this activity funded the FAMESKONG HANDOG
               Bayong containing Christmas goodies. These bayongs were given to chosen families residing

               from Brgy. Bagtas, Tanza, Cavite.



                   ●  PJMA: Juan Big Idea Nationwide 2022 “The Great Reset of Innovative Trends in
                       the New Millennium”

               As part and member school of the organization Philippine Junior Marketing Association, the
               FAME Society was invited to their annual event called JUAN BIG IDEA NATIONWIDE 2022.
               This  year  the  theme  of  the  event  was  The  Great  Reset  of  Innovative  Trends  in  the  New

               Millennium, in which they invited different kinds of people that are well-known and skilled in
               the business industry.  By this the students who joined this event can be inspired and learned

               about the topics discussed. One of the guest speaker Mr. Marvin Lim from Mega Global talks]]></page><page Index="13"><![CDATA[about how their company bounced back from this pandemic. He talked about their company’s
               core  value  which  is  the  “malasakit”.  This  year  the  organization  has  also  accomplished  a

               milestone as a part of this national organization, because FAME Society is one of partners in
               the success of the Juan Big Idea Nationwide 2022, and received special thanks and Certificate

                   ●  “FAME-Uno” FAME Top Student of the 1st Semester

                       This  semester  the  FAME  Society  acknowledged  all  the  outstanding  Business

               Management students of the CvSU Tanza Campus. That’s why the officers came up with the
               idea  of  giving  a  small  token  and  recognition  for  all  of  the  academic  achievers  of  the  first

               semester. By this the organization posted all the names of the achievers in the facebook page,
               together with the top 1 student of the department. Who is Ms. Alyssa Marie B. Olete, a first
               year student that gained a GPA of 1.00. She received a 1 month premium subscription to an

               entertainment site from the FAME Society. The other top student per year also received a
               small gift from the organization.
