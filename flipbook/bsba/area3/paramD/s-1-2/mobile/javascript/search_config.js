Section 6.  Scheduling and Conduct of Classes.                            a)     Course Scheduling. These guidelines pertain to tertiary                                  level in the University. SELSHS follows a different set                                  schedule.                                           The  Office  of  the  University  Registrar  is  tasked  to                                  policy     and      oversight      to     course      scheduling.       The                                  College/Department is   furnished  a  tentative  schedule  of                                  courses  two  months  before  each  term,  which  will  be  used  to                                  decide  faculty  assignment.  The  Department  Head,  through                                  the  Dean/Director,  coordinates  with  the  Office  of  the                                  University     Registrar     on    matters      concerning      the    final                                  scheduling  of  courses  as  well  as  room  assignment.  Faculty                                  schedules  are  prepared  by  the  Department  Head  after  due                                  consultations  with  the  faculty  members.  The  assignment  of                                  loads should be based on the existing policies of the institution                                  governing faculty loads. A tentative schedule is usually given to                                  faculty members at least two (2) weeks before the opening of the                                  semester  to  give  them  enough  time  to  prepare.  Loads  are                                  considered  final  once approved  by  the  Dean  and  submitted  to                                  the  Office  of  the  Vice  President  for  Academic  Affairs.  The                                  Department  Head  and  Dean  of  the  College  sign  the  official                                  Report on Load of the faculty before it is forwarded to the Office                                  of the University President.                           b)     Change of Class Schedule. The regular schedule of classes, as                                  approved  by  the  Department  Head  and  the  Dean,  should  be                                  observed strictly. Faculty members should conduct their classes                                  for  instruction  or  consultation  purposes  on  schedule.  Faculty                                  members  should  first  inform,  consult  and  get  the  approval  of                                  their department head and dean should there be changes in the                                  schedule. Internal arrangements between faculty members and                                  students  are  not  allowed.  Any  deviation  from  the  approved                                  schedule  should  be  communicated  to  the  Office  of  the                                  University Registrar.                           c.)
