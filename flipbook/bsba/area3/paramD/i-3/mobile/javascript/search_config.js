Nicholson  Santos  and  Henry  Ngo  founded  it.  It  sells  discounted  gadgets,                  computer parts and accessories, and electronic appliances at over 350 locations in the                 Philippines and over 500 locations around the world. CD-R King is a retail chain that                  does  not  manufacture  its  own  products,  instead  purchasing  them  from  a  variety  of                 suppliers in Taiwan, China, and other countries. Years ago, CD-R King was one of the                  best places to go, and it was well-known in the market because it was the first choice of                 all consumers looking for low-cost electronic products. However, despite of being in the                  peak of success CD-R King gradually closing its doors as a result of almost leaving the                 market or, is it appears to be a relic of a bygone era? So, what’s actually happened to                  CD-R King, its status and reason to its downfall?                          Through searching information about the dramatic decline of CD-R King, I found                  so  many  reasons  and  issues  that  the  company  is  dealing  with.  The  first  issue  was                 because  of  poor  quality  of  product.  Despite  the  fact  that  CD-R  King  products  are                  inexpensive,  many  customers  complain  about  the  quality  of  CD-R  King  products,                 accusing  them  of  selling  low-quality  items  that  easily  break  or  fall  apart.  As  a  result,                  consumers  have  grown  tired  of  purchasing  low-cost  goods  due  to  their  poor  quality.                 They prefer to pay a higher price product that will last a long time rather than a cheaper                 product. According to Narayanan Janakiraman, UTA assistant professor of marketing in                  the  College  of  Business  said  that  consumers  equate  lower  prices  with  lower  quality,                 that’s  why  even  new  customer  wouldn’t  want  to  buy  or  if  ever  they  prefer  cheaper                  product that can suit to their budget  they can buy it through their nearby  stores or in                 online  stores,  less  effort.  There’s  a  theory  that  one  of  the  reason  why  CD-R  King  is","collapsing is because of the rise of e-commerce. Lazada, Shopee also offering cheap                 products  like  CD-R  King,  however  the  blame  was  not  on  the  company  since  they                  already take an interest to the e-commerce, but the review or feedback of the customer                 was low, that’s why customer don’t want to buy. Then last issue was because of poor                  performance  or  customer  service.  CD-R  King  didn’t  change  at  all,  even  the  time                 consuming payment system of the company. Handwritten receipts of their salesperson                  makes customer wait for a long time.                          Setting  prices  in  a  retailer's  store  requires  various  approaches  depending  on                  whether the company's goal is long-term or short-term. However, in  general, in  order                 for the retailer to  make profit  from  selling  an  item,  the  retailer's  price  must  include  the                  item's cost as well as the added percent markup. In my analysis, the pricing strategy of                 CD-R King is competitive pricing. CD-R King setting their item’s price in lower rate and                  because of the cheaper price, customer patronize CD-R Kings product the reason why                 they  were  successful  in  the  past.  And  I  think  their  pricing  strategy  is  appropriate  for                  them, given the number of competitors who offer the same product. I don’t think that the                 problem of CD-R King is their pricing strategy. Based on the information mention above,                  the  main  problem  of  CD-R  King  is  the  quality  of  their  product.  Customer  always                 complains about the quality of their product. They already had a bad reputation, in the                 minds of the consumer whenever they heard CD-R King the first thing will come up to                  their minds is low quality products in lower prizes.","Jean Brunette F. Henares                 BSBM 3-4                                             Case Analysis for the CD-R King                                The  CD-R  King  was  a  Filipino  retail  business  that  offered  low-cost  computer                 components and supplies, as well as electronic appliances and accessories. CD-R King                  stores were frequently found in shopping malls, competing with higher-end electronics                 companies. They have about 500 branches scattered all across the country. In addition                  to optical storage media, they offered cellular phones, electronic gadgets, accessories,                 appliances, electric bicycles, and even health and beauty products. However, the CD-R                 King has faced difficulties during its development and expansion. In 2008, the Optical                  Media Board accused CD-R King of facilitating copyright infringement through low-cost                 media supplied by the company, imposing a PHP 1.5 million fine for failing to submit                  permits for specific optical media disc importation. The company's construction quality                 earned  them  a  questionable  reputation,  with  some  items  breaking  down  soon  after                  purchase. Globe Telecom signed agreements with various major merchants of electronics                 and IT equipment, including CD-R King, in 2013 to minimize the sale of illegal repeaters,                  or  signal  boosters,  in  the  Philippines.  The  agreement  forbids  merchants  from  selling                 signal  boosters  that  do  not  meet  the  standards  of  the  National  Telecommunications                  Commission.                             The general marketing approach of CD-R King emphasizes the relatively low cost                 and  affordability  of  products.  Whereas  CD-R  King  provides  computer  parts  at  a","reasonable  cost,  they  are  popular  even  without  promotion  due  to  their  low  cost-                 effectiveness. The CD-R King's pricing strategy is known as \"economy pricing,\" and it                  implies that they keep their product prices lower than competitors since Filipinos are price                 sensitive. As a result of its pricing strategy back then, CD-R King has grown to become                  the biggest and largest computer retailer in the Philippines.                             From my perspective, I believe that CD-R King's current dilemma arises from the                  poor quality of the goods they provide rather than its pricing strategy. When it comes to                 pricing, the CD-R King product offering is definitely more affordable for most customers,                 but the quality of the materials utilized to create their products is indeed very unstable. As                  a  result,  people's  preferences  have  shifted  to  purchasing  computer  components  that                 are both acceptable in terms of quality and affordability.","Republic of the Philippines                                         CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY                                                      Tanza Campus                                                  Bagtas, Tanza, Cavite                                                        (046) 414 – 3979                                                     www.cvsu.edu.ph                                             DEPARTMENT OF MANAGEMENT                                                  ONLINE PORTFOLIO                                           MKTG 106: International Marketing                                            Second Semester, AY 2021-2022                  Name of Student: JENNICA BANTACULO                Course/Year/Section: BSBM 3-1                   TITLE OF ACTIVITY                 DATE           ACCOMPLISHED/               GRADE                                                SUBMITTED            SUBMITTED           International Marketing Plan        March 12, 2022           Part I                                                          /                     84           Case Study 1                        March 14, 2022              /                     83           International Marketing Plan        March 28, 2022           Part II                                                         /                     84           Case Study 2                        March 30, 2022              /                     87           Midterm Examination                  April 9, 2022              /                     84           International Marketing Plan           Part III-IV                          May 16, 2022               /                     81           Final Requirement:                  June 16, 2022               /                     85           International Marketing Plan           Final Requirement:                  June 16, 2022               /                     86           International Advertisement                   Checked by:                  RITCH M.
