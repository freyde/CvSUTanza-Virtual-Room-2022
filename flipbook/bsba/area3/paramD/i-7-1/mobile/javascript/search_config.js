Special discounts, allowances,                slotting fees, coupons, payments for displays, and similar tactics were used abundantly to get                 retailers  and  wholesalers  to  push  their  products.  The  main  problem  with  that  approach  to                motivating channel members is that it can be very expensive for the manufacturer. It often requires                 higher costs for special packaging and handling, creates “peak and valleys” in production, and                increases the manufacturer’s promotional costs. Moreover, from the consumer’s point of view, the                ups and down in prices, when one week a box of Tide might sell for $3.79 (Php184.04) and the                 next  week  for  $7.79  (Php378.29),  fosters  price  sensitivity  and  erodes  brand  loyalty.  In  a                fundamental  break  with  this  status  quo  approach  to  channel  management,  P\&G  offered  its                 products to channel members at lower prices on an everyday and sustained basis. P\&G believed                this  would  reduce  its  own  costs  and  enable  channel  members  to  pass  on  lower  prices  to                consumers, also on an everyday basis.                         What  do  you  think  of  P\&G’s  channel  strategy?  What  are  its  possible  strengths  and                weaknesses? Discuss from the standpoints of the manufacturer and the channel members.                  Answer:                Their strategy are good for their company to increase the sale.                The weakness here is that they offer special deals merchandising campaigns to mainstay their                 channel, which is good hopefully. Case in point,  the cost is huge. Yes, they are using those tactics                to get more resellers and to push their products. But the main problem is it can be very expensive                 to the manufacturer.                The  strength  of  this  company  are  when  they  use  the  “peak  and  valleys”  the  manufacturer                increased promotional costs. And P\&G offer their product to channel members at lower prices on                 an everyday sustained basis. P\&G believed that it would reduce at own costs and it will lower the                prices to consumers and in everyday basis. This company became more motivated and learned                 a lot because of their past experiences.","CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY                                  Tanza             Name of Students      : Amistoso, Christian                                 Baraoed, Sheena Mae                                  Dela Pena, Lorie Jane                                 Pecenio, Celestie                                  Reyes, Lorivic                                 Sumalde, Christine Joy            Group                   : One         Year and Section      :  3-2         Instructor            : RITCH M.

But in         the mid-1990s, the near collapse of its supply chain meant Nokia was on the precipice of being a victim of         its success. In response, disciplined systems and processes were put in place, which enabled Nokia to          become extremely efficient and further scale up production and sales much faster than its competitors.                Between 1996 and 2000, the headcount at Nokia Mobile Phones (NMP) increased 150 percent to         27,353, while revenues over the period were up 503 percent. This rapid growth came at a cost. And that          cost was that managers at Nokia’s main development centres found themselves under ever increasing         short-term performance pressure and were unable to dedicate time and resources to innovation.                 While the core business focused on incremental improvements, Nokia’s relatively small data group         took up the innovation mantle. In 1996, it launched the world’s first smartphone, the Communicator, and         was also responsible for Nokia’s first camera phone in 2001 and its second-generation smartphone, the          innovative 7650.         The search for an elusive third leg                 Nokia’s leaders were aware of the importance of finding what they called a “third leg” – a new         growth area to complement the hugely successful mobile phone and network businesses. Their efforts         began in 1995 with the New Venture Board but this failed to gain traction as the core businesses ran their          own venturing activities and executives were too absorbed with managing growth in existing areas to focus         on finding new growth.                                                                                                                 1","CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY                                  Tanza                  A renewed effort to find the third leg was launched with the Nokia Ventures Organization (NVO)         under the leadership of one of Nokia’s top management team. This visionary programme absorbed all         existing ventures and sought out new technologies. It was successful in the sense that it nurtured a number          of critical projects which were transferred to the core businesses. In fact, many opportunities NVO identified         were too far ahead of their time; for instance, NVO correctly identified “the internet of things” and found          opportunities in multimedia health management – a current growth area. But it ultimately failed due to an         inherent contradiction between the long-term nature of its activities and the short-term performance         requirements imposed on it.          The swift decline                The following years marked a period of infighting and strategic stasis that successive         reorganizations did nothing to alleviate. By this stage, Nokia was trapped by a reliance on its unwieldy          operating system called Symbian. While Symbian had given Nokia an early advantage, it was a device-         centric system in what was becoming a platform- and application-centric world. To make matters worse,         Symbian exacerbated delays in new phone launches as whole new sets of code had to be developed and          tested for each phone model. By 2009, Nokia was using 57 different and incompatible versions of its         operating system.                 While Nokia posted some of its best financial results in the late 2000s, the management team was         struggling to find a response to a changing environment: Software was taking precedence over hardware         as the critical competitive feature in the industry. At the same time, the importance of application          ecosystems was becoming apparent, but as dominant industry leader Nokia lacked the skills, and         inclination to engage with this new way of working.                By 2010, the limitations of Symbian had become painfully obvious and it was clear Nokia had          missed the shift toward apps pioneered by Apple. Not only did Nokia’s strategic options seem limited, but         none were particularly attractive. In the mobile phone market, Nokia had become a sitting duck to growing         competitive forces and accelerating market changes. The game was lost, and it was left to a new CEO          Stephen Elop and new Chairman Risto Siilasmaa to draw from the lessons and successfully disengage         Nokia from mobile phones to refocus the company on its other core business, network infrastructure          equipment.                                                                                                                                      2","CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY                                  Tanza                                                           CASE ANALYSIS                                                       Case Study:   Nokia                I.

The products’ value is relatively high.                     2. The relation with customers very poor and of low quality.                                                                                                                   3","CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY                                  Tanza                      3. This makes customers settle for cheaper phones with the same qualities offered by other                        dealers.                       Opportunities                    1. Increased penetration of telecommunications in its markets.                     2. Offering innovative smart phones that offers advanced technological features.                    3.

BANATE, MBA                Week             3-4                       High oil prices are causing pain for carmakers in America as people there are sacrificing their         fancy for pick-up trucks and sport-utility vehicles for more frugal small vehicles. In May 2008, General         Motors announced a 30 percent fall in car sales, compared with a year earlier; Ford posted a 19 percent          drop, and sales of its F-150 pick-up fell behind Toyota’s Camry and Corolla for the first time. But far in         Russia, the high oil price is powering the expansion of the market rather than painful restructuring. Thanks          to abundant natural resources, Russia has been witnessing a rising economy since decade ago. With         nearly doubled and steadily rising real disposable income, cars are no longer unaffordable for many         Russians.                    Currently, car ownership in Russia is still low at about 200 per 1,000 people, compared with the         over 500 in most of Western Europe and the around 800 in American (even in other former communist         countries in Central Europe, the number is between 300 and 350). But the car market there is expanding: in          2007 Russia’s sales of new cars grew 36 percent by volume and 57 percent by value; sales of passenger         vehicles exceeded 2.7million. According to analysts, Russia could outstrip Germany as Europe’s biggest         market by 2008, with sales reaching around 3.3 million; by 2012 Russians will be buying more than 5          million new cars a year, of which nearly 90 percent will be foreign brands.                   However, all of the growth has been met by foreigners. Sales of Russian brands have stayed flat          for the past few years—hovering between 750,000 and 800,000. Early in 2002, a few years before foreign         carmakers’ rushing into Russia, the Russian government slapped a 25 percent duty on imported used cars         when domestic carmakers were struggling with challenges from imported second-hand cars. Unfortunately,          later new imports took their place as the sale of used imports fell. The new rivals took 48 percent of the         market by value in 2005. This time, instead of raising import duties again, Russian government passed a          measure intended to encourage foreign makers to set up local assembly plants so as to revive the Russian         car industries. According to the terms, to qualify for relief from import duty, foreign carmakers have to build         a factory with a capacity of more than 25,000 vehicles a year—a minimum investment of at least $100m.          Within five years of production starting, the local content in each car had to reach 30 percent.                                                                                                                 1","CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY                                  Tanza                     This triggered a scramble by the world’s biggest car firms to build factories in Russia. On the         crowded list are American firms Ford and GM’s Chevrolet, Japan’s Toyota, Suzuki, Nissan, Isuzu, and         Mitsubishi, South Korea’s Kia, Hyundai and Daewoo, and European makers Renault, Volkswagen, Fiat and          BMW. Chinese carmakers like Chery, Great Wall, and SsangYong are also trying to head into Russia.                   Doubtlessly, the foreign carmakers’ rush into Russia is promoting this country’s car industry as          the government expected. Currently, assembly of foreign models alone has attracted significant investment         over $2 billion in the first stage. And investment plans already announced suggest that new capacity could         reach 1.6m units by 2012. However, foreign carmakers’ expansion on the Russian market is at the expense          of Russian ones.                   In 1990 Russian carmakers built 1.2 million passenger vehicles, but in 2007 they sold just         756,000. AvtoVAZ, which makes more than 90 percent of the Russian-brand passenger cars, is still selling          its Ladas in provincial Russia because of its low price, the large number of dealers, and few alternatives         there. Currently, the main threat to Lada comes from very cheap Chinese cars and the possible change in         the used-car business policy. Although so far the likes of Chery and Great Wall from China haven’t          received permissions from the Russian authorities to set up in Russia, such situation may not last long. And         if as expected the 18 percent VAT on used cars sold by dealers is abolished, Lada’s price advantage will          vanish. Now AvtoVAZ’s main hope lies in the 25 percent stake recently acquired by Renault for $1 billion.         Based on         Renault platforms, the largest Russian carmaker is expecting to bring new Ladas to market by 2010.                    Another local producer, Severstal-Auto, has decided to focus on small vans and trucks rather         than taking on foreign car brands due to the potentially large demand from the fast growing retail sectors.         Severstal already has a joint venture with Fiat to produce its Albea and Linea saloons. In May 2008, the          first Fiat Ducato van was successfully driven off the firm’s new production line in Elabuga, a ‘‘free economic         zone’’ in Tatarstan. Severstal also makes small and medium-sized Isuzu trucks. Another possible section of         this company probably will be high-margin services—actually Severstal is as well thinking about building a          dealer network so as to sell services such as adapting vehicles for school and hospitals, providing full-         service leasing arrangements and offering credit terms with local banks.                                                                                                                                         2","CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY                                  Tanza                                                         CASE ANALYSIS          Case Study:           I.

BANATE, MBA                Week              2                       McDonald’s, the world’s largest restaurant chain with over 30,000 outlets in more than 115         countries, brings to mind many terms: golden arches, Big Macs, McNuggets, affordable meals, brand value,         and American capitalism, to name just a few. How did McDonald’s become one of the world’s best-known          brands? Needless to say, being in the food industry entails different menus for different parts of the world         based on varying tastes and preferences. At the time, McDonald’s made its foray into foreign markets it          was almost impossible to have a mass marketing or global strategy in terms of McDonald’s menu items.         Therefore, the company adopted a strategy to appeal to those different preferences. According to the         company, the secret to its successful brand is a type of multidomestic strategy, which the company used          successfully by being able to offer different menus in different countries.                   Previously, McDonald’s even extended this strategy to marketing for its restaurants in foreign         markets. Remember the yellow and red-garbed clown that attracted kids to McDonald’s? McDonald’s had          maintained the same image for years and by the start of the twenty-first century, it was not working         anymore. Additionally, the growing health consciousness among consumers the world over caused the         restaurant chain          to suffer decreasing profitability. Nevertheless, by 2005, the year that marked its fiftieth anniversary,         McDonald’s was on its way to regaining its stardom.                    With time, it is necessary for companies to keep abreast of the changes that are taking place in         the environment. Today, many firms are shifting from a multidomestic or multinational strategy to a more         global one. It is believed that one reason for this is the growing convergence in consumer behavior,          especially         for food and apparel. For example, consumers all over the world are moving toward a healthy lifestyle that          includes a healthy diet and exercise. For firms, a global strategy allows them to minimize overall costs, and         specifically marketing costs, by repeating commercials with few alterations, justifying high advertising         expenditure to release a perfect ad. McDonald’s is one of several companies that have adopted a global                                                                                                                    1","CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY                                  Tanza           marketing strategy. McDonald’s has had to revive its global business over the past five years, one of the         ways to do it being to replace its previous shoddy image with a hip new one.                           In the year 2003, the company launched its first truly global marketing campaign called ‘‘I’m lovin’         it.’’ The new promotion effort aimed at changing the company’s image in markets all over the world sends         the same message to its global consumers with small changes for local tastes and preferences. Thus, even          though there is still a significant divergence in McDonald’s menus, the new global marketing campaign         instilled a distinct global brand value in the minds of consumers. McDonald’s invested heavily in the         campaign, employing celebrities, such as singer Justin Timberlake and popular music group Destiny’s Child          who draw a global audience, to appear in its advertisements. In addition, McDonald’s introduced more         healthy foods in its menus such as salads. The ‘‘I’m lovin it’’ marketing campaign was targeted at         consumers in all age groups from kids and young adults to seniors. The conceptualization of the ad was          also global. It was the brainchild of a Germany-based firm Heye and Partner; the company settled on this         agency after consulting with several marketing agencies in many different countries. The campaign has          been one of the most successful of its time. The strategy worked, and in just one year, the company’s         revenues were up by more than 10 percent. As for the novel marketing drive, the company won Advertising         Age magazine’s Marketer of the Year Award for 2004. As for its recent comeback, McDonald’s is truly lovin’          it.                                                                                                                                                         2","CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY                                  Tanza                                                                CASE ANALYSIS          Case Study:           RESTAURANTS TRY TO SERVE APPETIZING DEALS           I.
