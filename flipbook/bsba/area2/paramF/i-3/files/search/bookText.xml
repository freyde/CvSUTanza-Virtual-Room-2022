          I. DEFINITION OF CONSUMER BEHAVIOR

            Consumer behavior is a rapidly growing discipline of study. It means more than just how a person buys
        products. It is a complex and multidimensional process and reflects the totality of consumers’ decisions with

        respect  to  acquisition,  consumption  and  disposal  activities.  We,  as  consumers,  exhibit  very  significant
        differences in our buying behavior and play an important role in local, national or international economic

        conditions. One of the very few aspects common to all of us is that we are all consumers and the reason for
        a business firm to come into being is the presence of consumers who have unfulfilled, or partially fulfilled
        needs and wants. No matter who we are – urban or rural, male or female, young or old, rich or poor, educated

        or uneducated, believer or non-believer, or whatever – we are all consumers. We consume or use on a
        regular  basis food,  shelter,  clothing,  education, entertainment,  brooms,  toothbrushes,  vehicles,  domestic
        help, healthcare and other services, necessities, comforts, luxuries and even ideas etc. Organizations realize

        that their marketing effectiveness in satisfying consumer needs and wants at a profit depends on a deeper
        understanding  of  consumer  behavior.  Our  consumption  related  behavior  influences  the  development  of
        technology and introduction of new and improved products and services.

            To succeed in a dynamic marketing environment, marketers have an urgent need to learn and anticipate
        whatever  they  can  about  consumers.  The  better  they  know  and  understand  consumers,  the  more
        advantageous it would prove in accomplishing their organizational objectives. Marketers want to know what

        consumers think, what they want, how they work, how they entertain themselves, how they play etc. They
        also  need  to  comprehend  personal  and  group  influences  which  have  a  significant  impact  on  consumer
        decision-making process.


        “Consumer  behavior  refers  to  the  actions  and  decision  processes  of  people  who  purchase  goods  and
        services for personal consumption.”
                                                         James F Engel, Roger D Blackwell and Paul W Miniard,
                                                                  “Consumer Behavior” (Dryden Press, 1990)

        Consumer behavior refers to “the mental and emotional processes and the physical activities of people who
        purchase and use goods and services to satisfy particular needs and wants.”

        “The behavior that consumers display in searching for, purchasing, using, evaluating and disposing of, if
        products and services that they expect will satisfy their needs.”

        Consumer behavior refers to “the mental and emotional processes and the observable behavior of consumers
        during searching, purchasing and post consumption of a product or service.”
                                                                                                         Authors


               How consumers make decisions to spend their available resources such as money, time and effort

        on consumption and use related items is the subject of consumer behavior study. Consumer behavior has
        two aspects: the final purchase activity which is visible to us and the decision process which may involve the
        interplay of a number of complex variables not visible to us. In fact, purchase behavior is the end result of a

        long process of consumer decision making. The study involves what consumers’ buy, why they buy it, how
        they buy it, when they buy it, where they buy it, how frequently they buy it and how they dispose of the product
        after use.



             II. IMPORTANCE OF CONSUMER BEHAVIOR


               There are three basic factors why Consumer Behavior is important. It is necessary to talk about each
        of  these  factors  before  starting  with  certain  basic  principles  associated  with  Consumer  Behavior.  It  is
        important  to  understand  the  impact  of  consumer  behavior  on  marketing  strategies  before  proceeding  to

        consumer behavior concepts.






                                                                                                                2]]></page><page Index="109"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY

               Consumer Behavior as the essence of marketing is synergized with the following directions. The three
        directions or factors are:
        1. The consumer mind itself acts as a direction;

        2. The environmental direction; and

        3. The organizational direction.

               These are the three factors that emphasize the importance of consumer  behavior to marketeers.
        Essentially, the context in which consumer behavior is applied could be different, but the underlying principles

        of Consumer Behavior are the same.
        Consumer Behavior as the Essence of Marketing
               The  first  factor  is  associated  with  consumer  behavior  as  the  essence  of  marketing.  This  factor

        elaborates on how consumer behavior tries to enhance and harness several other subjects associated with
        marketing.
               For example, if we consider retailing management, retailing in a shopping context can never happen

        without consumer behavior. This could be associated with the point of purchase aspects or the impulsivity
        aspects of consumer or the visual merchandising, which is done by a particular retailer; and there could be
        many other aspects as well. This holds good for mundane products which are shopped by the ordinary people

        as well as for luxury products, which are only within the reach of a few consumers or economically on a higher
        plane.

               Let us take the example of advertising management. Almost 50 years back, the concept of brand
        positioning was pioneered by stalwarts Ries and Trout. Brand positioning is associated with the unique image
        created by the offering in the mind of the consumer. When I say offering, it refers to a specific brand. How

        can a brand manager or a marketing manager get into brand positioning without having an idea of Consumer
        Behavior?
               Let us consider yet another aspect of marketing, which is customer relationship management or CRM.

        Essentially, customer relationship is based on the behavioral aspects of human beings. So, CRM is not about
        marketing,  it is not about branding, and it is very much about people. Without understanding Consumer
        Behavior, it is extremely difficult to strategize several aspects of CRM or customer relationship management.

        Let us take online retailing or digitalization. Consumer Behavior is important even for digitalization. Let us
        take the example of Amazon or Flipkart or any other online retailer. The online retailer today talks about Big

        Data, which is associated with analytics and which is associated with Data science. It is only Consumer
        Behavior  that  could  provide  valuable  insights  for  marketeers  of  online  retailing;  to  segment  markets,  to
        customize offering and to connect with consumers in real time.

               So, Consumer Behavior interface is extremely important to any aspect of marketing because it brings
        with it an experiential aspect associated with the experience of consumers which will otherwise be missing.





                                                                                                                3]]></page><page Index="110"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                     Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus

        The Consumer Mindset as Direction
               Why is consumer mindset a direction? This is because the central pillar which several of the other
        directions need to take cues from consumer mindset.

               Brand differentiation can be done on several ways. It can be done with respect to the functional
        attributes. It can be done with respect to the consumers emotions. It can be done with respect to several
        aspects that are concerned with the psychological nature of the consumers. It can be done with respect to

        consumer sense of belongingness to their groups or friends or families. It can be done with respect to the
        sensual or experiential pleasure experienced by the consumers. It can also be done with respect to a solution
        given by a brand, as in the case of painting a house that was initiated by a paint company like Asian Paints.

        There are several ways in which the consumer's mind can be approached by the marketeer. The fundamental
        point to be noted is that given a situation where functional attributes of a product are on an even keel with

        respect  to  other  products  in  the  same  category,  then  it  is  only  the  psychological  aspects  of  Consumer
        Behavior that can bring the kind of differentiation that makes a brand competitive.
               Let  us  discuss  some  examples  with  respect  to  soaps,  mobiles,  watches  and  apparel.  There  are

        several ways in which a brand can get itself differentiated. When we talk about brands which are there in the
        same price band, the differentiation on functional features is almost insignificant in several categories. Even

        if  the  differentiation  is  possibly  obtained  by  a  brand  with  respect  to  its  functional  features,  there  will  be
        competitors  who  are  following  suit.  Besides  the  psychological  aspects  of  differentiation  are  significant
        because  there  is  a  likelihood  of  the  consumer  forming  a  relationship  with  the  brand  just  as  we  form

        relationships with other people.
               Let us take the case of a well-known brand which was launched possibly during the mid-eighties. The
        name is HeroHonda, and the brand differentiation was simple - “Fill it, shut it, forget it”. This proposition

        conveyed  the  effectiveness  of  petrol  consumption  with  respect  to  motorcycle  category.  The  brand  was
        launched at a time where most of the brands were giving almost half the kind of mileage associated with
        HeroHonda. HeroHonda had launched a brand on the functional proposition. The advertising and positioning

        of a brand had created an attitude that ensured that the brand was highly successful. This is an example of
        a brand that created a functional proposition and succeeded.

               In contrast to the Hero Honda, let us consider the positioning of Red Bull. Red Bull is an energy drink
        which is oriented towards young target segment. Red Bull, of course, has more caffeine and it keeps the
        consumer awake, but essentially, the proposition of Red Bull is its association with energy and parties that

        youngsters  indulge  in.  Hence  in  terms  of  functional  proposition,  it  is  subjugated  to  the  psychological
        proposition of belongingness as associated with youngsters and parties and so on. Red Bull symbolizes the

        party going fun related to youngsters, and party going is the in thing with respect to young groups.
               Consumer  Behavior  as  a  direction  taking  into  account  the  mindset  of  the  consumer  also  has  to
        connect with the lifestyles of consumers. Let us take a look at the Indian environment when we consider a

        product like Quaker Oats- it is in line with the lifestyle focusing on fitness and health. It is be noted that food
        is an innate part of the culture, and it is extremely difficult to change the habits of consumers with respect to

                                                                                                                4]]></page><page Index="111"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                     Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus

        food habits in any part of the world. Today, with the culture of fitness and health getting into the awareness
        of urban consumers. Quaker Oats is slowly becoming a routine with respect to the breakfast of several
        consumers in the urban cities.

               Let us take the example of lifestyle connected with online shopping with respect to apparel. Myntra is
        a brand that has made use of the current fashion of online shopping and the concept of one's apparel as a
        reflection  of  once  self  which  is  associated  with  personality.  So,  personalities  another  aspect  of  the

        psychological dimension associated with Consumer Behavior.
               There are several kinds of brands that get associated with the lifestyles of consumers. Nescafe is an
        instant coffee that is into the lifestyle of urban consumers. It is just not positioned on the convenience of

        making coffee. It is positioned on the psychological aspects of making enjoyable moments more enjoyable
        with a cup of Nescafe.

               Consumer Behavior as a mindset also connects with rituals in the consumer's mind. The ritual in
        simple terms is a routine activity of a consumer which is repeated in a fixed sequence over a period of time.
        The purpose of the ritual can either be symbolic or functional. Functional could be with respect to hunger,

        and the symbolic aspect of ritual could be with respect to celebrations.
               Let us take the case of coconut oil. Coconut oil is something that has been used for the ritual of

        grooming hair for the last several decades. Parachute is a brand that has converted the opportunity into
        branding and has launched several sub brands associated with the ritual of grooming. For decades, there
        were hair creams with respect to grooming. Brylcream was one of them. Aftershower was one of the brands

        of parachute that became a success with respect to the younger segment. The timing of Aftershower as a
        part of the bathing ritual, and the delivery of hair care benefit in the form of a cream made it a success.
               So, another point that should be been noted is also the timing associated with launch of a brand.

        Parachute got into the grooming rituals of several other kinds of targets segments. For example, there is a
        cultural practice of applying the oil before bath and the cultural practice is quite traditional in several parts of
        the country. Parachute introduced hot oil that consumers can apply before bath. Parachute also has an herbal

        offering for the grooming rituals of consumers.
        The Environmental Direction

               The next aspect that is in line with the importance of consumer behavior is environmental direction.
        Speaking  of  environmental  direction,  the  entire  world  has  changed  over  the  last  couple  of  decades.
        Essentially,  as  the  environment  changes,  product  proliferation  happens,  brand  proliferation  happens,

        consumer lifestyle changes, and all of them are triggered by environmental factors at a very macro level.
               Environmental  factors  can  be  associated  with  technology.  It  can  be  associated  with  government

        policies. It can be associated with a particular trend with respect to consumers’ fashion and it could also be
        associated with economic recession as well as economic well-being. If we have to take into consideration the
        Phlippine context which is extremely diverse with respect to its consumers and culture, the environmental

        factors play an important role.



                                                                                                                5]]></page><page Index="112"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                     Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus

               Let  us  consider  a  city  like  Manila,  where  there  are  different  kinds  of  consumers  ranging  from
        consumers  who  shop  in  small  shops  to  wealthy  consumers  who  shop  in  an  international  ambiance.  A
        knowledge of consumer behavior is required for the analysis of both these segments.

               Before liberalization, the marketing context in the Philippines was completely different. So, when we
        think of environmental directions, we need to think of the post-liberalization and the pre-liberalization periods
        of time in our country.

               Let us take a look at some of the product categories in India that will tell us more about how the
        environment has changed over a period of time: -
               Currently, India has multinational cars from several advanced countries, and consumers can choose

        from a wide variety of offerings. But before liberalization, there was only Ambassador or Fiat as brands in
        India. Then slowly Maruti started opening up the market before the marketplace was full of different kinds of

        car brands. When we consider motorcycle as a category pre 80s was dominated by two brands Yezdi’s and
        Java. At a later point in time, we had different kinds of brands coming into the Indian scenario to make a
        mark. In fact, even Yezdi and Java have been relaunched again in the present-day context. If you take

        example from the footwear industry, Bata was ruling the roost before the 80s, and today there are a host of
        other brands which are there in the competitive scenario. We can go on and on with the categories to reflect

        how environment has changed over a period of time.
               Technology, of course, is an important part of the environmental direction. And the introduction of
        smartphones  in  the  Indian  context  provides  ample  evidence  about  the  online  surfing  with  respect  to

        smartphones, and customized ads with respect to smartphone users, and several other related aspects. The
        point to be noted is that some of these brands can be identified at the behavioral level of the consumer, and
        that is the reason why Consumer Behavior is extremely important. When it comes to some of these brands,

        it means that the behavioral orientation associated with brands vary depending on the context and depending
        on the brand strategies.
        The Organizational Direction

               With respect to Organizational Direction, Philip Kotler's advocacy on Holistic Marketing is extremely
        important. Philip Kotler, in his basic principles of marketing, has dealt with the holistic concept associated

        with marketing. The holistic concept brings in the customer orientation into an organization. The internal
        marketing aspects of the holistic marketing is a very strong aspect of holistic marketing, and Consumer
        Behavior makes a tremendous contribution to the concept of internal marketing.

               Internal marketing brings together several departments in an organization to ensure the organization
        is customer centric. And Consumer Behavior plays an important role in terms of its integration with holistic

        marketing.
               A typical example of this could be the case of ITC. ITC is a large organization that was manufacturing
        cigarettes. And over a period of time, in order to reduce the dependence on cigarettes, the company has

        branched off into many other categories, and that in fact, is an attempt by the organization to come to grips



                                                                                                                6]]></page><page Index="113"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                     Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus

        with environmental changes. ITC, for example, has moved into commodities, soaps, shampoos, chocolates,
        detergents, diary, and coffee to name a few categories.
               Let  us  consider  another  example  with  respect  to  one  of  the  ITC's  product  Aashirvad  wheat.

        Essentially, wheat is a commodity. A commodity is something which is traded more on the price aspects. A
        brand is supposed to enhance the value of the offering. Aashirvad has not only achieved a higher mark and
        quality, it is able to dispense out different kinds of offerings with respect to different kinds of wheat as preferred

        by specific geographical areas and the respective cultures.
               Several of these aspects would not be possible without Consumer Behavior becoming the core part
        of internal marketing. ITC has also strategically used the holistic aspects with respect to its supply chain. The

        supply chain is something which ITC has been able to streamline with respect to its relationship with several
        farmers over a period of several decades. The point to be noted is that several aspects of holistic marketing

        converge, and the converging point is Consumer Behavior.

               For better understanding, try to watch the videos about the importance of consumer behavior

               through this link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QfzQDrX-grIOOm-

               III. CONSUMER BEHAVIOR FRAMEWORKS

               The foremost important aspect of consumer behavior is that it does not have an identity of its own. It

        is  inter-disciplinary  in  nature  bringing  together  several  aspects  connected  with  Psychology,  Sociology,
        Anthropology, Artificial intelligence, Evolutionary biology, and any other aspect of the mind that can be applied
        with respect to consumers.

               In fact, in the recent times, neuro marketing and physiological aspects of consumer behavior are also
        being investigated. The interdisciplinary nature of consumer behavior is in fact the unique selling proposition

        of consumer behavior. Consumer behavior consists of the individual processes which the consumer as an
        individual puts into action. This is with respect to how he or she feels, thinks and acts.
               The individual processes in the course are discussed in an individual manner, but in terms of the

        working in consumers mind they are all simultaneously working together, and different types of individual
        processes can be attributed to different kinds of context. The individual processes, for example, could be how

        consumers perceive different kinds of things in the environment. It could be associated with how they learn
        about the environment and the brands.
               Attitude is something which is associated with frames of references that consumers have and make

        use of when they get into decision making. For example, what is a quick frame of reference or attitude with
        respect to a set of consumers on a given category, like cars or soaps? What are the criteria they make use

                                                                                                                7]]></page><page Index="114"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                     Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus

        of with respect to brand decision making? What is the attitude with respect to the consumer on sports? What
        is the attitude with respect to religion? There are different facets of life, and with respect to each facet of life
        the consumer develops an attitude. The attitude is associated with beliefs, feelings and behavioral aspects,

        and these are extremely important aspects from the viewpoint of branding.
               Personality is another individual process. Personality is strongly connected with the motivation for the
        individual. How a consumer’s personality and motivation influence their marketing goals and the selection of

        brands makes an interesting contribution to consumer behavior.
               Another important aspect of Consumer Behavior is a manner in which the consumer interacts with
        groups of other consumers or their friends or their families. These are all different kinds of groups that exert

        an influence on the consumer's mind, which in turn exerts an influence on their decision making with respect
        to brands. These kinds of groups can be called as “reference groups”.

               “Reference groups” is a concept that has an impact on consumers, their decisions, their thinking and
        attitude, and it is fundamental when it is associated with certain kinds of decision making. In fact, the onset
        of social media has recreated the interest with respect to the concept of reference groups because social

        media is all about sharing. The different ways in which consumers make use of their interaction with reference
        groups through their social media behavior is a topical aspect in the study of Consumer Behavior.

               Another part which is extremely important in consumer behavior is culture. In simple terms, culture is
        “shared learning”. How consumers share their learning and how it gets passed on from one generation to
        another- is the essence of culture. Culture is a combination of beliefs, customs, arts, language, food, and

        everything associated with consumers in a specific social context or culture.
               For example, the Asian culture is very different from the European culture. Even with respect of the
        Asian culture, there could be cultural differences with respect to urban college students and rural college

        students, there are cultural differences between software professionals and other kinds of professionals,
        there could be cultural differences between professors and businesspersons.
               Cultural learning is very specific to a social context. For example, cultural aspects of religion and

        values are important in the Indian context, to the extent that they even influence the choices when it comes
        to  foods.  Drawing  an  example  from  the  marketing  context-  India,  perhaps  is  the  only  country  where

        McDonald's or the McDo doesn’t have a beef offering with respect to the food it serves. This is because the
        brand would like to respect the religious value of Indians.
               Values pervade into every aspect of our life, and cultural values are extremely important from the

        viewpoint of marketing. For example, herbal offerings associated with Ayurveda has a strong cultural root,
        and there could be several kinds of brand beliefs associated with Ayurveda. Today we have companies like

        Unilever, Himalaya and several other brands that market herbal offerings. We talk about green products or
        environmental products, and herbal offering form an important part of the cultural beliefs.
               For example, Santoor soap which is very successful with respect to its foray in the Indian context uses

        turmeric and there are several cultural beliefs associated with turmeric and sandalwood. Sandalwood is also
        used by the some of the variants of Santoor. And these beliefs are concerned with the ability of the herbs to

                                                                                                                8]]></page><page Index="115"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY

        take care of the consumer’s complexion. So, one can notice how the cultural aspects form an inherent part
        of the respective brand position.
               Cultural beliefs associated with mother and children is something special in the Philippine context.

        Let  us  consider  the  advertisement  involving  mother  and  children  over  the  last  sixty  years  in  a  host  of
        categories. That will probably give us some idea about how important mother and child are in the Philippine
        context when it comes advertising. Till date, even in the digital era, mother-child association is carried on by

        brands.
               Let us get into unconventional example concerned with cultural aspects. Dating as a cultural habit is
        not accepted by the mainstream population of India. This is not to say that dating is absent in urban context.

        This is only to emphasize that it is not a traditional belief, or a traditional value associated with Indians. When
        the brand Tinder which is to do with the dating service entered into the Indian context, it ran an advertising

        campaign in India that was associated to mother and daughter. The ad shows the mother encouraging the
        daughter to use the dating application. It is an attempt from the brand to capitalize on the idea “mommy knows
        the best”. The brand believed that the idea of a mother recommending the dating app to the daughter would

        neutralize the awkwardness that Indians associate with dating.
               So, one can see that a clear understanding of the cultural influences on the consumer’s perception of

        a category can enable a brand to introduce new kinds of values despite the presence of strongly entrenched
        traditional values that are opposing in nature.

              IV. CULTURAL SYMBOLISM


               Another interesting aspect with respect to consumer behavior is Cultural Symbolism. It is to be noted
        that any activity associated with marketing happens in the context of culture. This is not only true with respect

        to the Philippine context; this also holds good for any aspect of marketing in any part of the world. Cultural
        symbolism is associated with how cultural aspects play a role in symbolizing certain cultural practices or
        habits.

               Let us take the interesting example of Dettol. Dettol is an antiseptic. And perhaps most consumers
        may not be as involved in an antiseptic as they are with an upmarket, higher-priced to watch. Given the

        history of Dettol in Philippines and its usage by consumer segments, Dettol stings upon the application on a
        wound. It has a specific odor. When we talk about cultural symbolism, the fundamental question is- have
        consumers got used to the stinging sensation and a different kind of odor of Dettol to associate it with the

        curative powers of an antiseptic?



                                                                                                                9]]></page><page Index="116"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY
                     Tanza ǀ Trece Martires City ǀ Gen. Trias City Campus

               In this case, there is also some kind of sensory branding which comes into the picture. Smelling is a
        kind of sensation; sense of touch is associated with the burning sensation that is created by the brand Dettol.
        So essentially, it is a combination of cultural symbolism and experiential aspects of the brand associated with

        the curative power of Dettol that has created a strong positioning in terms of cultural symbolism.
               Even  in  the  case  of  pain  balm  it  is  very  common  to  find  consumers  trying  to  look  for  a  burning
        sensation as a reflection of brands efficacy in terms of bringing down pain. So, this specific aspect of the

        consumers’ expectations of a pain balm trying to create a hot sensation on application is an example of
        cultural symbolism.
               Let us take another example which is from the commonplace aspects of Consumer Behavior in the

        Indian context. Rusk is made with breadcrumbs and it is an extremely popular product in several parts of the
        country. Rusk has been consumed by Indians for the last several decades. It is not uncommon to find people

        in a roadside tea stall enjoying their conversation over rusk. The recent times Britannia has branded rusk and
        positioned it as a conversation trigger. Rusk in the advertisement of Britannia symbolizes fun times, good
        times and conversations that are a part of a pleasure among a group of consumers. This example shows

        how cultural symbolism can be portrayed with specific advertising in a specific context.
               One of the most interesting cases with respect to cultural symbolism is the case of Kellogg's in the

        Indian context. Possibly only in the Indian context, Kellogg's advertised that Kellogg's corn flakes need to be
        taken with hot milk whereas in several other parts of the world corn flakes is consumed with cold milk. The
        cultural symbolism here is all about hot milk, the fullness, and the food becoming tasty with the addition of

        hot  milk.  Milk  is  a  central  part  of  the  Indian  culture,  and  the  practice  and  ritual  of  heating  milk  before
        consumption has been taken into account in the advertising strategy of Kellogg. In a country with a diverse
        cultural orientation, cultural symbolism plays an important role in consumer behavior.

               V. DIGITALIZATION AND CONSUMER BEHAVIOR



               The traditional four-Ps of marketing namely: Product, Price, Promotion, and Place have been in place
        with respect to the marketing context and the marketeer strategies. At this point in time, as we study the

        importance of the basic principles of Consumer Behavior, we need to be familiar with application of four-Ps
        of marketing before moving into Consumer Behavior. This is because Consumer Behavior gets enhanced
        and harnessed with the understanding of the basic principles like segmentation, brand equity, product line

        management, and advertising management. The traditional Ps of marketing are probably one of fundamental
        ways in which brand differentiation is achieved.

                                                                                                              10]]></page><page Index="117"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY

               Philip Kotler had introduced the Four Cs of the digital world.
               The fourth Cs are:
               1. Co-creation,

               2. Communal exchanges,
               3. Conversations and
               4. Currency.

               Co-creation is probably the ultimate dream of marketeers. Co-creation is associated with creating a
        product or service with active participation of the consumer with respect to their preferences and needs. The
        next stop for several other brands, especially in online marketing, would be to co-create the offerings at the

        ultimate level of catering to individual preferences and needs. In the Indian context a typical example of co-
        creation is the manner in which companies like Asian Paints tried to create some kind of co-creation in terms

        of taking into account the consumer preferences for colors that they use in their homes.
               Currency is associated with the extent to which consumers provide continuous revenue associated
        with the brand. I'd like to remind the students that Theodore Levitt several decades back talked about every

        product becoming a service, and this is about to become a reality. For instance, in the days to come possibly
        consumers may not be interested in detergents; they may be interested completely in laundry services which

        detergent is only a part of. We already have online laundry services which have been introduced in the Indian
        context.
               Coming back to currency as a revenue stream, the fundamental challenge of digital world for every

        brand is to ensure that the revenue is generated with respect to the brands offerings. And we will see more
        of services being introduced with almost every brand in every category, depending on the consumer segment
        associated with the brand.

               Communal  exchanges  today  are  seen  with  respect  to  websites  like  eBay  and  Olx.  These  are
        websites which have created the culture of consumers exchanging goods and products among themselves.
               Finally, conversation is about how well the word of mouth is harnessed favorably by brands in the

        digital world. The word of mouth in the digital world has got two directions: one is positive and the other one
        is negative. Word of mouth is important both for services as well as brands and brands, and services get built

        up on word of mouth.
               When we consider an example from the personal beauty segment in the Philippines, a brand like Luxe
        Organix serves to illustrate how word of mouth would work in the consumer's minds. Luxe Organix is a brand

        which has a positive word of mouth in the social media. The brand hardly advertises but still has a high level
        of loyal consumers. On the other hand, we have the global example of Galaxy from Samsung caught in

        negative word of mouth. So, word of mouth or conversations can have bi-polar directions and the brand
        needs to be conscious of the same.
               Coming back to the traditional Ps and the contemporary Cs of marketing, your marketeer today has

        to  ensure  that the traditional  Ps  of marketing  are  well  synergized  and  integrated  with  the  contemporary
        aspects of the digital world.

                                                                                                              11]]></page><page Index="118"><![CDATA[CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY

               • The revival of SunSilk brand of shampoo in the reason times with its website on the SunSilk gang
        of girls, is an excellent example of how word of mouth builds up a brand among the target consumers.
               • Parle-G, which is consumed by both the rich and the poor, had come out with the social media

        campaign that emphasizes the relationship between a consumer and Parle-G.
               So social media makes use of the word of mouth, and the brand needs to ensure it monitors the social
        media as appropriate. It must be noted that consumer behavior is dynamic, exciting, and challenging in any

        competitive context.

                                      The Basics of Market Research



                “Research is to see what everybody else has seen, and to think what nobody else has thought.”
                                                    --Albert Szent-Gyorgi

               Chapter Learning Outcomes
               By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

                   1.  define marketing research;
                   2.  determine the role and use of market research to business organizations; and

                   3.  identify the researchable market issues.




                                             What is Marketing Research?



                       To establish a solid foundation for studying marketing research, you will first need to
               understand its role in and relationship to marketing.


               Marketing
                       The  American  Marketing  Association  defines  marketing  as  the  activity,  set  of

               institutions, and processes for creating, communicating, delivering, and exchanging offerings
               that have value for customers, clients, partners, and society at large.
                       To  practice  marketing  well  in  today’s  environment  requires  more  and  better

               information. As you will learn, marketing research provides information to decision makers to
               enable  them  to  market  ideas,  goods,  and  services  properly.  When  firms  make  the  right

               decisions, they produce products and services that their target markets perceive as having
               value. That value translates into sales, profits, and a positive return on investment.
                       To  market  ideas,  goods,  and  services  properly,  you  must  begin  with  the  right

               philosophy, that is the marketing concept, followed by marketing strategy.


               Marketing Concept
                       A philosophy may be thought of as a system of values or principles by which you live.
               Your values or principles are important because they dictate what you do each day. This is

               why philosophies are so important; your philosophy affects your day-to-day decisions.]]></page><page Index="122"><![CDATA[4


                       The  same  connection  between  philosophy  and  action  holds  true  for  business
               managers. One of the most important philosophies managers have is that which determines

               how they view their company’s role in terms of what it provides the market. Some managers
               have a philosophy that “we make and sell product X.” A quick review of marketing history will
               tell us this philosophy is known as a product orientation. Another philosophy, known as sales

               orientation, is illustrated by the following statement: “To be successful we must set high sales
               quotas  and  sell,  sell,  sell!”  Managers  who  guide  their  companies  by  either  of  these

               philosophies may guide them right out of business.
                       A much more effective philosophy, marketing concept, which was defined by Philip
               Kotler  as  a  business  philosophy  that  holds  that  the  key  to  achieving  organizational  goals

               consists of the company being more effective than competitors in creating, delivering, and
               communicating customer value to its chosen target markets.

                       The  marketing  concept  is  used  interchangeably  as  market  driven  or  customer
               orientation, but the key point is that this philosophy puts the consumer first.


               Marketing Strategy
                       A marketing strategy consists of selecting a segment of the market as the company’s
               target  market  and  designing  the  proper  “mix”  of  product/service,  price,  promotion,  and

               distribution system to meet the wants and needs of the consumers within the target market.
                       Many  decisions  must  be  made  to  develop  the  right  strategy.  To  make  the  right
               decisions, managers must have objective, accurate, and timely information.

                       To practice marketing, to implement the marketing concept, and to make the decisions
               necessary  to  create  the  right  marketing  strategy,  managers  need  information.  That  is  the

               relationship of marketing to marketing research. Marketing research supplies managers with
               the information to help them make these decisions.


               Marketing Research
                       Marketing research is the process of designing, gathering, analyzing, and reporting

               information that may be used to solve a specific marketing problem.
                       The American Marketing Association define marketing research as follows:
                       Marketing research is the function that links the consumer, customer, and public to the

               marketer through information—information used to identify and define marketing opportunities
               and  problems;  generate,  refine,  and  evaluate  marketing  actions;  monitor  marketing
               performance; and improve the understanding of marketing as a process. Marketing research

               specifies the information required to address these issues, designs the method for collecting
               information, manages and implements the data collection process, analyzes the results, and

               communicates the findings and their implications.]]></page><page Index="123"><![CDATA[5






                                        The Role and Uses of Market Research


                       Customers always have been the most important part of a business. Today, if you do
               not put the customer at the center of your business, you will, over time, have no business. In

               other words, market research has always been with us.
                       Marketing research is used to answer fundamental questions that affect the future of
               an organization. Therefore, marketing research is a skill needed by all types of organizations,

               both large and small. Small businesses as well as large corporations can benefit from the
               knowledge  that  research  provides.  In  addition,  community,  arts  and  other  non-profit
               organizations can also benefit.

                       Small  businesses  may  believe  that  they  do  not  have  the  resources  to  conduct
               marketing research. However, a small business usually operates on a narrow profit margin

               leaving it particularly vulnerable to competition. Even losing a small percentage of customers
               can mean potential bankruptcy. Therefore, small businesses need to research what products
               and services customers want and need. In addition, it is essential that they conduct research

               on  a  continual  basis  as  to  what  products  and  services  are  being  offered  by  competing
               businesses.

                       Non-profit  organizations  may  also  feel  that  they  do  not  have  the  time  or  money
               necessary  to  conduct  research.  Yet  all  types  of  non-profit  organizations  can  benefit  from
               conducting  research.  For  example,  community-based  social  service  non-profits  could  use

               research to determine what services are needed by the people they serve. Other non-profits,
               such as arts organizations, face the challenge of finding audiences and can use research to
               help with segmentation and promotion decisions.

                       Large corporations often have internal marketing research departments. Even so, they
               sometimes hire specialized external marketing research firms to conduct research. Marketing
               research  is  especially  necessary  when  corporations  develop  new  products  or  reposition

               current products. Research is needed to thoroughly analyze consumer  needs,  as a failed
               introduction or repositioning of a product can be a very costly mistake.]]></page><page Index="124"><![CDATA[6



                         What can we find out?    What does it mean?     What should we do?

                            Systematic and         Inferences on and      Recommendations
                             objective data        interpretation of       or options on the
                               collection              the data            courses of action


                                            Figure 1.1 The Role of Market Research


                       In addition, the AMA definition of marketing research enumerate the uses of marketing
               research. First is the identification of market opportunities and problems.
                       Some marketing research studies are designed to find out what consumers’ problems

               are and to assess the suitability of different proposed methods of resolving those problems.
               Consumers wanted complete portability in their music, so Apple developed the iPod. High
               gasoline  prices  and  concerns  about  fossil  emissions  bothered  consumers,  so  Toyota

               developed the Prius. Consumers wanted increasingly large TV screens to hang on their walls,
               so Samsung developed an ultra-thin, LED, large-screen TV.

                       You  would  think  that  managers  would  always  know  what  their  problems  are  but
               problems  are  not  always  easy  to  identify.  Managers  are  more  likely  to  always  know  the
               symptoms  (sales  are  down,  market  share  is  falling)  but  determining  the  cause/s  of  the

               symptoms sometimes requires research.
                       Marketing research  can also be  used to generate,  refine, and evaluate a  potential
               marketing action. These actions may be thought of as strategies, campaigns, programs, or

               tactics. Strategies involve selection of a target market and designing a marketing mix to satisfy
               the wants and needs of that target market.
                       Marketing research is conducted in a variety of areas, including determining target

               markets  and  conducting  product  research,  pricing  research,  promotion  research,  and
               distribution research. Here are some of these instances:

                        A great deal of marketing research is conducted to determine the size of various
                         market  segments.  Not  only  are  managers  interested  in  knowing  the  size  of  the
                         market segment but they want to know if that segment is growing or shrinking and

                         how well competitors are fulfilling the wants and needs of that segment.
                        Successful companies are constantly looking for new products and services. As a

                         result,  they  must  have  a  process  in  place  to  identify  and  test  new  products.
                         Research studies are also conducted on the proposed brand names and package
                         designs of products before commercialization.

                        When a revolutionary new product is created, marketers use research to determine
                         the  “value”  consumers  perceive  in  the  new  product.  Marketing  research  is  also]]></page><page Index="125"><![CDATA[7


                         conducted to determine how consumers will react to different types of pricing tactics
                         such as “buy one, get one free” versus a “one-half-off” price offer.

                        As firms spend so much money on promotion, they want to know how effective those
                         expenditures  are  for  the  advertising,  sales  force,  publicity/PR,  and  promotional

                         offers. Firms also conduct research on the effectiveness of different media.
                        To effectively and efficiently distribute the products to the market, the firm should

                         know what are the best channels to get their product to consumers, should they use
                         multichannel distribution and/or how many distributors should they have.


                      Furthermore, improving our understanding of the marketing process entails conducting
               some  marketing  research  to  expand  our  basic  knowledge  of  marketing.  Typical  of  such
               research  would  be  attempts  to  define  and  classify  marketing  phenomena  and  to  develop

               theories  that  describe,  explain,  and  predict  marketing  phenomena.  Basic  research  is
               conducted  to  expand  our  knowledge  rather  than  to  solve  a  specific  problem.    This  basic
               research  is  not  conducted  for  any  specific  company  problem  but  rather  to  increase  our

               understanding of satisfying consumers of services.
                      Research  conducted  to  solve  specific  problems  is  called  applied  research,  which

               represents  the  vast  majority  of  marketing  research  studies.  For  the  most  part,  marketing
               research firms are conducting research to solve a specific problem facing a company.





                                                    Research Issues


                       There are a number of different issues that an organization can choose to research
               (see Table 1.1). Research on the consumer marketplace can be used to determine who is
               buying a specific product. Companies should also consider conducting research regarding

               competitors’ products and services as it can provide valuable information on how a business
               can  improve.  For  example,  organizations  should  analyze  their  customers’  perception  of
               competitors, as such research helps to determine whether companies should add to their own

               products any of the benefits provided by competing products.
                       Market  research  can  determine  the  composition  of  the  current  customer  segment.
               Consumer research can examine customers’ reasons for purchasing and is critical to both

               increasing the current market segment and finding new target markets. Distribution research
               is conducted to determine if the product is being sold at the right locations. Organizations also

               need to use research to determine if a specific product has the benefits that consumers desire.]]></page><page Index="126"><![CDATA[8


               Another important area of research is determining if a product is being effectively promoted.
               Lastly,  determining  the  correct  price  for  a  product  can  make  the  difference  between  a

               successful and unsuccessful product launch. Information gathered on all of these issues will
               help businesses to learn where and how they need to improve.

                       Marketing research focuses on understanding the customer, the company, and the
               competition.  These  relationships  are  at  the  core  of  marketing  research.  Companies  must

               understand  and  respond  to  what  customers  want  from  their  products.  However,  this
               relationship is always influenced by competitors and how their products are received by the
               market.  Thus,  market  researchers  must  clearly  identify  the  customer,  company,  and

               competition before developing a research project.
                       There are several important factors a market researcher must consider before they
               begin, including:

                         Customers and competition
                         Awareness and image of the product

                         Product usage
                         Undiagnosed problems with the product

                         Customer desires and needs for new product development

               Overview

                       What is marketing? Is it same as selling or advertising? Most people have heard

               the term 'marketing' and often they have some understanding of it too. But usually,


               their view of marketing is partial or biased. Very few properly understand what the

               concept really means.


                       Many  people  tend  to  think  of  marketing  as selling, shopping or advertising.

               Though these assumptions are not completely wrong, they are not completely true

               either. Marketing is much more than selling or advertising - it involves a broader scope


               of activities and ideas.]]></page><page Index="129"><![CDATA[Mktg 80 - Marketing Management

                       Marketing deals with identifying and meeting human and social needs. One of

               lower price and creates knock-down furniture—all illustrate a drive to turn a private or

               social need into a profitable business opportunity through marketing



               Meaning and Types of Market


                       Market is defined as a physical place where potential customers, buyers, and

               sellers gathered, they gathered together and to buy and sell some goods. Today, in a


               more  complex  business  environment,  a  market  means  a  set  of  buyers,  sellers,

               intermediaries, and organizations who are involved in the process of exchange. As per


               Oxford illustrated dictionary, market is the gathering of people for the purchase and

               sale of provisions, livestock, etc., and the space, it could be open or covered, that is


               used for the same purpose. Though the meaning of market remains the same, there

               are different types of markets. There are broadly three types of market that we will be


               discussing as part of this course, one is the consumer market, the business market,

               and finally the institutional market.

               What is meant by Market?



                       The first type of market that is called the consumer market. It is also called B2C

               market  that  is  business  to  consumer  market.  As  the  name  suggests,  it  is  the  end


               consumers of various merchandise like products that are purchased by the consumer

               for their own or household usage that constitutes the consumer market. Every week

               you  or  your  family  might  be  buying  vegetables  from  the  market.  In  addition  to


               vegetables,  you  might  be  buying  household  items,  or  groceries,  baby  care  items,

               blankets,  towels,  dresses,  furniture,  soap,  detergent.  All  these  things  are  part  of


               consumer market. What’s common across all these items? These are the products

               that is used within the households and that is used by the final consumer.  So, the


               market  involved  here  is  called  consumer  market.  Please  keep  it  in  mind  that  the

               products brought and sold in the market doesn't decide the type of market here. It is


               the buyers and sellers that decide the type of market. Majority of the things that we will

               be discussing at part of this course will be talking about consumer market. However,


               that's not the only market here.

               The other type of market is called business market. Let’s say you want to buy coconut


               oil.  Now  when  a  coconut  oil  is  bought  for  your  own  consumption  that  becomes

               consumer market. If the same coconut oil is purchased by HUL to make glycerin soap,


               then that becomes part of a business market. Please remember the products are the

               same here. A business market is defined as a market where output of one form goes

               either as raw material, or as processed goods, or as consumable goods into another


               industry. This is called B2B market that is business to business. Thus, in business

               market,  buyers  buy  goods  to  resell  at  some  point  of  time  for  profit  to  some  other


               business buyer. So, the major difference between the consumer and business market

               is the end user. For a consumer market, the product is used by the end consumer


               whereas  a  business  market,  the  product  is  used  by  a  business  entity  for  making

               something else, which eventually will be sold to the end consumer. In this market, the

               buyers are professionals who buy on the basis of rational evaluation of the offer, unlike


               in consumer market, where people make buying decisions on the basis of experience,


               emotions, sentiments, or even impulse. Also, in this business market, the purchasing

               is done generally in bulk, unlike in consumer market where people purchase in small

               quantities because it is for their own household consumptions. The third type of market


               is  called  institutional  market,  and  this  is  called  institutional  market  because  the

               purchase is done by institutions, organizations. The purchase is bulk just like business


               market. However, it is not for profit making. It is not for reselling to any third party. For

               example,  the  provisions  or  stationeries  purchased  by  hotels,  hospitals,  schools,


               universities  and  even  institutions  like  IIMB.  Let’s  say  IIMB  buys  chairs,  tables,

               benches,  laptops,  desks  for  its  students,  faculties,  staff.  These  are  all  part  of

               institutional purchasing. It is bulk purchasing, but not for reselling it to somebody else


               for profit making. So, this market is called institutional market.

               Terms that Define Marketing


                       The word marketing encompasses a broad scope of activities and ideas and

               thus settling on one definition is difficult. In the previous sub-section, we  saw how


               different individuals provided different description of what marketing is. Some describe

               it as a bridge between customers and sellers, some term it as communication, some


               interpret it as advertising and so on. Over a period of time, various experts, authors

               and  professionals  have  described  marketing  in  different  ways  using  different


               perceptual routes. Some of these descriptions are given in the table below.




                  an art                        a science                        a function




                  a process                     a practice                       a system



                  a philosophy                  an exchange process              an activity







               Kotler's Marketing Definition Explained



                       The following video is devoted to the elaboration and explanation of the various

               key words used in this social definition of marketing. Understanding the keywords will


               not only help us to understand the concept of marketing but also to appreciate the role

               of marketing within an organization.








                                                            6]]></page><page Index="134"><![CDATA[Mktg 80 - Marketing Management




                       So, what are the key terms in this definition? The first one is societal process.


               It is process and it is societal. Hence, we say that marketing is a societal process

               where the marketer satisfies the consumption requirements of the consumers inside


               the society and hence the starting point, which is the societal process. The second,

               you must be wondering why two terms individuals and groups used separately? Now

               individuals behaving individually and individuals behaving in a group are very different


               from each other. So, when you go to buy any item individually for yourself or for your

               family,  you  decide  based  on  your  own  choices  whereas  if  you  go  along  with  your


               friends  or  along  with  your  family  to  buy  even  a  simple  item,  the  decision-making

               process takes a long-winded elongated route. So even the group behavior is different


               than individual behavior and this kind of distinction can be seen in the shopping pattern

               as well. What you buy, how you buy, how much you buy so on and so forth. So, the

               way a consumer behaves in a store and chooses the product when she is alone and


               when she is in a group is entirely different and hence the definition. We will talk about


               the requirements, and individuals and groups differently at different points of time. The

               next  part.  Need  and  want.  One  of  the  most  important  things,  important  basis  for

               marketing. Marketers clearly tried to satisfy the needs and wants of consumers, but


               there is a difference between need and want. Need is a felt sense of deprivation of

               some basic necessities, for example, food, clothing, shelter, or anything without which


               today you will not be able to survive.

                       What is creating? What do marketers create? The product. The service. And


               why? Because it will satisfy the needs and wants of the consumer. So, if the product

               doesn't exist, it has to be created. Example: Sony Walkman, digital cameras, iPods,

               whatever it is. Lot of things we can think of it, which were not there and there was a


               need, which was identified, and the product was created. If it is there, then it will be



                                                            7]]></page><page Index="135"><![CDATA[Mktg 80 - Marketing Management




               offered. These  kinds  of  products  were  created  through  disruptive  innovations. The


               digital cameras, the Walkman or the iPods with iTunes. The consumers may have

               failed. The want for such products and the business created the product to meet the


               need and wants. Please remember that creations are always not necessarily great

               creations or disruptive innovations. It could be small, incremental changes that we see

               most often, such as shampoos and sachets, healthy salts, oil, liquid soap. What is


               offering here? Offering is when the product is created, even if it is already existed, it

               needs  to  be  offered  to  the  market  with  an  optimal  blend  of  price,  distribution  and


               promotion. For example, you could have seen how various smartphone companies

               launch their offers. They provide the product that is the smartphone. They make it


               available in the store that is convenient to the customer, ensure that their prices are

               attractive  by  giving  discounts  or  EMI  schemes  and  etc.,  and  provide  adequate

               consumer service. So, these are the ways by which the items are offered. So, we have


               done two things by now: creating and offering. The third thing is free exchange. The


               term free is very important out here, that means both the parties, the buyer and seller,

               they should have alternatives. So, both of them should have the freedom to sell or not

               sell, to buy or not buy. Exchanging in marketing context means obtaining a desired


               product from someone by offering something else in return. We buy items we need

               and want by giving money to the seller and this process is called exchanging. The next


               part that I want to talk about is products and services of value. Product and service, I

               have by now told you many times are anything that satisfies your needs. A shampoo


               bottle satisfies your hygiene needs whereas a car satisfies your transportation needs.

               That  means  these  are  your  needs  satisfiers.  The  product  and  services  could  also

               satisfy multiple needs, need not be only one. For example, a diner in a five-star hotel


               definitely satisfies your hunger needs. However, it also satisfies the esteem, the ego



                                                            8]]></page><page Index="136"><![CDATA[Mktg 80 - Marketing Management




               related needs. Each of these products and services can be marketed. So, products


               and services that are created, offered and exchanged is part of our marketing activity.

               But for all these things to happen, this should be of value to the customer. Customers


               should identify this is significant. This is profit for him. Simple terms, what is value?

               Utility  per  cost.  How  much  is  the  benefit  for  the  customer  that  is  the  tangible  and

               intangible benefits and how much they have to pay? What is the cost for it? Again,


               both physical and emotional cost. Let me elaborate. For example, in case of buying a

               washing  machine,  the  utility  consists  of  procuring  the  physical  product  that  is  the


               washing machine, which is the tangible part. Convenience in cleaning as well as the

               time that you save from the cloth cleaning activity constitutes the intangible part here.


               Now the cost, cost would consist of the money that you pay for it. That is the physical

               part of it, and the time and energy that you spend in searching for the appropriate

               brand, that is, the emotional part of it. If according to the customer, the total utility is


               more than the total cost, then he or she will see value in the product.




               Different Definitions of Marketing

               Till  now  we  saw  the  various  definitions  of  marketing. Here  is  the  list  of  various


               definitions of marketing given the marketing experts like Philip Kotler and Professional

               Body like American Marketing Association.


                 Marketing is a societal process by which individuals and groups obtain what they

                   need  and  want  through  creating,  offering,  and  freely  exchanging  products  and


                   services of value with others.

                 Marketing  is  the  set  of  activities,  set  of  institutions  and  processes  for  creating,

                   communicating, delivering and exchanging offerings that have value for customers,


                   clients, partners and society at large.



                                                            9]]></page><page Index="137"><![CDATA[Mktg 80 - Marketing Management




                 Marketing  is  an  organizational  function  and  a  set  of  processes  for  creating,


                   communicating,  delivering  value  for  customers  and  for  managing  customer

                   relationships in ways that benefit the organizations and its stakeholders.



                 Marketing is the performance of business activities that directs the flow of goods

                   and services from producer to consumer or user.



               Relationship of Marketing with Social System



               It is very important to understand and appreciate the significance of the relationship


               between marketing and the social system. We learnt what 'needs and wants' mean in

               the definition of marketing given by Philip Kotler. These human needs and wants are


               shaped by the interplay of various social forces.



               As society consists of human beings, every society also has a set of needs and wants


               (collective) in order to survive. These societal needs and wants could be more than

               the sum total of the individual needs and it requires comprehensive addressing.




               For example, food is an individual need; however, making food available at every nook

               and cranny of the society is a societal need which is more than the individual need.


               Having enough retail stores and brands could solve the individual need (providing

               food). Superior infrastructure and delivery system would help solving the collective


               need. 'Marketing' works on both of these fronts of the society.



               Thus marketing evolves through this social system and involves relationships among


               different members of the society. Hence its importance extends to society as a whole.



               For instance:




                                                           10]]></page><page Index="138"><![CDATA[Mktg 80 - Marketing Management




                 Marketing helps in introducing new products that eases or enriches people’s lives.



                 It creates new opportunities in the market wherever there is any shortcomings or

                  necessity



                 It helps in creating demand for products and services, which, in turn, creates jobs.


                 It contributes to improving the lifestyle of people at various economic levels of


                  society by converting social issue into a business opportunity thereby creating win-

                  win situation to both organizations and the society.



               Thus, we can say that  marketing is  not only about identifying and  meeting human


               needs and wants but also about being a part of overall development of a society as a

               whole.

                       Marketing  people  are  involved  in  marketing  10  types  of  entities:  goods,

               services, experiences, events, persons, places, properties, organizations, information,

               and ideas.




               Goods.  Physical  goods  constitute  the  bulk  of  most  countries’  production  and

               marketing effort. The United States produces and markets billions of physical goods,

               from eggs to steel to hair  dryers. In  developing  nations, goods— particularly food,


               commodities, clothing, and housing—are the mainstay of the economy.



               Services. As economies advance, a growing proportion of their activities are focused


               on the production of services. The U.S. economy today consists of a 70–30 services-

               to-goods mix. Services include airlines, hotels, and maintenance and repair people,

               as well as professionals such as accountants, lawyers, engineers, and doctors. Many


               market offerings consist of a variable mix of goods and services.



               Experiences. By orchestrating several services and goods, one can create, stage,

               and market experiences. Walt Disney World’s Magic Kingdom is an experience; so is


               the Hard Rock Cafe.



               Events. Marketers promote time-based events, such as the Olympics, trade shows,

               sports events, and artistic performances.



               Persons.  Celebrity  marketing  has  become  a  major  business.  Artists,  musicians,


               CEOs, physicians, high-profile lawyers and financiers, and other professionals draw


               help from celebrity marketers.4



               Places.  Cities,  states,  regions,  and  nations  compete  to  attract  tourists,  factories,

               company  headquarters,  and  new  residents.5  Place  marketers  include  economic


               development  specialists,  real  estate  agents,  commercial  banks,  local  business

               associations, and advertising and public relations agencies.



               Properties. Properties are intangible rights of ownership of either real property (real


               estate) or financial property (stocks and bonds). Properties are bought and sold, and

               this occasions a marketing effort by real estate agents (for real estate) and investment

               companies and banks (for securities).




               Organizations. Organizations actively work to build a strong, favorable image in the

               mind of their publics. Philips, the Dutch electronics company, advertises with the tag


               line, “Let’s Make Things Better.” The Body Shop and Ben & Jerry’s also gain attention

               by promoting social causes. Universities, museums, and performing arts organizations


               boost their public images to compete more successfully for audiences and funds.



               Information.  The  production,  packaging,  and  distribution  of  information  is  one  of

               society’s  major  industries.6  Among  the  marketers  of  information  are  schools  and


               universities;  publishers  of  encyclopedias,  nonfiction  books,  and  specialized

               magazines; makers of CDs; and Internet Web sites.



               Ideas. Every market offering has a basic idea at its core. In essence, products and


               services are platforms for delivering some idea or benefit to satisfy a core need.






               Food for Thought


               When you are at a checkout counter at a store or a super market, do you notice
               that candies, chocolates, magazines, new cosmetics etc. are displayed? Do you
               know why? Because during peak hours waiting time could be longer and this is
               when consumers indulge in impulse purchases.

               What is Marketing Environment?

                     The marketing environment consists of a micro-environment such as actors engaged in

               producing, distributing and promoting its offering. These are called internal factors that is close


               to the company because they have a direct impact on the organization’s strategy, and they

               are controllable by the organization, whether completely or partially. These factors include

               competitors,  customers,  employees,  the  suppliers  to  the  organization  and  the  various

               shareholders  in  the  organization.  So,  as  you  can  see,  while  employers  are  completely

               controllable  by  the  organization,  the  competitor,  the  customers,  the  suppliers,  and  the

               shareholders, they are not really controllable by the organization, but then because they are

               one  way  or  the  other  used  in  the  organization’s  business.  So,  organization  also  partially


               controls  them  one  way  or  the  other.  Macro  or  broad  environment  such  as  demographic

               environment, economic environment and so on, in this case, marketing manager will not be

               able to influence these external forces. However, the impact of these forces too will be felt in

               the organization’s strategy and implementation. Macro environmental factors would include

               demographic  factors,  cultural  factors,  social  factors,  economic  factors,  legal  and  political


               factors, technological environment, and even many natural factors. Now you can see here that

               the two types, one is something that organization can influence, organization can control and

               the other is something that the organization cannot control but is influenced by it. So, it is

               important over here for the organization to appreciate both these factors and keep a track of

               how  these  factors  are  changing,  and  accordingly  modify  and  develop  its  strategy.  So,

               analyzing this marketing environment, both external and internal, macro and micro is crucial

               to effectively monitor changes that may suddenly pose various opportunities or threats. This


               kind  of  analysis  is  done  through  environmental  scanning  and  analysis.  “Environmental

               scanning” refers to systematically collecting information about environmental forces that affect

               the performance of the company and of course its competitors. “Environmental analysis” refers

               to assessing, interpreting and estimating the gathered information and forecast the impact of

               various macro as well as micro environmental trends and focus it on organizational strategy.

               How this is going to influence organizational strategy? The organizations often develop or

               modify  their  strategies  based  on  such  information  in  order  to  achieve  their  objectives

               effectively.



































               Discussion Question


               "Technological  environment  is  one of  the macro  environmental  factors. How  do  you  think
               technology has affected marketing in the last 20 years. Discuss with an example."


               Marketing and Selling


                       Many  people  tend  to  think  of  ‘marketing’  as  synonymous  with


               ‘selling’.   Selling is  the  act  of persuading or influencing  a  customer to  buy  a

               product or service but marketing is much more than that. Selling and marketing bring

               different orientations to business; hence managers are expected to follow different


               kinds of strategies for business success. In this unit, we will discuss the difference

               between marketing and selling.


                       What  is  the  difference  between  Marketing  and  Selling?  Marketing  as  was

               defined  by  Reis  and  Trout  a  long  time  ago  in  their  best-selling  book  “Positioning”





                                                           19]]></page><page Index="147"><![CDATA[Mktg 80 - Marketing Management




               as The  Battle  for  the  Customers  Mind.  So  marketing  is  creating  a  demand  in  the


               customers mind so that they will seek you out. Sales on the other hand is chasing

               customers  and  asking  for  the  order.  Another  way  of  thinking  about  the  difference


               between selling and marketing is the difference between a product and a brand. A

               product is something that is typically created by a company, made in their factory and

               placed in stores or given to salesmen to sell. Much like what has been happening for


               a long time now with the American auto manufacturers. The assumption is that the

               cars will be sold by their dealer’s salesmen.




               Difference between Marketing and Selling


                       Most often selling is used as a synonym for marketing. While selling is surely part of

               marketing it is definitely not a synonym. Marketing is a  process, and the process involves


               selling as a promotional tool. However, because these two terms are used very frequently and

               almost used as a synonym, let’s look at the major differences between marketing and selling

               and clarify that right at the beginning. Now, the major difference is marketing starts with the

               consumer. Marketing tries to find out the requirement of the consumer and based on that they

               create an offering. However, selling starts with the marketer or the manufacturer. You have

               some items and then you find out the consumer to sell it. Let say Eureka Forbes guy to come

               to your house and give you a demo of the Euroclean or Aqua guard or any such kind of


               products and decide whether you want to buy or you do not want to buy it, then we call that

               marketing because it is the customer requirement you initiated the call and then he came to

               you  to  explain  the  products,  explain  the  functioning  of  the  product.  Selling  is  the  act  of

               persuading or influencing a customer to buy a product or a service. Marketing is much more

               than that. As you have understood it by now through our discussion of various definitions and


               processes. Now, marketing is a process of identifying customer needs, translating those needs

               into products and services, creating the demand for these products and service, and satisfying




                                                           20]]></page><page Index="148"><![CDATA[Mktg 80 - Marketing Management




               the consumer of course finally creating the value for the customer. There is another major

               difference, the emphasis of selling is more on closing the sale, that is, it is a short-term focus


               with no strategy for long-term development. On the contrary, the emphasis of marketing is on

               customer  satisfaction  with  a  strong  focus  on  building  a  brand  which  often  is  long-term  in

               nature.

               Introduction to Business Models



               Though marketing is one of the most crucial functions of any organization, it cannot

               work in isolation. There are various stakeholders and multiple activities in any business


               and a successful appreciation and interaction between these stakeholders is the key

               to feasibility of any business. Through the study of business models, we try to identify


               the reasons for the feasibility of any business. In other words, we try to answer this

               question: "How any business makes money?". In this unit, we will see what business


               model is and its significance to marketing.



               Business Model Templates




               A business model template typically has nine different blocks or constituents. They are

               the customer segment that is who is the customer, the value proposition that is what


               is value to the customer, the various channels that is how to reach the customer both

               physically,  as  well  as  emotionally,  or  cognitively.  And  the  fourth  component  is





                                                           23]]></page><page Index="151"><![CDATA[Mktg 80 - Marketing Management




               customer relations, how to develop and maintain relationships with the customer. Fifth,


               revenue stream. What will be the revenue cost and hence the net earnings? Sixth, key

               resources. What assets are required to deliver this value? That is physical resources,


               financial  resources,  manpower  resources,  intellectual  resources  whatever  kind  of

               resources. Seven, key activities. What activities need to be carried out to provide value

               to the customers? That is manufacturing, or retailing, or consulting, or supply chain,


               what kind of activities? Then the eighth component is key partnerships. What activities

               you  do  in-house  and  what  you  outsource?  And  if  you  outsource,  to  whom  do  you


               outsource? And the ninth component is the cost structure. What are the different costs

               incurred  to  operate  the  business?  That  is  the  fixed  cost,  the  variable  cost,  and


               eventually the economy of scale etc.



                       Typically,  for  a  business  which  is  based  on  marketing,  it  will  involve  the


               suppliers, the manufacturers, the third-party logistics. If you look up to the key activities

               then for a marketing organization, the key activities will be manufacturing, retailing,


               logistics,  supply  chain.  If  you  are  looking  at  key  resources,  what  will  be  the  key

               resources  for  a  marketing  organization?  It  would  be  brands.  It  would  be  customer

               databases. It will be manpower who run the business, the distribution network which


               is very important for marketing, the financial power to run the business, launch new

               products, launch new brands, reach out to new customers. If you look up to the value


               proposition,  very  significant,  what  is  value  to  the  customer?  What  will  satisfy  the

               customer? So, typically, if you look up to a marketing organization or different products


               and brands, why do people buy the products and brands? So that typically would be

               price conscious consumers, or value conscious consumers, or experience seeking


               consumers, or luxury seeking consumers. So that will lead to the obvious things, who




                                                           24]]></page><page Index="152"><![CDATA[Mktg 80 - Marketing Management




               are the customers? Geographic, demographic, psychographic, behavioral,  different


               type of consumer segments, how to establish relationship with the customers and of

               course  the  channels  that  is  distribution  network,  store  formats,  online  formats,  the


               different promotion that is the emotional connect. So these are the different attributes

               of a business model. Apart from that, of course, we will be talking about the cost and

               the revenue streams. So this is quite relevant for a marketing organization.




               Value Chain



               The concept of value chain was provided by Professor Michael Porter in 1985 in his


               classic  book  called  Competitive  Advantage.  So  any  marketing  organization  can

               provide value to the customer by identifying their needs, and preparing a package, or


               preparing an offering about these 4 P's to satisfy their needs. To achieve this above,

               the organization need to carry out many individual discrete activities like identifying the

               need, designing the product, mass production of the same, delivering products to the


               customer,  and  ensure  the  support  service  etc.  Now  each  of  these  activities  would


               contribute to the firm's relative cost structure that is when you design a product, you

               spend  money.  You  design  a  distribution  channel,  you  spend  money.  So  low-cost

               physical distribution system, logistics efficiency, high productivity of the salesforce,


               highly  efficient  customer  support.  So  each  of  these  things  contributes  to  the  cost

               structure.  So  sometimes  you  spend  more.  Sometimes  you  spend  less.  So  if  your


               salesforce  is  efficient,  you  spend  less.  If  they  are  not  efficient,  you  spend  more.

               Physical distribution system, if it is efficient, you spend less. If it is not efficient, you


               spend more. So this could create the basis for differentiation like a procurement of

               high  quality  raw  material  could  be  a  basis  for  differentiation.  Tie-up  with  the  best

               vendors  or  suppliers  available  could  be  a  basis  of  differentiation.  Highly  efficient



                                                           25]]></page><page Index="153"><![CDATA[Mktg 80 - Marketing Management




               accounting  and  order  processing  system  could  be  a  basis  of  differentiation.  So  a


               systemic way of analyzing each and every activity a firm performs and ascertaining its

               differentiation ability as well as the profitability is called value chain. A value chain,


               according to Porter, a value chain disaggregates a firm into its strategically relevant

               activities, many of them I told you just now in order to understand the behavior of the

               costs and the potential source of differentiation. So where do you spend money and


               where do you get it back. So if you look up to this value chain model of Michael Porter

               what he does essentially is divides the firm's activities into two different segments.


               One  is  the  primary  activity  that  is  he  speaks  about  inbound  logistics,  the  store

               operations,  or  any  other  kind  of  operations,  the  outbound  logistics,  marketing  and


               sales, and service. So these are the essential activities or central activities for the

               survival of the firm and then the activities that perverts each of these activities, that is,

               support activities. They are firm infrastructure resources, human resource, technology


               and procurement. So then this also could change if your organization is different and


               the type of business that you do that would be different, then your primary activities

               and  support  activities  could  also  change.  The  essential  framework  over  here  talks

               about identify the primary activities, identify the support activities and then find out the


               margin. So that is your profit. That is the money that you are going to make out of the

               business.

               Summarizing Value Chain




               Value Chain can be summarized as a chain of activities by which an organization can:



                 Get materials



                 Create a product


                 Market the product and


                 Provide service once product is sold.




                       Each step mentioned above has the potential for creating more value for the

               customer. The organization has to look at the costs and performance linked with each


               activity, evaluate them and enhance the processes in order to benefit the customers.

               SUMMARY



                      The objective of this course is to have a basic understanding of marketing, the

               marketing  functions,  and  its  various  decision  areas.  At  the  end  of  the  course,  we

               should  be  capable  of  appreciating  and  developing  a  comprehensive  marketing


               strategy  for  sustainable  competitive  advantage.  This  week  we  developed  the

               background  to  the  understanding  and  appreciation  of  marketing  as  an  academic


               discipline. We also developed our elementary understanding of organization strategy

               and value chain. Apart from discussing the very concept of marketing and marketing


               management, we did spend some time on its evolution and some jargons of marketing

               that  you  will  come  across  frequently  in  the  next  few  weeks.  Hopefully,  this


               understanding  will  make  our  onward  journey  easier.  Next  week,  we  will  start  with

               identifying  and  understanding  the  most  important  stakeholder  in  marketing  -  the


               customers.

                         Create a video content: Take your position on “Marketing shapes consumer

                         needs and wants” versus “Marketing merely reflects the needs and wants of


                         consumers”
