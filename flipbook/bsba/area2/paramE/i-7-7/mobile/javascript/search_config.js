This  also  determined  the  relationship                between  managers'  leadership  styles  and  employee  work  performance.  It  employed  a                descriptive research design using a survey questionnaire administered using Google forms.                For this study, the researcher used the purposive sampling technique to consider 100 service                crews from selected fast food restaurants in Tanza, Cavite. They have been employed for at                least a year to review their immediate superior's leadership styles better. Data were tabulated                and analyzed using SPSS. Results show that participative leadership style was the perceived                leadership  style  of  managers  in  the  selected  fast  food  restaurants.  Also,  most  of  the                respondents  were  rated  very  satisfactory  work  performance  by  their  respective  managers.                Results also show a small positive relationship between the authoritative leadership style of                managers and employees' work performance, and the relationship is significant. Results also                reveal  that  while  managers'  participative  and  democratic  leadership  styles  have  negligible                negative relationships with employees' work performances, the relationships are significant.                Furthermore,  there  is  no  significant  difference  when  respondents'  views  of  managers'                leadership  styles  are  classified  by  gender,  age,  civil  status,  educational  attainment,  and                duration with the organization.                 Keywords: Leadership styles, work performance, fastfood restaurants                  1.0 INTRODUCTION                 Leadership  can  be  viewed  as  a  novel  and  effective  strategy  for  managing  individuals  and                corporations. The old idea of Personnel Administration has increasingly given way to Human                Resource Management to  emphasize the strategic  integration of  new  leadership styles  into                successful  employee  management  and  to  increase  employee  performance.  To  satisfy  the                demands of the context in which they operate, an effective leader must establish a good style.                Different  leadership  styles  are  used  that  fit  employee  based  on  the  amount  of  direction,                empowerment,  and  decision-making  power.  An  administrative  phenomenon  reflects  the                contingency  of  leadership,  and  style,  situation,  and  performance  criteria  have  been  left  to                suffocate  on  their  own.  As  a  result,  employee  performance  was  affected  due to  a  lack  of                proper  direction  and  application  of  strategic  style  in  managing  daily  duties  (Haider  et  al.,                2015).                  www.ijrehc.com                             Copyright © IJREHC 2022, All right reserved   Page 244","International Journal of Research in Education Humanities and Commerce                                                            Volume 03, Issue 05 \"September - October 2022\"                                                                                            ISSN 2583-0333                  Leadership is the interpersonal process by which a leader influences, motivates, and enables                others to contribute to the effectiveness and success of the organization to which they belong.                Furthermore, leadership style  is defined as a person's behavior pattern when attempting to                influence others. It is also the way and approach to delivering guidance, carrying out plans,                and encouraging others (Vera, 2016).                 Previous  research  explored  performance  phenomena  and  how  they  were  affected  by                numerous variables, such as  leadership and  its  varied  leadership  styles. Most studies  have                found that leadership styles in an organization significantly boost or reduce the performance                of the individuals in the business. The importance of a manager discovering their leadership                style is thus underlined. Supervisors and researchers are concerned about this leadership style                because  of  its  impact  on  subordinates,  who,  it  is  argued,  work  more  successfully  and                productively when their managers adopt a specific style (Ogunola, 2015).                  A fastfood manager's management style can either motivate or discourage staff, which can                either enhance or reduce their level of performance. Employing effective leadership styles to                motivate people results in higher quality and increased work performance (Hatter, 2015).                 In reality, improving employee performance benefits the firm in the long run. A  qualified,                skilled, and motivated employee significantly contributes to the organization's success. In this                aspect,  an organization's  performance  depends  on  the  leader's  capacity  to optimize  human                resources.  Furthermore,  a  competent  leader  recognizes  the  role  of  employees  in  attaining                organizational goals. As a result, personnel is critical to attaining these objectives (Solomon,                2016).                 This study aimed to determine managers' leadership styles correlated with employees' work                performance in selected fast food restaurants. This also determined the relationship between                managers' leadership styles and employee work performance.                 In view of the preceding statements, this study was conducted to:                     1.  Determine the demographic profiles of the respondents in terms of:                           a.

Tenure in the company;                    2.  Identify managers' leadership styles as perceived by employees of selected fast food                        restaurants;                    3.  Determine  work  performance  ratings  of  the  respondents  in  the  selected  fast  food                        restaurants;                    4.  Identifythe significant relationship between managers' leadership styles and employee                        work performance; and                    5.

The researcher considered 100 service crew                members from selected fastfood restaurants in Tanza, Cavite, for this study. The respondents                considered in the study were only those employees who have been employed for at least a                year to get a better review of the leadership styles of their immediate superiors. In addition,                the  recent  performance  record  of  the  employees  was  provided  by  the  selected  fastfood                restaurants. They were selected using purposive sampling. The researcher used an adapted                survey questionnaire administered thru Google forms to collect the data from service crew                members.                 After the data were gathered and tallied, different statistical tools and techniques were used.                     1.  The  percentage  and  frequency  count  was  used  to  determine  the  profile  of  the                        respondents in problem number 1 and work performance ratings in problem number                        3.                    2.  In problem number 2, a weighted mean was applied to determine the leadership styles                        of  managers  as  perceived  by  service  crew  members.  A  five-point  Likert  scale  was                        used in the questionnaire. The scale had the following pattern: 5 for to a very high                        extent; 4 for to a high extent; 3 for to a moderate extent; 2 for to some extent and 1 for                        none at all. Table 2 presents the conversion scale for interpreting the weighted mean.                  Table 1.

Regarding gender, out of 100                respondents, 53% are females while 47% are males. Regarding age, 57% of the respondents                are between 18-23 years old, 40% are 24-29 years old, and 3% are above 30 years old. This                means  that  most  respondents  are  between  18-23  years  old.  As  to  civil  status,  96% of  the                respondents  are  single,  and  4%  are  married.  As  to  educational  attainment,  out  of  100                respondents, 61% of them are college undergraduates, while 34% finished high school and                only 5% finished college level. As to tenure, there are 55% of the respondents have been with                the  company  for  1-2  years  now,  34% of them  have  been  with  the  company  for  3-4  years                already, and 11% of the respondents have been with the company for five years and above.                This means that most of the respondents have already been with the company for more than                1-2 years.                 Table 3.

Overall, the findings revealed that the majority of the respondents gave                the managers a high extent rating (3.84) on their leadership styles in terms of authoritative                style.                 The study by Olar (2016) reinforced that most fast food restaurant employees perceived their                managers  as  authoritative  leaders  as  they  believed  they  had  a  hands-on  approach  to                supervision. This includes demonstrating the task and telling them what to do in each of those                tasks.

Bunaan (2016) asserted that a participative leadership style is an effective option. Compared                to  other  typical  styles,  they  rarely  make  decisions;  leave  this  portion  to  the  employees.                Mostly, these leaders delegate responsibility to their employees and offer guidance to trusted                team  members.  Also,  Cole  (2016)  elaborated  that  this  leadership  style  positively  affects                employees as they feel power and confidence in doing their job.                 Table 5.

Generally, the findings revealed that the majority of the respondents gave                the managers a high degree  rating (4.03) on their leadership styles  in terms of democratic                style.                 Callejas (2016) confirmed the result of the study that employees in fast-food restaurants rated                an  overall  to  high  extent  the  democratic  leadership  of  their  managers.  Their  manager's                leadership style encourages the free exchange of ideas throughout the group, as all members                have an equally valued voice. This means that difficult issues are more easily addressed, and                better solutions are more likely to be found.                  Table 6.

The  findings  imply  that  managers'                authoritative leadership styles are attributed to the employees' good performances.                 A  study  conducted  about  the  impact  of  leadership  style  on  employee  performance  in  an                organization by Babatunde et al. (2015) revealed a significant relationship between leadership                style and employees' performance. This is in relation to the study of Abrifor et al. (2015) that                leadership styles had a significant relationship with employees' work performance.                 The findings that the authoritative leadership styles of managers are attributed to the good                performances of the employees was established by Duwason (2015) that the autocratic style                might show great results in a short period. However, excessive use of authority will distort                productivity  in  the  long  term.  People  either  get  bored  and  dissatisfied,  leave,  or  fall  into                repetitive tasks without creativity and innovation and become demotivated.                 Table  8.

This also determined the relationship between                managers'  leadership  styles  and  employee  work  performance.  Based  on  the  findings,  the                following conclusions were drawn:                     1.  Most  respondents are females, 18-23 years old, single, college undergraduates with                        one to two years of tenure in the company.                    2.  Participative leadership was the perceived leadership style of managers in the selected                        fastfood restaurants.                    3.  Most  of  the  respondents  were  rated  very  satisfactory  work  performance  by  their                        respective managers.                    4.  There  is  a  small  positive  relationship  between  the  autocratic  leadership  style  of                        managers and employees' work performance. The relationship  is significant. At the                        same time, managers' participative and democratic leadership styles have negligible                        negative  relationships  with  employees'  work  performances.  The  relationships  are                        significant.                    5.  There is no significant difference in the respondents' assessments regarding managers'                        leadership  styles  when  they  are  grouped  according  to  gender,  age,  civil  status,                        educational attainment, and tenure with the company.                 Based on the above conclusions, the following recommendations are made:                      1.  The study results can be used to create management development programs for fast-                        food restaurant managers.                    2.  Fast-food  restaurants  can  also  use  the  study  results  as  a  basis  for  an  intervention                        program for their employees.                   www.ijrehc.com                             Copyright © IJREHC 2022, All right reserved   Page 254","International Journal of Research in Education Humanities and Commerce                                                            Volume 03, Issue 05 \"September - October 2022\"                                                                                            ISSN 2583-0333                  REFERENCES                 Abrifor N., \&Anwa, S.
