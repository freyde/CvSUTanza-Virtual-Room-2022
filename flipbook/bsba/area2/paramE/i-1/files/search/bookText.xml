               ABSTRACT


               This  study  focused  on  determining  managers'  leadership  styles  correlated  with  employees'
               work  performance  in  selected  fast  food  restaurants.  This  also  determined  the  relationship
               between  managers'  leadership  styles  and  employee  work  performance.  It  employed  a
               descriptive research design using a survey questionnaire administered using Google forms.
               For this study, the researcher used the purposive sampling technique to consider 100 service
               crews from selected fast food restaurants in Tanza, Cavite. They have been employed for at
               least a year to review their immediate superior's leadership styles better. Data were tabulated
               and analyzed using SPSS. Results show that participative leadership style was the perceived
               leadership  style  of  managers  in  the  selected  fast  food  restaurants.  Also,  most  of  the
               respondents  were  rated  very  satisfactory  work  performance  by  their  respective  managers.
               Results also show a small positive relationship between the authoritative leadership style of
               managers and employees' work performance, and the relationship is significant. Results also
               reveal  that  while  managers'  participative  and  democratic  leadership  styles  have  negligible
               negative relationships with employees' work performances, the relationships are significant.
               Furthermore,  there  is  no  significant  difference  when  respondents'  views  of  managers'
               leadership  styles  are  classified  by  gender,  age,  civil  status,  educational  attainment,  and
               duration with the organization.

               Keywords: Leadership styles, work performance, fastfood restaurants


               1.0 INTRODUCTION

               Leadership  can  be  viewed  as  a  novel  and  effective  strategy  for  managing  individuals  and
               corporations. The old idea of Personnel Administration has increasingly given way to Human
               Resource Management to  emphasize the strategic  integration of  new  leadership styles  into
               successful  employee  management  and  to  increase  employee  performance.  To  satisfy  the
               demands of the context in which they operate, an effective leader must establish a good style.
               Different  leadership  styles  are  used  that  fit  employee  based  on  the  amount  of  direction,
               empowerment,  and  decision-making  power.  An  administrative  phenomenon  reflects  the
               contingency  of  leadership,  and  style,  situation,  and  performance  criteria  have  been  left  to
               suffocate  on  their  own.  As  a  result,  employee  performance  was  affected  due to  a  lack  of

               Leadership is the interpersonal process by which a leader influences, motivates, and enables
               others to contribute to the effectiveness and success of the organization to which they belong.
               Furthermore, leadership style  is defined as a person's behavior pattern when attempting to
               influence others. It is also the way and approach to delivering guidance, carrying out plans,
               and encouraging others (Vera, 2016).

               Previous  research  explored  performance  phenomena  and  how  they  were  affected  by
               numerous variables, such as  leadership and  its  varied  leadership  styles. Most studies  have
               found that leadership styles in an organization significantly boost or reduce the performance
               of the individuals in the business. The importance of a manager discovering their leadership
               style is thus underlined. Supervisors and researchers are concerned about this leadership style
               because  of  its  impact  on  subordinates,  who,  it  is  argued,  work  more  successfully  and
               productively when their managers adopt a specific style (Ogunola, 2015).


               A fastfood manager's management style can either motivate or discourage staff, which can
               either enhance or reduce their level of performance. Employing effective leadership styles to
               motivate people results in higher quality and increased work performance (Hatter, 2015).

               In reality, improving employee performance benefits the firm in the long run. A  qualified,
               skilled, and motivated employee significantly contributes to the organization's success. In this
               aspect,  an organization's  performance  depends  on  the  leader's  capacity  to optimize  human
               resources.  Furthermore,  a  competent  leader  recognizes  the  role  of  employees  in  attaining
               organizational goals. As a result, personnel is critical to attaining these objectives (Solomon,
               2016).

               This study aimed to determine managers' leadership styles correlated with employees' work
               performance in selected fast food restaurants. This also determined the relationship between
               managers' leadership styles and employee work performance.

               In view of the preceding statements, this study was conducted to:

                   1.  Determine the demographic profiles of the respondents in terms of:
                          a.  Age;
                          b.  Gender;
                          c.  Civil Status;
                          d.  Educational Attainment; and
                          e.  Tenure in the company;
                   2.  Identify managers' leadership styles as perceived by employees of selected fast food
                       restaurants;
                   3.  Determine  work  performance  ratings  of  the  respondents  in  the  selected  fast  food
                       restaurants;
                   4.  Identifythe significant relationship between managers' leadership styles and employee
                       work performance; and
                   5.  Determinethe  significant  difference  in  respondents'  assessments  when  grouped
                       according to their demographic profiles.

               The  study  used  the  descriptive  research  method  in  describing  the  characteristics  of  the
               respondents,  the  leadership  styles  of  managers  in  correlation  to  employees'  work
               performance,  the  significant  relationship  between  the  manager's  leadership  styles  and
               employee work performance, and the significant difference in respondents' ratings when they
               are classified based on their demographic profile. The researcher considered 100 service crew
               members from selected fastfood restaurants in Tanza, Cavite, for this study. The respondents
               considered in the study were only those employees who have been employed for at least a
               year to get a better review of the leadership styles of their immediate superiors. In addition,
               the  recent  performance  record  of  the  employees  was  provided  by  the  selected  fastfood
               restaurants. They were selected using purposive sampling. The researcher used an adapted
               survey questionnaire administered thru Google forms to collect the data from service crew
               members.

               After the data were gathered and tallied, different statistical tools and techniques were used.

                   1.  The  percentage  and  frequency  count  was  used  to  determine  the  profile  of  the
                       respondents in problem number 1 and work performance ratings in problem number
                       3.
                   2.  In problem number 2, a weighted mean was applied to determine the leadership styles
                       of  managers  as  perceived  by  service  crew  members.  A  five-point  Likert  scale  was
                       used in the questionnaire. The scale had the following pattern: 5 for to a very high
                       extent; 4 for to a high extent; 3 for to a moderate extent; 2 for to some extent and 1 for
                       none at all. Table 2 presents the conversion scale for interpreting the weighted mean.

               3.0 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

               3.1 Demographic Profiles of the Participants


               Table 3 shows the  demographic profiles of the  participants. Regarding gender, out of 100
               respondents, 53% are females while 47% are males. Regarding age, 57% of the respondents
               are between 18-23 years old, 40% are 24-29 years old, and 3% are above 30 years old. This
               means  that  most  respondents  are  between  18-23  years  old.  As  to  civil  status,  96% of  the
               respondents  are  single,  and  4%  are  married.  As  to  educational  attainment,  out  of  100
               respondents, 61% of them are college undergraduates, while 34% finished high school and
               only 5% finished college level. As to tenure, there are 55% of the respondents have been with
               the  company  for  1-2  years  now,  34% of them  have  been  with  the  company  for  3-4  years
               already, and 11% of the respondents have been with the company for five years and above.
               This means that most of the respondents have already been with the company for more than
               1-2 years.

               3.2 Leadership Styles of the Managers

               Table 4 shows the respondents' assessments of the  managers'  leadership styles  in terms of
               authoritative style. Overall, the findings revealed that the majority of the respondents gave
               the managers a high extent rating (3.84) on their leadership styles in terms of authoritative
               style.

               The study by Olar (2016) reinforced that most fast food restaurant employees perceived their
               managers  as  authoritative  leaders  as  they  believed  they  had  a  hands-on  approach  to
               supervision. This includes demonstrating the task and telling them what to do in each of those
               tasks. The respondents also rated their managers to a high extent in giving them threats with
               punishment for them to follow their orders and avoid mistakes.

               Table 5 shows the respondents' assessments of the  managers'  leadership styles  in terms of
               participative  styles.  Overall,  the  findings  revealed  that  most  of  the  respondents  gave  the
               managers a very high extent rating (4.23) on their leadership styles in terms of participative
               style.

               Bunaan (2016) asserted that a participative leadership style is an effective option. Compared
               to  other  typical  styles,  they  rarely  make  decisions;  leave  this  portion  to  the  employees.
               Mostly, these leaders delegate responsibility to their employees and offer guidance to trusted
               team  members.  Also,  Cole  (2016)  elaborated  that  this  leadership  style  positively  affects
               employees as they feel power and confidence in doing their job.

               Table 6 shows the respondents' assessments of the  managers'  leadership styles  in terms of
               democratic styles. Generally, the findings revealed that the majority of the respondents gave
               the managers a high degree  rating (4.03) on their leadership styles  in terms of democratic
               style.

               Callejas (2016) confirmed the result of the study that employees in fast-food restaurants rated
               an  overall  to  high  extent  the  democratic  leadership  of  their  managers.  Their  manager's
               leadership style encourages the free exchange of ideas throughout the group, as all members
               have an equally valued voice. This means that difficult issues are more easily addressed, and
               better solutions are more likely to be found.

               Table 7 summarizes the performance ratings of the respondents. The data showed that 48% of
               the respondents were rated very satisfactorily (4.00) by their respective  managers, 28% of
               them  were  rated  satisfactory  in  performance  (3.00),  21%  of  the  respondents  were  rated
               outstanding  by  their  respective  managers  (5.00)  and  3  of  the  respondents  are  poor  in
               performance  (2.00)  respectively.  This  suggests  that  the  majority  of  respondents'  managers
               assessed their work performances as highly satisfactory.

               authoritative leadership styles are attributed to the employees' good performances.

               A  study  conducted  about  the  impact  of  leadership  style  on  employee  performance  in  an
               organization by Babatunde et al. (2015) revealed a significant relationship between leadership
               style and employees' performance. This is in relation to the study of Abrifor et al. (2015) that
               leadership styles had a significant relationship with employees' work performance.

               The findings that the authoritative leadership styles of managers are attributed to the good
               performances of the employees was established by Duwason (2015) that the autocratic style
               might show great results in a short period. However, excessive use of authority will distort
               productivity  in  the  long  term.  People  either  get  bored  and  dissatisfied,  leave,  or  fall  into
               repetitive tasks without creativity and innovation and become demotivated.

               4.0 CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

               This  study  determined  managers'  leadership  styles  correlated  with  employees'  work
               performance in selected fastfood restaurants. This also determined the relationship between
               managers'  leadership  styles  and  employee  work  performance.  Based  on  the  findings,  the
               following conclusions were drawn:

                   1.  Most  respondents are females, 18-23 years old, single, college undergraduates with
                       one to two years of tenure in the company.
                   2.  Participative leadership was the perceived leadership style of managers in the selected
                       fastfood restaurants.
                   3.  Most  of  the  respondents  were  rated  very  satisfactory  work  performance  by  their
                       respective managers.
                   4.  There  is  a  small  positive  relationship  between  the  autocratic  leadership  style  of
                       managers and employees' work performance. The relationship  is significant. At the
                       same time, managers' participative and democratic leadership styles have negligible
                       negative  relationships  with  employees'  work  performances.  The  relationships  are
                       significant.
                   5.  There is no significant difference in the respondents' assessments regarding managers'
                       leadership  styles  when  they  are  grouped  according  to  gender,  age,  civil  status,
                       educational attainment, and tenure with the company.

               Based on the above conclusions, the following recommendations are made:


                   1.  The study results can be used to create management development programs for fast-
                       food restaurant managers.
                   2.  Fast-food  restaurants  can  also  use  the  study  results  as  a  basis  for  an  intervention
                       program for their employees.
