                              Economics is the study of the proper allocation and efficient use of scarce resources
                       to produce commodities for the satisfaction of unlimited needs and wants of man. It has two
                       branches: microeconomics and macroeconomics. Microeconomics deals with the behavior of
                       individual  components  such  as  household,  firm,  and  individual  owner  of  production  while
                       macroeconomics study the economy as a whole.
                              This  module  is  for  business  management  students  who  are  taking  a  course  in
                       microeconomics. It aims to provide relative information to understand the economic behavior

                       of individuals, household, and firm in making economic choices. Economics, as a whole, can
                       add knowledge for students who want to become successful entrepreneurs in the future. If they
                       will establish their own business, aside from the basics of how to manage your own business,
                       they need to know how the economy works, starting from the individual components, as their
                       business will be part of it.
                              The  topics  included  in  this  module  are  the  art  and  science  of  economic  analysis,

                       economic tools, and economic systems. Demand and supply, the fundamental and powerful
                       economic tool, its elasticity to price change, consumer and producer behavior, as well as the
                       market structures are also included.
                              May  the  students  who  will  use  this  module  find  microeconomics  challenging  and
                       interesting.

                      The main objective of this learning guide is to present a given hypothetical situation in
               terms of numerical values. Quantitative analysis helps in evaluating performance, assessing
               financial  instruments,  and  making  predictions.  It  encompasses  three  main  techniques  of
               measuring data: regression analysis, linear programming, and data mining.

                      This module will introduce to you the importance of quantitative techniques in solving
               managerial problems.   It helps  you understand the step-by-step process in the quantitative
               approach. It generally aims to perform a review analysis of a business model case study and
               assess the potential effectiveness of the solution methodology.
