I.  BASIC POLICIES                     1.  The  University shall establish its own employee suggestions and incentive awards                        system.                     2.  The   System shall  be designed  to  encourage creativity,  innovativeness,  efficiency,                        integrity and productivity in the public service by recognizing and rewarding officials                        and employees, individually or in groups for their suggestions, inventions, superior                        accomplishments  and  other  personal  efforts  which  contribute  to  the  efficiency,                        economy or other improvement in government operations, or for other extraordinary                        acts or services in the public interest.                     3.  The  CvSU PRAISE shall adhere to the principle of providing incentives and awards                        based on performance, innovative ideas, and exemplary behavior.                     4.  The  CvSU  PRAISE  shall  give  emphasis  on  the  timeliness  of  giving  award  or                        recognition.  Aside  from  conferment  of  awards  during  the  traditional  or  planned                        awarding  ceremonies,  the  spirit  of  on-the-spot  grant  of  recognition  shall  be                        institutionalized.                     5.

For this purpose, the CvSU PRAISE shall encourage the grant of non-monetary                           awards. Monetary awards shall be granted only when the suggestions, inventions,                           superior accomplishments, and other personal efforts result in monetary savings                           which shall not exceed 20% of the savings generated.                     6.

The  PRAISE  Committee shall  establish its  own  internal  procedures  and strategies                        which may  be  independent  from  but not  contrary  to  CSC established  rules  as  the                        committee deems applicable.

Committee –  refers to the designated CvSU PRAISE Committee.                           Contribution  –  any  input  which  can  be  in  the  form  of  an  idea,  invention,  or                          performance. (See also Idea type and Performance type contribution)                           Discovery – is the uncovering of something previously existing but found or learned                          for the first time which will improve public service delivery.                           Equal  Opportunity  Principles  (EOP)  -  arises  from  the  similar  treatment  of  all                          people, unhampered by artificial barriers or prejudices or preferences, except when                          particular distinctions can be explicitly justified (Jonsen, et.al 2015); an ideal state in                          which everyone has the same chance to participate and succeed in any aspect of                          their work and lives (Westen, 1985).

(ILO, 2000)                           Gender Identity - is a person's internal feelings of being a woman, man, both, or                          neither. Most people have a gender identity and/or gender expression (how a person                          shows their gender through their appearance or behavior) that matches their sex                          assigned  at  birth.  However,  some  people  have  a  gender  identity  or  gender                          expression that is different from their sex assigned at birth; these people might use                          the term \"transgender\" or \"gender non-conforming\" to describe their gender identity.

Incentive – monetary or non-monetary motivation or privilege given to an official or                          employee  for  contributions,  suggestions,  inventions,  ideas,  satisfactory                          accomplishment,  or  demonstration  of  exemplary  behavior  based  on  agreed                          performance standards and norms of behavior.                           Invention – the creation of something previously non-existent which will benefit the                          government.                           Non-Career – positions expressly declared by law to be in the non-career service,                          or those whose entrance in the service is characterized by (1) entrance on bases                          other than those of the usual tests of merit and fitness for the career service and (2)                          tenure which is limited to the duration of a particular project for which purpose of                          employment was made.

INTRODUCTION                         A. Historical Background of CvSU                                CvSU had its humble beginnings  in 1906 as the Indang Intermediate School                        with the  American Thomasites  as the  first  teachers. Several transformations in  the                        name of the school took place: Indang Farm School in 1918, Indang Rural High School                        in  1927,  and  Don  Severino  National  Agriculture  School  in  1958.  The  name  Don                        Severino is  in  honor  of Don Severino de  las  Alas  who served as  the  Secretary of                        Interior in the Aguinaldo revolutionary government. Don Severino donated a tract of                        land for use as a field laboratory by the School.  In 1964, the School was converted                        into a State College by virtue of Republic Act No. 3917 and became known as Don                        Severino Agricultural College (DSAC).                                On January 22, 1998, by virtue of Republic Act No. 8468, DSAC was converted                        into  Cavite  State  University (CvSU). Two  years  later,  the  Commission  on  Higher                        Education (CHED) designated the University as Center of Development in Agriculture                        and Agricultural Engineering.                                Cavite College of Fisheries (CACOF) in Naic, Cavite and Cavite College of Arts                        and Trade  (CCAT) in Rosario,  Cavite were integrated  to the University by virtue of                        CHED Memorandum No. 27, s. 2000.                                Since  then,  additional  campuses  in  the  province  were  established  through                        memoranda of agreement with the LGUs.

B.  University Vision and Mission                                The University envisages itself as “The premier university in historic Cavite                        recognized  for  excellence  in  the  development  of  globally  competitive  and                        morally upright individuals”. In consonance with this vision, it is the mission of the                        University “to provide excellent, equitable, and relevant educational opportunities                        in the arts, sciences and technology through quality instruction and responsive                        research and development activities”.                            CvSU – Strategic Performance Management System (Revision 1)                       1","The  University “shall  produce  professional,  skilled  and  morally  upright                        individuals for global competitiveness”.                        C.  CvSU Strategic Sectoral Matrix                                The  CvSU  Strategic  Sectoral  Matrix  (Figure1)  serves  as  a  roadmap  that                        visualizes  the  performance of the  University. It  shows  how  it  creates  value  in  the                        accomplishment of the Key Result  Areas  attuned  with the  set  Major Final  Outputs                        (MFOs)  of  the  institution.  These  MFOs  including  Higher  Education  Programs,                        Advanced  Education  Programs,  Research  Programs,  and  Technical  Advisory                        Programs, as well as General Administrative Services and  Support to Operation serve                        as  measures  if  the  University  is  realizing  its  Organizational  Outcomes,  namely:                        relevant and quality tertiary education ensured to achieve inclusive growth and access                        of deserving but poor students to quality tertiary education increased; higher education                        research improved to promote economic productivity and innovation; and community                        engagement increased. These above-stated organizational  outcomes will gauge the                        effectiveness of the University in fulfilling the expected Sectoral Outcomes of lifelong                        learning opportunities  for all ensured.

Rationale                                Cavite State University recognizes the importance of employees in achieving                        its organizational goals. It considers their faculty members and employees as strategic                        assets who must be continuously enhanced for them to stay committed in producing                        outstanding  work performances. As their level of productivity increases, it also helps                        improve the educational institution’s performance in achieving its goals and objectives.                                As  a higher  public  educational  institution,  CvSU must attract, motivate and                        retain competent administrators, faculty members and employees in performing their                        tri-fold functions of instruction, research and extension and in executing their unique                        role  of providing  access to education  to the  least  advantaged  individuals  in  areas                        where there are few private schools and in offering priority programs necessary for                        national development.                                To  make  sure  that  the  university  will  uphold  the  highest  standards  of                        performances of all its faculty members and employees, the establishment of a sound                        performance  evaluation  system  shall  be  administered  to  continually  foster  the                        improvement  of  individual  employee  efficiency and  organizational  effectiveness                        through the Strategic Performance Management System (SPMS).                                SPMS is focused on linking individual performance vis-à-vis the vision, mission                        and strategic goals of the university. It will be the tool for ensuring that the functions of                        the various colleges/campuses and units and their faculty members and employees                        are fulfilled as expected based on the set standards of the institution.                                It  will  also  serve  as  a  mechanism  to  ensure  that  employees  achieve  the                        objectives  set  by the  University.    On the  other  hand,  CvSU will  then  achieve  the                        objectives that it has  set itself in its strategic plan. Thus,  performance management                        function will  become the  heart of the CvSU human resource management system.

Performance Planning and Commitment utilizes the top-bottom approach with                        the management setting the direction of the organization through strategic/operational                        planning considering the mandate of the institution and other relevant factors. With all                        the inputs essential to the decision, the University then sets targets to contribute to the                        realization  of the  directions  set  and  distributes  the  targets  to  various  units  of  the                        University for the preparation and submission of their Office Performance Commitment                        and Review (OPCR). Each unit will then consider the human resources they have and                        the  terms  of  reference  of  each  employee  to  be  able  to  prepare  and  submit  the                        Individual  Performance Commitment and Review (IPCR). Good planning and clear                        setting of tasks are two valuable keys in the improvement of performance.                            CvSU – Strategic Performance Management System (Revision 1)                      13","Monitoring  is as  important as planning,  hence, Performance Monitoring  and                        Coaching utilizing a bottom-top approach is necessary. Individual performances are to                        be monitored by immediate supervisors. Submission of monthly and quarterly M and                        E reports are also to be done before the submission  of the accomplished IPCR that                        will be the basis for the accomplished OPCR to be submitted.                                Submitted IPCRs and  OPCRs have  to be  reviewed and  assessed  to  verify                        accuracy and  validity  of  inputs  before  submitting  the  accomplished  IPCRs  to  the                        Human Resource Development Office and the accomplished OPCRs to the Planning                        Office. Analysis of such documents could be used for proper intervention that will help                        in the enhancement of performances. Copies of IPCR and OPCR with ratings will then                        be distributed and given back to their respective owners.                                Excellent performances also deserve to be rewarded and be used for further                        development  plans.  Ratings  have  to  be  evaluated  for  incentive  purposes  until                        deserving employees are given awards and other incentives through PRAISE. Such                        rewards do not only motivate employees but also build a healthy working environment                        that encourages excellence.                                When implemented  efficiently, SPMS is  believed to  be of great contribution                        towards an improved organizational  performance.                                The  CvSU Strategic  Performance Management System are  subdivided  into                        four  stages,  namely:  Stage  1.  Performance Planning  and  Commitment; Stage  2.                        Performance Monitoring and Coaching; Stage 3.  Performance Review and Evaluation;                        and Stage 4.

The Planning  Office shall  provide each Office with the Final  assessment  to                        serve  as  basis  of  offices  in  the  assessment  of  individual  faculty  members  and                        employees.                         B. Performance Assessment for Individual Employees                                The immediate supervisor shall  assess  individual  performance based  on the                        commitments made at the beginning  of the rating period. The performance rating is                        based  solely  on the  records of accomplishments, hence, there is  no need  for self-                        rating.  The  supervisor  shall  indicate  qualitative  comments,  observations,  and                        recommendations in the IPCR to include behavior and critical incidents that may be                        considered for other human resource development purposes such as promotion and                        other interventions. Said assessment shall be discussed with the concerned individual                        prior to the submission of IPCR to the HRDO.                                SPMS puts  premium  on  the  major  final  outputs  of  the  University  towards                        realization  of the  University vision  and  mission.  Hence, rating  for planned  and  /or                        intervening tasks shall always be supported by reports, documents or any outputs as                        proof of actual performance. In the absence of the said  bases  or proof, a particular                        task shall not be rated and shall be disregarded.                                The  supervisor  shall  indicate  qualitative  comments,  observations  and                        recommendations  in  the  performance  commitment  and  review  form.  Employee                        assessment results shall be discussed by the supervisor with the concerned ratee prior                        to  the  submission  of the  individual  employee’s  commitment and  review  form. The                        discussion  shall  focus on the strengths,  competency-related performance gaps  and                        opportunities to address these gaps, career paths and alternatives.                                The  performance  of  intervening  or  additional  activity/ies  shall  be  duly                        considered  especially  if these  were done  simultaneously  with the  planned  targets.                        Intervening  activities  are  those  which  are  neither  inherent  nor  directly  related  to                        employee’s plantilla  or designated  positions  and may include membership in ad hoc                           CvSU – Strategic Performance Management System (Revision 1)                      19","committees, research  work  and  other  assignments  which  will  require  considerable                        effort and time of the employees and are duly covered by an office order.                                The  Dean  and  Directors  shall  determine  the  final  assessment  of  the                        performance level of the individual employees using the five-point rating scale (1 to 5),                        5 being the highest and 1, the lowest as shown in Table 2.                                     The average of all  individual  performance assessments  shall  not  go higher                        than the collective performance assessment of the office.                                The deans  and directors shall ensure that the employee is notified of his/her                        final performance assessment. The summary List of individual ratings with the attached                        accomplished forms are submitted to the HRDO within the prescribed period.                                For faculty members, their individual performances shall  be evaluated based                        on their academic rank and /or their designation as indicated in Appendix F. For those                        with  major  designations  including  deans,  directors,  unit  heads  and  department                        chairman, 25% of their performance shall be derived from their Core Functions and                        75% shall be obtained from their strategic priority functions.                                However, faculty members, whose designations  are included in the Board of                        Regents approved University Workload System which are paid shall be expected to                        perform 100% of Core Functions of Faulty Members based on Academic Bank.                                 Moreover,  the  teaching  effectiveness  of  the  faculty  members  including                         commitment, knowledge of the subject matter, teaching for independent learning and                         management  of  (Appendix  G-1)  as  well  as  Research  effectiveness for  clientele                         satisfaction, leadership and partnership development (Appendix G-2 \&3) shall also be                         assessed to measure the quality and efficiency of work performances using the five-                         point scale (Tables 2 and 3).
