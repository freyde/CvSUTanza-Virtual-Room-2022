                           REVISED  PROGRAM ON AWARDS AND INCENTIVES FOR SERVICE
                                              EXCELLENCE (CvSU- PRAISE)

                   In line with the Revised Policies on Employee Suggestions and Incentives Awards System
                   (ESIAS) provided under CSC Resolution No. 01-0112 and CSC MC No. 01, s. 2001, CSC
                   MC 6, s. 2002, CSC MC 18, s. 2012, EO 201, s. 2016, and CSC MC No. 01, s. 2019,  the
                   University  adopts  the  herein  Revised  Program  on  Awards  and  Incentives  for  Service
                   Excellence (PRAISE) to be referred to as CvSU PRAISE.


                   I.  BASIC POLICIES

                   1.  The  University shall establish its own employee suggestions and incentive awards
                       system.

                   2.  The   System shall  be designed  to  encourage creativity,  innovativeness,  efficiency,
                       integrity and productivity in the public service by recognizing and rewarding officials
                       and employees, individually or in groups for their suggestions, inventions, superior
                       accomplishments  and  other  personal  efforts  which  contribute  to  the  efficiency,
                       economy or other improvement in government operations, or for other extraordinary
                       acts or services in the public interest.

                   3.  The  CvSU PRAISE shall adhere to the principle of providing incentives and awards
                       based on performance, innovative ideas, and exemplary behavior.

                   4.  The  CvSU  PRAISE  shall  give  emphasis  on  the  timeliness  of  giving  award  or
                       recognition.  Aside  from  conferment  of  awards  during  the  traditional  or  planned
                       awarding  ceremonies,  the  spirit  of  on-the-spot  grant  of  recognition  shall  be
                       institutionalized.

                   5.  The  CvSU  PRAISE  shall  provide  both  monetary  and  non-monetary  awards  and
                       incentives to recognized, acknowledge and reward productive, creative,  innovative,
                       and ethical behavior of employees through formal and informal mode.

                          For this purpose, the CvSU PRAISE shall encourage the grant of non-monetary
                          awards. Monetary awards shall be granted only when the suggestions, inventions,
                          superior accomplishments, and other personal efforts result in monetary savings
                          which shall not exceed 20% of the savings generated.

                   6.  The PRAISE shall be institutionalized through the creation of a PRAISE Committee.


                   7.  The PRAISE Committee shall ensure that productivity, innovative ideas, suggestions,
                       and exemplary behavior can be identified, considered, managed, and implemented on
                       a continuing basis to cover employees at all levels.


                   8.  The  PRAISE  Committee shall  establish its  own  internal  procedures  and strategies
                       which may  be  independent  from  but not  contrary  to  CSC established  rules  as  the
                       committee deems applicable. Membership in the Committee shall be considered part
                       of the member’s regular duties and functions.

                   9.  The University shall submit this CvSU PRAISE and its subsequent amendments to the
                       CSCRO IV. The Civil Service Commission Regional Office No. IV and/or CSC Cavite
                       Field Office shall provide technical assistance, if deemed necessary, to ensure proper
                       implementation
                                                                                                  Page 1 of 23]]></page><page Index="11"><![CDATA[MERIT PROMOTION
