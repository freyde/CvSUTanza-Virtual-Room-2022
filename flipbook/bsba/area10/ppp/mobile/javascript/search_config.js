By its records, an agency authenticates and keeps                 track of its day to day activities.  Records also provide the                 material  for  planners  and  implementers  of  future                operations.    Hence,  the  management  and  tracking  of                 records should be properly operated to better achieve one                 of  the  primary  functions  of  modern  day  organization  –                getting the right information, from the right person at the                 right time and at a reasonable cost.  Moreover, to ensure                 the effectiveness of this function, proper system in records                keeping  and  records  tracking  are  necessary.    The                 processing,  use,  maintenance,  storage  and  retrieval  of                 these records are to be monitored closely.

It  assigns                 reference number for each document received to identify                the  communication  and  the  date  of  receipt  as  well  as  to                 facilitate  recording  and  location  of  communication.                 Moreover, it facilitates the fast transmission and routing of                communication  to  the  next  action  unit.    It  authenticates,                 classifies,  indexes,  and  files  official  documents  of  the                 university.  It is also responsible for the disposing papers                that are no longer needed in accordance with the existing                         Area X: Administration                                                        265","PROGRAM PERFORMANCE PROFILE                                                         BSBA                   rules  and  regulations.    It  also  monitors  the  weekly                 accomplishment  of  administrative  personnel  and  submits                 reports  to  OVPASS.    Finally,  it  provides  accurate                information  on  the  exact  location    or  status  of  document                 within the offices of the administration.                   The  person  in  charge  of  the  records  office  is  the  Records                 Officer  who  is  responsible  for  recording  and  tracking  of                 documents received and released in the university.                   There  are  two  major  classifications  of  documents  in  the                 existing system.  These are correspondence and financial                documents.  These documents are entirely different from                 each other, thus, they are recorded on separate logbooks.                    On  the  other  hand,  correspondence  are  written                communications which are further classified into incoming                 and  outgoing  communication  (See  Figure  8).    Incoming                 communications are those coming from outside the office                 while  outgoing  communications  are  those  that  originate                from the office.                   FLOW OF COMMUNICATION                   Incoming documents are forwarded to the Records Office                 for        evaluation,            stamping             and         assignment              of                document/reference number.  Documents are stamped with                 date received and initialed by the receiving personnel. (See                 Figure 8.1).  Important information about the document is                 recorded in the logbook including the origin, the particulars                        Area X: Administration                                                        266","PROGRAM PERFORMANCE PROFILE                                                         BSBA                   of the request, the date of receipt, the office sent to and the                 date of release. (See Figure 8.2).  The communication is                 forwarded  to  OVPASS  or  OVPAA  for  recommending                approval  depending  upon  the  nature  of  the  incoming                 communication.  Documents that are academic in nature                 are  forwarded  to  OVPAA  while  documents  that  are                administrative  in  nature  are  forwarded  to  OVPASS  for                 appropriate action.  Before signing however, the documents                 are checked if they are in order.  In the event that there is a                need for some clarification, or there are some requirements                 that need to be complied with, OVPAA/OVPASS send back                 the  communication  to  the  Records  Office.    The  Records                Office in turn, sends the communication back to the origin                 after the date of release and remark/notation of the signing                 officer has been recorded in the logbook.  After complying                with  the  remarks/requirements,  the  document  is  then                 returned  to  the  Records  Office,  after  which  the  same                 document  will  be  transmitted  to  OVPAA/OVPASS  for                recommending approval and finally to the OP for approval.                    Upon  approval,  the  communication  is  returned  to  the                 Records Office wherein the same shall be released to the                office,  individual  concerned  after  such  action  of  the                 document has been recorded in the logbook including the                 date of release. (See Figure                8).                   FINANCIAL DOCUMENTS                             Area X: Administration                                                        267","PROGRAM PERFORMANCE PROFILE                                                         BSBA                    Included  in  financial  documents  are  Request  and  Issue                 Voucher (RIV), Request for Allotment (ROA), Disbursement                 Voucher (DV), and Payroll.

Upon submission to the                Records  Office,  the  Records  Officer  evaluates  all  the                 documents (See Figure 7.1).  All required signatures and                 required  documents  are  scrutinized  as  to  completeness.                RIV with incomplete requirements are sent back to origin.                 After  ascertaining  the  completeness  of  requirements,  the                 same  is  acknowledges  receipt  by  indicating  the  date  of                 receipt  as  well  as  the  initial  of  the  receiver  (see  Figure                7.1.1).  A reference number is assigned to each document.                 Other  necessary  information  such  as  the  origin,  date                 received,  particulars,  total  amount  and  requisitioner  or                claimant  are  then  recorded  in  the  financial  logbook  (see                 figure 7.1.2).  A routing slip is attached to the  document                 where the tracking information is recorded.  Date of receipt                and  release  in  each  of  the  offices  where  documents  are                 forwarded are clearly indicated in the routing slip.                      After recording the needed information about the                 financial document on hand, it is forwarded to the Supply                  Office.  As aforementioned, the receiving personnel                  indicate the date of receipt on the Routing Slip.

The date of release, any remarks about                the  document  and  the  office  where  it  originated  were                 recorded in the Routing Slip and eventually the funded RIV                 and ROA are forwarded to the Supply Office for canvassing.                   The  Supply  Office  facilitates  the  serving  of  approved                 PO/WO to winning bidders (see figure 7.6).  The supplier                delivers the items and the designated inspectors check the                 items according to specifications indicated in the RIV.

The life and records may be likened to the life of a                         man.  A man is born, lives an active life and later retires                          and dies.  A record is created, maintained and later                          stored and disposed.                                 Thus, there are three phases of Records Management:                               a) Records creation (birth)                                    It  is  the  phase  of  organizational  operations                                where  exchange  of  written  communications                                 between  two  sources  thereby  starting  the  life                                 cycle of the record.  This may be in form of either:                                  1.  Incoming communications coming from outside the                                       office                                   2.

The                accounting  department  of  the  University  monitors  and                 audits  the  financial  status  of  the  plans  and  programs.                 However, the Budget Officer of the University records every                disbursement  for  each  project/unit  and  annotates  the                 Purchase  Request  Forms  to  indicate  availability  of  funds                 and from which funds the purchases are to be credited.                          The Planning and Development Office (PDO) serves                 as the monitoring and coordinating  arm for all plans and                 projects in the University. Although planning activities are                independently undertaken by the different units, each unit                 is required to submit quarterly progress reports to PDO. The                 planning officers of each unit submit their progress reports                to their respective Deans concerned, which in tum endorses                 the  progress  reports  to  the  Office  of  the  Director.  This                 enables the Planning and Development Office to keep track                of ongoing projects for monitoring and evaluation.                         One  major  activity  to  facilitate  the  monitoring  and                 evaluation purposes is the holding of the Annual Planning                In-house Review.

The Planning                             Office  shall  provide  each  Office  with  Final                             assessment  to  serve  as  basis  of  offices  in  the                            assessment  of  individual  faculty  members  and                             employees.                            b)  Performance Assessment for Individual Employees                                 The immediate supervisor shall assess individual                             performance  based  on  the  commitments  made  at                             the beginning of the rating period.  The performance                            rating  is  based  solely  on  the  records  of                             accomplishments, hence, there is no need for self-                             rating.                                 SPMS puts premium on the major final outputs of                             the University towards realization of the University                            vision  and  mission.    Hence,  rating  for  planned                             and/or intervening tasks shall always be supported                             by  reports,  documents  or  any  outputs  as  proof  of                            actual  performance.    In  the  absence  of  the  said                             bases of proof, a particular task shall not be rated                             and shall be disregarded.

CvSU-STRATEGIC PERFORMANCE                 MANAGEMENT SYSTEM                  A. Rationale                           Cavite  State  University  recognizes  the  importance  of                 employees in achieving is organizational goals. It considers                their faculty members and employees as strategic assets who                 must continuously enhanced for them to stay committed in                 producing outstanding work performances. As their level of                productivity increases, it also helps improve the educational                 institution’s  performance  in  achieving  its  goals  and                 objectives.                          As a higher public educational institution, CvSU must                 attract,  motivate  and  retain  competent  administrators,                 faculty members and employees in performing their tri-fold                functions  of  instruction,  research  and  extension  in                 executing their unique role of providing access to education                        Area X: Administration                                                         365","PROGRAM PERFORMANCE PROFILE                                                         BSBA                   to the least advantaged individuals in areas where there are                 few  private  schools  and  in  offering  priority  programs                 necessary for national development.                          To make sure that the university will uphold the highest                 standards of performances of all its faculty members and                employees,  the  establishment  of  a  sound  performance                 evaluation  system  shall  be  administered  to  continually                 foster  the  improvement  of  individual  employee  efficiency                and  organizational  effectiveness  through  the  Strategic                 Performance Management System (SPMS).                          SPMS is focused on linking individual performance vis-                 à-vis  the  vision,  mission  and  strategic  goals  of  the                 university. It will be the tool for ensuring that the functions                 of the various colleges/campuses and units and their faculty                members and employees are fulfilled as expressed based                 on the set standards of the institution.                           It  will  also  serve  as  a  mechanism  to  ensure  that                employees achieve the objectives set by the University. On                 the other hand, CvSU will then achieve the objectives that                 it  has  set  itself  in  its  strategic  plan.  Thus,  performance                management function will become the heart of the CvSU                 human resource management system. Information that will                 be derived from it will be useful in human resource planning,                management  and  decision  making  processes  of  Cavite                 State University.
