The University               is paying close to Php 2.0M a month to our service provider for our average energy consumption.               This is huge, and we are classified as big consumer with that amount.                      Along this line, the following conservation measures shall be implemented to support the               endeavor of the government without sacrificing the quality of services that we are providing to our               clients;                    1.  The use of AC units shall start at 9:00 in the morning until 4:00 in the afternoon.  Just use                       electric fans before 9:00 AM and after 4:00 PM to improve ventilation in the room.                    2.  If there is only skeleton force reporting in the office, it is encouraged to use only electric                       fan.                    3.  Switch on the light if necessary only.                    4.  Please use our water judiciously, and report to PPS all leaks in the water supply lines of                       your respective offices.                    5.  Building custodians are requested to regularly conduct inspection and report all defective                       electrical and water fixtures to PPS.                    6.  All units are encouraged to implement their own austerity measures in their respective                       units regarding the use of energy-consuming devices during office hours.                    7.  Please be reminded that all savings in the use of utilities will be plowed back to augment                       the income of the University, and for the benefits of all employees.                    8.  These measures shall be implemented immediately.                    9.  Please be guided accordingly.                    10. Thank you.
