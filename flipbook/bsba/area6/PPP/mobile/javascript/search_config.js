The population explosion in Brgy. Bagtas has                     led  to  an  initiative  to  alleviate  poverty  in  the                     barangay.  Brgy. Bagtas, having the most number                     of  populations  in  Tanza  (20,370  out  of  188,755),                     has  been  the  site  for  relocation  and  reclamation.                     However, people, who were displaced out of their                     previous  addresses,  were  relocated  in  the  said                      barangay without having a regular source of living.                     Some of them could not find a decent job because                     they  lack  the  educational  and  other  requirements                     for the job that they were applying for.  Others could                     not start any business because they lack the skills                     in  preparing  innovative  products  that  could  help                     them earn additional income for their families. Thus,                     different extension activities are being proposed to                     increase the quality of life of the citizens in the said                     barangay.    Non-formal  education  will  help  out-of-                     school children to be able to read, write and count                      and also help the out-of-school youths and adults to                     finish  their  secondary  education.    Also,  livelihood                     programs deemed to strengthen housewives’ skills                     and at the same time, augment the meager income                      Area                                                                                    13                          VI: Extension and Community Involvement","PROGRAM PERFORMANCE PROFILE               BSBM                                  BSIT                       of their families.

This approach has been institutionalized                            and exemplified in CvSU through the concept                            we called UGNAYAN.                       Article 11. Monitoring and Evaluation                          a) Monitoring  continuously  tracks  performance                           against  what  was  planned  by  collecting  and                            analyzing data on the indicators established for                            monitoring  and  evaluation  purposes.    It                            provides  continuous  information  on  whether                            progress  is  being  made  toward  achieving                            results (outputs, outcomes and goals) through                            record keeping and regular reporting systems.                            Monitoring looks at both programme processes                            and changes in conditions of target groups and                           institutions  brought  about  by  programme                            activities.    It  also  identifies  strengths  and                            weaknesses                  in      a       programme.                      The                            performance  information  generated  from                            monitoring enhances learning from experience                            and  improves decision-making.

It  relies  on  data                            generated through monitoring activities as well                            as  information  obtained  from  other  sources                            (e.g.,  studies,  research,  in-depth  interviews,                            focus  group  discussions,  surveys  etc.).

Rationale      :                           The population explosion in Brgy. Bagtas has led to an initiative to alleviate poverty in                  the barangay.  Brgy. Bagtas, having the most number of populations in Tanza (20,370 out of                  188,755),  has  been  the  site  for  relocation  and  reclamation.    However,  people,  who  were                  displaced out of their previous addresses, were relocated in the said barangay without having a                  regular  source  of  living.    Some  of  them  could  not  find  a  decent  job  because  they  lack  the                     Area                                                                                    50                          VI: Extension and Community Involvement","PROGRAM PERFORMANCE PROFILE               BSBM                                  BSIT                     educational and other requirements for the job that they were applying for.  Others could not                  start any business because they lack the skills in preparing innovative products that could help                  them earn additional income for their families.                           Thus, different extension activities are being proposed to increase the quality of life of                  the citizens in the said barangay.  Non-formal education will help out-of-school children to be                  able to read, write and count.  Also, livelihood programs deemed to strengthen housewives skills                  and at the same time, augment the meager income of their families.  In addition, awareness                  drives concerning health and other GAD-related issues are being proposed to inculcate the                  importance of appropriate living condition for every member of the community.               III.   Strategies of Implementation                   A.  Formation of Committee                             A committee was formed to study and gather benchmark information on the status,                      needs,  and  conditions  of  selected  communities  in  Tanza,  Cavite  during  the  second                      semester, AY 2014 – 2015.  The committee was headed by the Extension Coordinator.  Two                      faculty members from the different departments of the campus were selected as members                      of the committee to ensure that the programs will conform to the mandate of the university.                      The committee  used  the  following  benchmark  information,  provided  by  Tanza Municipal                      Planning and Development Office (TMPDO), in order to assess which group of individuals                      will be the target beneficiaries of the proposal.

Data utilized in the study                      mainly  came  from  the  responses  on  the  self-administered  survey  questions  that  were                      distributed to the residents of Brgy.

Preparation of Proposal                             The proposal to conduct extension programs in the community was based upon the                      respondent’s needs and interests that are consistent with the goals of the campus and that                      have been identified through surveys.                              Some  programs  relative  to  the  needs  and  interests  of  the  residents  were  not                      considered due to insufficiencies on facilities and absence of qualified faculty members to                      handle such programs.  This includes recycling of plastic products, water lily bags, and                      perfume-making which may require raw materials that are unavailable from the community.                              While  having  consultative  meetings  with  the  local  government  of  the  concerned                      barangay, some requests to the university were raised.  First, the campus will have to offer                      computer  literacy  program  for  their  barangay  officials.    This  program  aims  to  extend                      computer literacy to the Brgy. officials, who, based on observation, lack with sufficient skills                      in computer manipulation and processes. The LGU believes that technical skills must be                      manifested by their officials to better serve their constituents.                              Also, the LGU requested that the proponents offer literacy skills development among                      their children.  According to them, a number of children were not enrolled in a formal school                      and parents of these children affirm that they could not send them in formal school due to                      lack of financial resources, that although education is free in public schools, they could not                      provide the requirements that their children must submit.                        Area                                                                                    52                          VI: Extension and Community Involvement","PROGRAM PERFORMANCE PROFILE               BSBM                                  BSIT                                Another  request  from  the  LGU  is  that  the  proponent  should  give  awareness                      campaigns on different health issues.  According to them, the increase in the rate of patients                      with dengue and AIDS/HIV in the province had been alarming them and the residents.  And                      because the proponent is a GAD advocate, GAD-related issues and concerns were included                      in this awareness campaign, such as Anti-Violence against Women and their Children (anti-                      VAWC), sexual harassment among others.                   C.  Meeting of the Committee                             A meeting of the campus Committee on Curriculum and Instruction was conducted                      on April 10, 2015 to deliberate on the proposed extension programs in the campus.

Rationale      :                           The population explosion in Brgy. Bagtas has led to an initiative to alleviate poverty in                  the barangay.  Brgy. Bagtas, having the most number of populations in Tanza (20,370 out of                  188,755),  has  been  the  site  for  relocation  and  reclamation.    However,  people,  who  were                  displaced out of their previous addresses, were relocated in the said barangay without having a                  regular  source  of  living.    Some  of  them  could  not  find  a  decent  job  because  they  lack  the                     Area                                                                                    83                          VI: Extension and Community Involvement","PROGRAM PERFORMANCE PROFILE               BSBM                                  BSIT                     educational and other requirements for the job that they were applying for.  Others could not                  start any business because they lack the skills in preparing innovative products that could help                  them earn additional income for their families.                           Thus, different extension activities are being proposed to increase the quality of life of                  the citizens in the said barangay.  Non-formal education will help out-of-school children to be                  able to read, write and count.  Also, livelihood programs deemed to strengthen housewives skills                  and at the same time, augment the meager income of their families.  In addition, awareness                  drives concerning health and other GAD-related issues are being proposed to inculcate the                  importance of appropriate living condition for every member of the community.               III.   Strategies of Implementation                   A.  Formation of Committee                             A committee was formed to study and gather benchmark information on the status,                      needs,  and  conditions  of  selected  communities  in  Tanza,  Cavite  during  the  second                      semester, AY 2014 – 2015.  The committee was headed by the Extension Coordinator.  Two                      faculty members from the different departments of the campus were selected as members                      of the committee to ensure that the programs will conform to the mandate of the university.                      The committee  used  the  following  benchmark  information,  provided  by  Tanza Municipal                      Planning and Development Office (TMPDO), in order to assess which group of individuals                      will be the target beneficiaries of the proposal.

Data utilized in the study                      mainly  came  from  the  responses  on  the  self-administered  survey  questions  that  were                      distributed to the residents of Brgy. Bagtas.  Residents were selected using simple random                      sampling.                        Area                                                                                   84                          VI: Extension and Community Involvement","PROGRAM PERFORMANCE PROFILE               BSBM                                  BSIT                                Results revealed that:                                  •  87.14% of the residents perceived that they lack regular sources of living in                                    the  barangay  because  most  (48.15%)  of  them  lack  the  educational                                    requirements and some (38.99%) lack the technical skills to either start a                                    small business or to apply for a regular job;                                  •  47.06% of the residents believed that these problems and issues may be                                    addressed  through  conduct  of  free  seminars/trainings  on  livelihood                                    programs;                                  •  18.33%  of  the  residents  suggested  to  conduct  free  seminar  on  candle                                    making;  17.33%  suggested  soap  making;  15.33%  suggested  delicacy                                    preparation  such  as  yema,  ube,  leche  flan,  puto,  and  others;  13.67%                                    suggested dishwashing liquid making; 13.00% suggested recycling of plastic                                    products and water lily bags; while the remaining 8.67% suggested perfume-                                    making;                                  •  46.50% of the residents said that they have baking and cooking skills and                                    they are willing to undergo trainings for delicacy preparation; also 22.50%                                    reiterated that they have the skills in the arts and trades and that they are                                    willing to undergo trainings on preparation of innovative products such as                                    candle, soap, and dishwashing liquid;                    B.  Preparation of Proposal                             The proposal to conduct extension programs in the community was based upon the                      respondent’s needs and interests that are consistent with the goals of the campus and that                      have been identified through surveys.                              Some  programs  relative  to  the  needs  and  interests  of  the  residents  were  not                      considered due to insufficiencies on facilities and absence of qualified faculty members to                      handle such programs.  This includes recycling of plastic products, water lily bags, and                      perfume-making which may require raw materials that are unavailable from the community.                              While  having  consultative  meetings  with  the  local  government  of  the  concerned                      barangay, some requests to the university were raised.  First, the campus will have to offer                      computer  literacy  program  for  their  barangay  officials.    This  program  aims  to  extend                      computer literacy to the Brgy. officials, who, based on observation, lack with sufficient skills                      in computer manipulation and processes. The LGU believes that technical skills must be                      manifested by their officials to better serve their constituents.                              Also, the LGU requested that the proponents offer literacy skills development among                      their children.  According to them, a number of children were not enrolled in a formal school                      and parents of these children affirm that they could not send them in formal school due to                      lack of financial resources, that although education is free in public schools, they could not                      provide the requirements that their children must submit.                        Area                                                                                    85                          VI: Extension and Community Involvement","PROGRAM PERFORMANCE PROFILE               BSBM                                  BSIT                                Another  request  from  the  LGU  is  that  the  proponent  should  give  awareness                      campaigns on different health issues.  According to them, the increase in the rate of patients                      with dengue and AIDS/HIV in the province had been alarming them and the residents.  And                      because the proponent is a GAD advocate, GAD-related issues and concerns were included                      in this awareness campaign, such as Anti-Violence against Women and their Children (anti-                      VAWC), sexual harassment among others.                   C.  Meeting of the Committee                             A meeting of the campus Committee on Curriculum and Instruction was conducted                      on April 10, 2015 to deliberate on the proposed extension programs in the campus.                              The following is the decision of the members of the committee:                                        Total Number of Committee Members              :      15                                         Total Number of Committee Members who                                               were present                            :      15                                         Total Number of Committee Members who                                               were absent                             :       0                                         Number of Members in favor of the                                               proposal                                :      15                                         Number of Members not in favor of the                                               proposal                                :       0                               With this result, the following resolutions were passed by the Committee:                               Resolution No. 3, s. 2015                                       “Approving the extension project proposal to alleviate poverty in Barangay                             Bagtas with the following components: (1) Oplan Karunungan; (2) Computer Literacy                             for Brgy.

Since this is an extension project, voluntary participation among faculty and                      students will be encouraged.  Additional funds for the project proposal will be sought through                      donations  from  the  Local  Government  Unit  of  Brgy.

Bagtas has                      led  to  an  initiative  to  alleviate  poverty  in  the                     barangay.  Brgy. Bagtas, having the most number                     of  populations  in  Tanza  (20,370  out  of  188,755),                     has  been  the  site  for  relocation  and  reclamation.                     However, people, who were displaced out of their                     previous  addresses,  were  relocated  in  the  said                     barangay without having a regular source of living.                     Some of them could not find a decent job because                     they  lack  the  educational  and  other  requirements                      for the job that they were applying for.  Others could                     not start any business because they lack the skills                     in  preparing  innovative  products  that  could  help                     them earn additional income for their families.                             Thus,  different  extension  activities  are  being                     proposed  to  increase  the  quality  of  life  of  the                     citizens in the said barangay.

In  addition,  awareness  drives  concerning  health                     and other GAD-related issues are being proposed                     to  inculcate  the  importance  of  appropriate  living                     condition for every member of the community.
