Monitoring and Evaluation                                   Monitoring continuously tracks performance against what was                           planned  by  collecting  and  analyzing  data  on  the  indicators                           established  for  monitoring  and  evaluation  purposes.  It  provides                           continuous  information  on  whether  progress  is  being  made  toward                           achieving  results  (outputs,  outcomes  and  goals)  through  record                           keeping  and  regular  reporting  systems.  Monitoring  looks  at  both                           programmed  processes and changes in conditions of target groups and                           institutions brought about by programmed activities. It also identifies                           strengths  and  weaknesses  in  a  programmed.  The  performance                           information  generated  from  monitoring  enhances  learning  from                           experience       and    improves       decision-making.  Management  and                           programmed implementers typically conduct monitoring.                                   Evaluation  is  a  periodic,  in-depth  analysis  of  programmed                           performance. In relies on data generated through monitoring activities                           as  well  as  information  obtained  from  other  sources  (e.g.,  studies,                           research, in-depth           interviews,  focus  group  discussions,  surveys                           etc.).  Evaluations  are  often  (but  not  always)  conducted  with  the                           assistance of external evaluators (UNFPA, 2004).                            Section 1.
