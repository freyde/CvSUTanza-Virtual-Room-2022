BAGTAS GENERAL ASSEMBLY AND CONSULTATIVE MEETING                          Cavite  State  University  –  Tanza  Campus  held  its  second  general  assembly  and                 consultative meeting on October 5, 2019. The assembly and consultative meeting was held                 from 8:00 a.m. until 4:00 pm at the covered court of Lumina Subdivision where hundreds of                  Bagtas residents participated.                         The  event  started  out  with  the  words  of  welcome  given  by  the  Barangay  Bagtas                 Chairperson,  Engr.  Manuel  T.  Mintu,  Jr.  Then,  he  also  acknowledged  the  Sangguniang                 Barangay Members and Staff as well as the faculty members of the campus.                         After  that,  Mr.  Cris  Albert  P.  Cajigas  delivered  his  message  to  the  residents  of                  Barangay Bagtas about the extension programs of the campus. He talked about the various                 extension programs of the campus. Thus, he explained that different extension activities are                 conducted to increase the quality of life of the citizens in the barangay.  Non-formal education                 will help out-of-school children to be able to read, write and count.  Also, livelihood programs                 deemed to strengthen housewives skills and at the same time, augment the meager income                 of  their  families.    In  addition,  awareness  drives  concerning  health  and  other  GAD-related                 issues are also conducted to inculcate the importance of appropriate living condition for every                  member of the community.                         Furthermore, Mr. Ritch M. Banate, the extension coordinator of the campus introduced                 the  upcoming  activities  of  the  campus  per  extension  programs.  It  was  observed  that  the                 residents of the barangay were really excited to participate in the various activities. This only                 means that the residents or stakeholders of the barangay were really interested to help the                  barangay alleviate poverty.                         After the extension coordinator introduced and explained the extension programs of                 the campus, the residents were given the opportunity to raise their concerns regarding the                 different  problems  they  face  within  their  community.  One  of  those  is  about  the  growing","population in Bagtas as the result of lack of knowledge about reproductive health and family                 planning.  As  a  response,  the  campus  promised  to  conduct  an  extension  activity  about                 reproductive health and family planning in response to their concern. Several questions were                  raised that were really relevant to the formation of various extension activities of the campus.                         The closing remarks of Prof. Mildred A. Sebastian concluded the general assembly                 and consultative meeting. Her message focused on the importance of people’s participation                 in this kind of event as it is a venue for a healthy dialogue where issues and concerns were                 raised  and addressed by  the campus.  This  is  also  a  good strategy  to  better  improve  the                 extension programs of the campus.                         A  total  of  359  participants  attended  the  extension  activity.

There was a big audience in attendance                inside the venue and they were all focused on the words of Hospitality Management instructor,                Mary Rose E. Elamparo. Trainees took down notes while being shown the list of ingredients                 and  the  step-by-step  process.  After  a  demonstration  on  how  to  mix  the  ingredients,  the                trainees started to make their own siomai pieces. Everyone gathered in front to participate                and, in just a couple of moments, the finished products were carted off to the kitchen as the                 resource  person  continued  with  her  discussion  of  pricing  and  selling.  The  guest  speaker                capped  off  the  training  with  a  very  informative  lecture  on  food  processing.  When  Ms.                 Elamparo’s discussion ended, it was time to taste the  cooked siomai pieces made by the                trainees. It was evident on people’s faces how much they loved it. The trainees own-made                siomai was evaluated by the resource person to determine if they are ready to make their own                 siomai and turn it into a profitable business. The results of the evaluation made the trainees                happy and excited as the resource person gave them a good feedback.  The training was                 designed  to  empower  the  Bagtas  residents  to  consider  siomai  making  as  a  business                opportunity to help them earn their own livelihood.
