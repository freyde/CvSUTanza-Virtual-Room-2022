Rationale                               The population explosion in Brgy. Bagtas has led to an initiative to alleviate                         poverty in the barangay. Brgy. Bagtas, having the most population in Tanza (20,370                         out of 188,755), has been the site for relocation and reclamation. However, people,                         who were displaced out of their previous addresses, were relocated in the said barangay                         without having a regular source of living. Some of them could not find a decent job                         because they lack the educational and other requirements for the job that they were                         applying  for.  Others  could  not  start  any  business  because  they  lack  the  skills  in                         preparing innovative products that could help them earn additional income for their","families.                                Thus, different extension activities are being proposed to increase the quality of                         life of the citizens in the said barangay. Non-formal education will help out-of-school                         children to be able to read, write and count. Also, livelihood programs are deemed to                         strengthen housewives’ skills and at the same time, augment the meager income of                         their families. In addition, awareness drives concerning health and other GAD-related                         issues are being proposed to inculcate the importance of appropriate living conditions                         for every member of the community.                     III.   Strategies of Implementation                            A.  Formation of Committee                                      A committee was formed to study and gather benchmark information                               on the status, needs, and conditions of selected communities in Tanza, Cavite                               during the second semester, AY 2014 – 2015. The committee was headed by                               the  Extension  Coordinator.  Two  faculty  members  from  the  different                               departments of the campus were selected as members of the committee to                               ensure that the programs will conform to the mandate of the university. The                               committee  used  the  following  benchmark  information,  provided  by  Tanza                               Municipal Planning and Development Office (TMPDO), in order to assess                               which group of individuals will be the target beneficiaries of the proposal.

Data utilized in                               the  study  mainly  came  from  the  responses  on  the  self-administered  survey                               questions that were distributed to the residents of Brgy. Bagtas. Residents were                               selected using simple random sampling.                                Results revealed that:                                        •  87.14% of the residents perceived that they lack regular sources of                                          living  in  the  barangay  because  most  (48.15%)  of  them  lack  the                                          educational  requirements  and  some  (38.99%)  lack  the  technical                                          skills to either start a small business or to apply for a regular job;","•  47.06% of the residents believed that these problems and issues may                                          be  addressed  through  conduct  of  free  seminars/trainings  on                                          livelihood programs;                                       •  47.06% of the residents believed that these problems and issues may                                          be  addressed  through  conduct  of  free  seminars/trainings  on                                          livelihood programs;                                        •  47.06% of the residents believed that these problems and issues may                                          be  addressed  through  conduct  of  free  seminars/trainings  on                                          livelihood programs;                            B.  Preparation of Committee                                      The  proposal  to  conduct  extension  programs  in  the  community  was                               based upon the respondent’s needs and interests that are consistent with the                               goals of the campus and that have been identified through surveys.                                      Some programs relative to the needs and interests of the residents were                               not  considered  due  to  insufficiencies  on  facilities  and  absence  of  qualified                               faculty members to handle such programs. This includes recycling of plastic                               products, water lily bags, and perfume-making which may require raw materials                               that are unavailable from the community.                                      While having consultative meetings with the local government of the                               concerned  barangay,  some  requests  to  the  university  were  raised.  First,  the                               campus  will  have  to  offer  a  computer  literacy  program  for  their  barangay                               officials and 4P’s members. This program aims to extend computer literacy to                               the Brgy. Officials and selected 4P’s members, who, based on observation, lack                               sufficient skills in computer manipulation and processes. The LGU believes that                               technical  skills  must  be  manifested  by  their  officials  to  better  serve  their                               constituents  and  for  those  4P’s  members  for  employment  and  business                               opportunities.                                       Also,  the  LGU  requested  that  the  proponents  offer  literacy  skills                               development among their children. According to them, a number of children                               were not enrolled in a formal school and parents of these children affirm that                               they could not send them to formal school due to lack of financial resources,                               that although education is free in public schools, they  could not provide the                               requirements that their children must submit.                                       Another  request  from  the  LGU  is  that  the  proponent  should  give                               awareness campaigns on different health issues. According to them, the increase                               in the rate of patients with dengue and AIDS/HIV in the province had been                               alarming them and the residents.

The last procedure is to store it in an airtight container for two days so that the mixture                 will achieve its desired fragrance.                          After the trainer demonstrated the procedures, the participants tried to do their own                 fabric conditioner by following the demonstrated procedures. It can be observed that the                 participants were really serious to make their own fabric conditioner as they believed that                 this is an in-demand product. To sum it up, the training is a success as the participants are                really happy as they are confident to make their fabric conditioner.
